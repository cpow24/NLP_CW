the O

it O

not O

as O

a O

The O
raw O
afternoon O
is O
rawest O
, O
and O
the O
dense O
fog O
is O
densest O
, O
and O
the O

sits O
the O
Lord O
High O

in O
his O
High O
Court O
of O
Chancery O
. O
Never O
can O
there O
come O
fog O
too O
thick O
, O
never O
can O
there O
come O
mud O
and O
mire O
too O
deep O
, O
to O
assort O
with O
the O
groping O
and O
floundering O
condition O
which O
this O
High O
Court O
of O
Chancery O
, O
most O
pestilent O
of O
hoary O
sinners O
, O
holds O
this O
day O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
heaven O
and O
earth O
. O
On O
such O
an O
afternoon O
, O
if O
ever O
, O
the O
Lord O
High O
Chancellor O
ought O
to O
be O
sitting O
here O
-- O
as O
here O
he O
is O
-- O
with O
a O
foggy O
glory O
round O
his O
head O
, O
softly O
fenced O
in O
with O
crimson O
cloth O
and O
curtains O
, O
addressed O
by O
a O
large O
advocate O
with O
great O
whiskers O
, O
a O
little O
voice O
, O
and O
an O
interminable O
brief O
, O
and O
outwardly O
directing O
his O
contemplation O
to O
the O
lantern O
in O
the O
roof O
, O
where O
he O
can O
see O
nothing O
but O
fog O
. O
On O
such O
an O
afternoon O
some O
score O
of O
members O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
of O
Chancery O
bar O
ought O
to O
be O
-- O
as O
here O
they O
are O
-- O
mistily O
engaged O
in O
one O
of O
the O
ten O
thousand O
stages O
of O
an O
endless O
cause O
, O
tripping O
one O
another O
up O
on O
slippery O
precedents O
, O
groping O
knee-deep O
in O
technicalities O
, O
running O
their O
goat-hair O
and O
horsehair O
warded O
heads O
against O
walls O
of O
words O
and O
making O
a O
pretence O
of O
equity O
with O
serious O
faces O
, O
as O
players O
might O
. O
On O
such O
an O
afternoon O
the O
various O
solicitors O
in O
the O
cause O
, O
some O
two O
or O
three O
of O
whom O
have O
inherited O
it O
from O
their O
fathers O
, O
who O
made O
a O
fortune O
by O
it O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
-- O
as O
are O
they O
not O
? O
-- O
ranged O
in O
a O
line O
, O
in O
a O
long O
matted O
well O
( O
but O
you O
might O
look O
in O
vain O
for O
truth O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
) O
between O
the O
registrar O
's O
red O
table O

the O
silk O

mountains O
of O
costly O
nonsense O

piled O
before O
them O

Well O
may O
the O
court O
be O
dim O
, O
with O
wasting O
candles O
here O
and O
there O
; O
well O
may O
the O
fog O
hang O
heavy O
in O
it O
, O
as O
if O
it O
would O
never O
get O
out O
; O
well O
may O
the O
stained-glass O
windows O
lose O
their O
colour O
and O
admit O
no O
light O
of O
day O
into O
the O
place O
; O
well O
may O
the O
uninitiated O
from O
the O
streets O
, O
who O
peep O
in O
through O
the O
glass O
panes O
in O
the O
door O
, O
be O
deterred O
from O
entrance O
by O
its O
owlish O
aspect O
and O
by O
the O
drawl O
, O
languidly O
echoing O
to O
the O
roof O
from O
the O
padded O
dais O
where O
the O
Lord O
High O
Chancellor O
looks O
into O
the O
lantern O
that O
has O
no O
light O
in O
it O
and O
where O
the O
attendant O
wigs O
are O
all O
stuck O
in O
a O
fog-bank O
! O
This O
is O
the O
Court O
of O
Chancery O
, O
which O
has O
its O
decaying O
houses O
and O
its O
blighted O
lands O
in O
every O
shire O
, O
which O
has O
its O
worn-out O
lunatic O
in O
every O
madhouse O
and O
its O
dead O
in O
every O
churchyard O
, O
which O
has O
its O
ruined O
suitor O
with O
his O
slipshod O
heels O
and O
threadbare O
dress O
borrowing O
and O
begging O
through O
the O
round O
of O
every O
man O
's O
acquaintance O
, O
which O
gives O
to O
monied O
might O
the O
means O
abundantly O
of O
wearying O
out O
the O
right O
, O
which O
so O
exhausts O
finances O
, O
patience O
, O
courage O
, O
hope O
, O
so O
overthrows O
the O
brain O
and O
breaks O
the O
heart O
, O
that O
there O
is O
not O
an O
honourable O
man O
among O
its O
practitioners O
who O
would O
not O
give O
-- O
who O
does O
not O
often O
give O
-- O
the O
warning O
, O
" O
Suffer O
any O
wrong O
that O
can O
be O
done O
you O
rather O
than O
come O
here O
! O
" O
Who O
happen O
to O
be O
in O
the O
Lord O
Chancellor O
's O
court O
this O
murky O
afternoon O
besides O
the O
Lord O
Chancellor O
, O
the O
counsel O
in O
the O
cause O
, O
two O
or O
three O
counsel O
who O
are O
never O
in O
any O
cause O
, O
and O
the O
well O
of O
solicitors O
before O
mentioned O
? O
There O
is O
the O
registrar O
below O
the O
judge O
, O
in O
wig O
and O
gown O
; O
and O
there O
are O
two O

, O
or O
privy O
purses O
, O
or O
whatever O
they O
may O

, O
in O
legal O
court O
suits O
. O
These O
are O
all O
yawning O
, O
for O
no O
crumb O
of O
amusement O
ever O
falls O
from O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
( O
the O
cause O
in O
hand O
) O
, O
which O
was O
squeezed O
dry O
years O
upon O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
short-hand O
writers O
, O
the O
reporters O
of O
the O
court O
, O
and O
the O
reporters O
of O
the O
newspapers O
invariably O
decamp O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
regulars O
when O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
comes O
on O
. O
Their O
places O
are O
a O
blank O

Standing O
on O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hall O
, O
the O
better O
to O
peer O
into O
the O
curtained O
sanctuary O
, O
is O
a O
little O
mad O
old O
woman O
in O
a O
squeezed O
bonnet O
who O
is O
always O
in O
court O
, O
from O
its O
sitting O
to O
its O
rising O
, O
and O
always O
expecting O
some O
incomprehensible O
judgment O
to O
be O
given O
in O
her O
favour O
. O
Some O
say O
she O
really O
is O
, O
or O
was O
, O
a O
party O
to O
a O
suit O
, O
but O
no O
one O
knows O
for O
certain O
because O
no O
one O
cares O
. O
She O
carries O
some O
small O
litter O
in O
a O
reticule O
which O
she O
calls O
her O
documents O
, O
principally O
consisting O
of O
paper O
matches O
and O
dry O
lavender O
. O
A O
sallow O
prisoner O
has O
come O
up O
, O
in O
custody O
, O
for O
the O
half-dozenth O
time O
to O
make O
a O
personal O
application O
" O
to O
purge O
himself O
of O
his O
contempt O
, O
" O
which O
, O
being O
a O
solitary O
surviving O
executor O
who O
has O
fallen O
into O
a O
state O
of O
conglomeration O
about O
accounts O
of O
which O
it O
is O
not O
pretended O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
any O
knowledge O
, O
he O
is O
not O
at O
all O
likely O
ever O
to O
do O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
his O
prospects O
in O
life O
are O
ended O
. O
Another O
ruined O
suitor O
, O
who O
periodically O
appears O
from O
Shropshire O
and O
breaks O
out O
into O
efforts O
to O
address O
the O
Chancellor O
at O
the O
close O
of O
the O
day O
's O
business O
and O
who O
can O
by O
no O
means O
be O
made O
to O
understand O
that O
the O
Chancellor O
is O
legally O
ignorant O
of O
his O
existence O
after O
making O
it O
desolate O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
century O
, O
plants O
himself O
in O
a O
good O
place O
and O
keeps O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
judge O
, O
ready O
to O
call O
out O
" O
My O
Lord O
! O
" O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
sonorous O
complaint O
on O
the O
instant O
of O
his O
rising O
. O
A O
few O
lawyers O
' O
clerks O
and O
others O
who O
know O
this O
suitor O
by O
sight O
linger O
on O
the O
chance O
of O
his O
furnishing O
some O
fun O
and O
enlivening O
the O
dismal O
weather O
a O
little O
. O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
drones O
on O
. O
This O
scarecrow O
of O
a O
suit O
has O
, O
in O
course O
of O
time O
, O
become O
so O
complicated O
that O
no O
man O
alive O
knows O
what O
it O
means O
. O
The O
parties O
to O
it O
understand O
it O
least O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
observed O
that O
no O
two O
Chancery O
lawyers O
can O
talk O
about O
it O
for O
five O
minutes O
without O
coming O
to O
a O
total O
disagreement O
as O
to O
all O
the O
premises O
. O
Innumerable O
children O
have O
been O
born O
into O
the O
cause O
; O
innumerable O
young O
people O
have O
married O
into O
it O
; O
innumerable O
old O
people O
have O
died O
out O
of O
it O
. O
Scores O
of O
persons O
have O
deliriously O
found O
themselves O
made O
parties O
in O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
without O
knowing O
how O
or O
why O
; O
whole O
families O
have O
inherited O
legendary O
hatreds O
with O
the O
suit O
. O
The O
little O
plaintiff O
or O
defendant O
who O
was O
promised O
a O
new O
rocking-horse O
when O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
should O
be O
settled O
has O
grown O
up O
, O
possessed O
himself O
of O
a O
real O
horse O
, O
and O
trotted O
away O
into O
the O
other O
world O
. O
Fair O
wards O
of O
court O
have O
faded O
into O
mothers O
and O
grandmothers O
; O
a O
long O
procession O
of O
Chancellors O
has O
come O
in O
and O
gone O
out O
; O
the O
legion O
of O
bills O
in O
the O
suit O
have O
been O
transformed O
into O
mere O
bills O
of O
mortality O
; O
there O
are O
not O
three O
Jarndyces O
left O
upon O
the O
earth O
perhaps O
since O
old O
Tom O
Jarndyce O
in O
despair O
blew O
his O
brains O
out O
at O
a O
coffee-house O
in O
Chancery O
Lane O
; O
but O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
still O
drags O
its O
dreary O
length O
before O
the O
court O
, O
perennially O
hopeless O
. O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
has O
passed O
into O
a O
joke O
. O
That O
is O
the O
only O
good O
that O
has O
ever O
come O
of O
it O
. O
It O
has O
been O
death O
to O
many O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
joke O
in O
the O
profession O
. O
Every O
master O
in O
Chancery O
has O
had O
a O
reference O
out O
of O
it O
. O
Every O
Chancellor O
was O
" O
in O
it O
, O
" O
for O
somebody O
or O
other O
, O
when O
he O
was O
counsel O
at O
the O
bar O
. O
Good O
things O
have O
been O
said O
about O
it O
by O
blue-nosed O
, O
bulbous-shoed O
old O
benchers O
in O
select O
port-wine O
committee O
after O
dinner O
in O
hall O
. O
Articled O
clerks O
have O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
fleshing O
their O
legal O
wit O
upon O
it O
. O
The O
last O
Lord O
Chancellor O
handled O
it O
neatly O
, O
when O
, O
correcting O
Mr. O
Blowers O
, O
the O
eminent O
silk O
gown O
who O
said O
that O
such O
a O
thing O
might O
happen O
when O
the O
sky O
rained O
potatoes O
, O
he O
observed O
, O
" O
or O
when O
we O
get O
through O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
, O
Mr. O
Blowers O
" O
-- O
a O
pleasantry O
that O
particularly O
tickled O
the O
maces O
, O
bags O
, O
and O
purses O
. O
How O
many O
people O
out O
of O
the O
suit O
Jarndyce O
and O
Jarndyce O
has O
stretched O
forth O
its O
unwholesome O
hand O
to O
spoil O
and O
corrupt O
would O
be O
a O
very O
wide O
question O
. O
From O
the O
master O
upon O
whose O
impaling O
files O
reams O
of O
dusty O

" O
Vanity O
was O
the O
beginning O
and O
the O
end O
of O
Sir O
Walter O
Elliot O
's O
character O
; O
vanity O
of O
person O
and O
of O
situation O
. O
He O
had O
been O
remarkably O
handsome O
in O
his O
youth O
; O
and O
, O
at O
fifty-four O
, O
was O
still O
a O
very O
fine O
man O
. O
Few O
women O
could O
think O
more O
of O
their O
personal O
appearance O
than O
he O
did O
, O
nor O
could O
the O
valet O
of O
any O
new O
made O
lord O
be O
more O
delighted O
with O
the O
place O
he O
held O
in O
society O
. O
He O
considered O
the O
blessing O
of O
beauty O
as O
inferior O
only O
to O
the O
blessing O
of O
a O
baronetcy O
; O
and O
the O
Sir O
Walter O
Elliot O
, O
who O
united O
these O
gifts O
, O
was O
the O
constant O
object O
of O
his O
warmest O
respect O
and O
devotion O
. O
His O
good O
looks O
and O
his O
rank O
had O
one O
fair O
claim O
on O
his O
attachment O
; O
since O
to O
them O
he O
must O
have O
owed O
a O
wife O
of O
very O
superior O
character O
to O
any O
thing O
deserved O
by O
his O
own O
. O
Lady O
Elliot O
had O
been O
an O
excellent O
woman O
, O
sensible O
and O
amiable O
; O
whose O
judgement O
and O
conduct O
, O
if O
they O
might O
be O
pardoned O
the O
youthful O
infatuation O
which O
made O
her O
Lady O
Elliot O
, O
had O
never O
required O
indulgence O
afterwards O
. O
-- O
She O
had O
humoured O
, O
or O
softened O
, O
or O
concealed O
his O
failings O
, O
and O
promoted O
his O
real O
respectability O
for O
seventeen O
years O
; O
and O
though O
not O
the O
very O
happiest O
being O
in O
the O
world O
herself O
, O
had O
found O
enough O
in O
her O
duties O
, O
her O
friends O
, O
and O
her O
children O
, O
to O
attach O
her O
to O
life O
, O
and O
make O
it O
no O
matter O
of O
indifference O
to O
her O
when O
she O
was O
called O
on O
to O
quit O
them O
. O

Three O
girls O
, O
the O
two O
eldest O
sixteen O
and O
fourteen O
, O
was O
an O
awful O
legacy O
for O
a O
mother O
to O
bequeath O
, O
an O
awful O
charge O
rather O
, O
to O
confide O
to O
the O
authority O
and O
guidance O
of O
a O
conceited O
, O
silly O
father O
. O
She O
had O
, O
however O
, O
one O
very O
intimate O
friend O
, O
a O
sensible O
, O
deserving O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
, O
by O
strong O
attachment O
to O
herself O
, O
to O
settle O
close O
by O
her O
, O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Kellynch O
; O
and O
on O
her O
kindness O
and O
advice O
, O
Lady O
Elliot O
mainly O
relied O
for O
the O
best O
help O
and O
maintenance O
of O
the O
good O
principles O
and O
instruction O
which O
she O
had O
been O
anxiously O
giving O
her O
daughters O
. O
This O
friend O
, O
and O
Sir O
Walter O
, O
did O
not O
marry O
, O
whatever O
might O
have O
been O
anticipated O
on O
that O
head O
by O
their O
acquaintance O
. O
Thirteen O
years O
had O
passed O
away O
since O
Lady O
Elliot O
's O
death O
, O
and O
they O
were O
still O
near O
neighbours O
and O
intimate O
friends O
, O
and O
one O
remained O
a O
widower O
, O
the O
other O
a O
widow O
. O
That O
Lady O
Russell O
, O
of O
steady O
age O
and O
character O
, O
and O
extremely O
well O
provided O
for O
, O
should O
have O
no O
thought O
of O
a O
second O
marriage O
, O
needs O
no O
apology O
to O
the O
public O
, O
which O
is O
rather O
apt O
to O
be O
unreasonably O
discontented O
when O
a O
woman O
does O
marry O
again O
, O
than O
when O
she O
does O
not O
; O
but O
Sir O
Walter O
's O
continuing O
in O
singleness O
requires O
explanation O
. O
Be O
it O
known O
then O
, O
that O
Sir O
Walter O
, O
like O
a O
good O
father O
, O
( O
having O
met O
with O
one O
or O
two O
private O
disappointments O
in O
very O
unreasonable O
applications O
) O
, O
prided O
himself O
on O
remaining O
single O
for O
his O
dear O
daughters O
' O
sake O
. O
For O
one O
daughter O
, O
his O
eldest O
, O
he O
would O
really O
have O
given O
up O
any O
thing O
, O
which O
he O
had O
not O
been O
very O
much O
tempted O
to O
do O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
succeeded O
, O
at O
sixteen O
, O
to O
all O
that O
was O
possible O
, O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
rights O
and O
consequence O
; O
and O
being O
very O
handsome O
, O
and O
very O
like O
himself O
, O
her O
influence O
had O
always O
been O
great O
, O
and O
they O
had O
gone O
on O
together O
most O
happily O
. O
His O
two O
other O
children O
were O
of O
very O
inferior O
value O
. O
Mary O
had O
acquired O
a O
little O
artificial O
importance O
, O
by O
becoming O
Mrs O
Charles O
Musgrove O
; O
but O
Anne O
, O
with O
an O
elegance O
of O
mind O
and O
sweetness O
of O
character O
, O
which O
must O
have O
placed O
her O
high O
with O
any O
people O
of O
real O
understanding O
, O
was O
nobody O
with O
either O
father O
or O
sister O
; O
her O
word O
had O
no O
weight O
, O
her O
convenience O
was O
always O
to O
give O
way O
-- O
she O
was O
only O
Anne O
. O
To O
Lady O
Russell O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
was O
a O
most O
dear O
and O
highly O
valued O
god-daughter O
, O
favourite O
, O
and O
friend O
. O
Lady O
Russell O
loved O
them O
all O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
in O
Anne O
that O
she O
could O
fancy O
the O
mother O
to O
revive O
again O
. O
A O
few O
years O
before O
, O
Anne O
Elliot O
had O
been O
a O
very O
pretty O
girl O
, O
but O
her O
bloom O
had O
vanished O
early O
; O
and O
as O
even O
in O
its O
height O
, O
her O
father O
had O
found O
little O
to O
admire O
in O
her O
, O
( O
so O
totally O
different O
were O
her O
delicate O
features O
and O
mild O
dark O
eyes O
from O
his O
own O
) O
, O
there O
could O
be O
nothing O
in O
them O
, O
now O
that O
she O
was O
faded O
and O
thin O
, O
to O
excite O
his O
esteem O
. O
He O
had O
never O
indulged O
much O
hope O
, O
he O
had O
now O
none O
, O
of O
ever O
reading O
her O
name O
in O
any O
other O
page O
of O
his O
favourite O
work O
. O
All O
equality O
of O
alliance O
must O
rest O
with O
Elizabeth O
, O
for O
Mary O
had O
merely O
connected O
herself O
with O
an O
old O
country O
family O
of O
respectability O
and O
large O
fortune O
, O
and O
had O
therefore O
given O
all O
the O
honour O
and O
received O
none O
: O
Elizabeth O
would O
, O
one O
day O
or O
other O
, O
marry O
suitably O
. O
It O
sometimes O
happens O
that O
a O
woman O
is O
handsomer O
at O
twenty-nine O
than O
she O
was O
ten O
years O
before O
; O
and O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
if O
there O
has O
been O
neither O
ill O
health O
nor O
anxiety O
, O
it O
is O
a O
time O
of O
life O
at O
which O
scarcely O
any O
charm O
is O
lost O
. O
It O
was O
so O
with O
Elizabeth O
, O
still O
the O
same O
handsome O
Miss O
Elliot O
that O
she O
had O
begun O
to O
be O
thirteen O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
Sir O
Walter O
might O
be O
excused O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
forgetting O
her O
age O
, O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
be O
deemed O
only O
half O
a O
fool O
, O
for O
thinking O
himself O
and O
Elizabeth O
as O
blooming O
as O
ever O
, O
amidst O
the O
wreck O
of O
the O
good O
looks O
of O
everybody O
else O
; O
for O
he O
could O
plainly O
see O
how O
old O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
family O
and O
acquaintance O
were O
growing O
. O
Anne O
haggard O
, O
Mary O
coarse O
, O
every O
face O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
worsting O
, O
and O
the O
rapid O
increase O
of O
the O
crow O
's O
foot O
about O
Lady O
Russell O
's O
temples O
had O
long O
been O
a O
distress O
to O
him O
. O
Elizabeth O
did O
not O
quite O
equal O
her O
father O
in O
personal O
contentment O
. O
Thirteen O
years O
had O
seen O
her O
mistress O
of O
Kellynch O
Hall O
, O
presiding O
and O
directing O
with O
a O
self-possession O
and O
decision O
which O
could O
never O
have O
given O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
being O
younger O
than O
she O
was O
. O
For O
thirteen O
years O
had O
she O
been O
doing O
the O
honours O
, O
and O
laying O
down O
the O
domestic O
law O
at O
home O
, O
and O
leading O
the O
way O
to O
the O
chaise O
and O
four O
, O
and O
walking O
immediately O
after O
Lady O
Russell O
out O
of O
all O
the O
drawing-rooms O
and O
dining-rooms O
in O
the O
country O
. O
Thirteen O
winters O
' O
revolving O
frosts O
had O
seen O
her O
opening O
every O
ball O
of O
credit O
which O
a O
scanty O
neighbourhood O
afforded O
, O
and O
thirteen O
springs O
shewn O
their O
blossoms O
, O
as O
she O
travelled O
up O
to O
London O
with O
her O
father O
, O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
' O
annual O
enjoyment O
of O
the O
great O
world O
. O
She O
had O
the O
remembrance O
of O
all O
this O
, O
she O
had O
the O
consciousness O
of O
being O
nine-and-twenty O
to O
give O
her O
some O
regrets O
and O
some O
apprehensions O
; O
she O
was O
fully O
satisfied O
of O
being O
still O
quite O
as O
handsome O
as O
ever O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
her O
approach O
to O
the O
years O
of O
danger O
, O
and O
would O
have O
rejoiced O
to O
be O
certain O
of O
being O
properly O
solicited O
by O
baronet-blood O
within O
the O
next O
twelvemonth O
or O
two O
. O
Then O
might O
she O
again O
take O
up O
the O
book O
of O
books O
with O
as O
much O
enjoyment O
as O
in O
her O
early O
youth O
, O
but O
now O
she O
liked O
it O
not O

the O

once O

She O
had O
had O
a O
disappointment O

moreover O
, O
which O
that O
book O

the O
history O

the O

The O
heir O

the O
very O
William O
Walter O
Elliot O
, O
Esq. O
, O
whose O
rights O
had O
been O
so O
generously O
supported O
by O
her O
father O
, O
had O
disappointed O
her O
. O
She O
had O
, O
while O
a O
very O
young O
girl O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
known O
him O
to O
be O
, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
her O
having O
no O
brother O
, O
the O
future O
baronet O
, O
meant O
to O
marry O
him O
, O
and O
her O
father O
had O
always O
meant O
that O
she O
should O
. O
He O
had O
not O
been O
known O
to O
them O
as O
a O
boy O
; O
but O
soon O
after O
Lady O
Elliot O
's O
death O
, O
Sir O
Walter O
had O
sought O
the O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
though O
his O
overtures O
had O
not O
been O
met O
with O
any O
warmth O
, O
he O
had O
persevered O
in O
seeking O
it O
, O
making O
allowance O
for O
the O
modest O
drawing-back O
of O
youth O
; O
and O
, O
in O
one O
of O
their O
spring O
excursions O
to O
London O
, O
when O
Elizabeth O
was O
in O
her O
first O
bloom O
, O
Mr O
Elliot O
had O
been O
forced O
into O
the O
introduction O
. O
He O
was O
at O
that O
time O
a O
very O
young O
man O
, O
just O
engaged O
in O
the O
study O
of O
the O
law O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
found O
him O
extremely O
agreeable O
, O
and O
every O
plan O
in O
his O
favour O
was O
confirmed O
. O
He O
was O
invited O
to O
Kellynch O
Hall O
; O
he O
was O
talked O
of O
and O
expected O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
year O
; O
but O
he O
never O
came O
. O
The O
following O
spring O
he O
was O
seen O
again O
in O
town O
, O
found O
equally O
agreeable O
, O
again O
encouraged O
, O
invited O
, O
and O
expected O
, O
and O
again O
he O
did O
not O
come O
; O
and O
the O
next O
tidings O
were O
that O
he O
was O
married O
. O
Instead O
of O
pushing O
his O
fortune O
in O
the O
line O
marked O
out O
for O
the O
heir O
of O
the O
house O
of O
Elliot O
, O
he O
had O
purchased O
independence O
by O
uniting O
himself O
to O
a O
rich O
woman O
of O
inferior O
birth O
. O

The O
" O
Red O
Death O
" O
had O
long O
devastated O
the O
country O
. O
No O
pestilence O
had O
ever O
been O
so O
fatal O
, O
or O
so O
hideous O
. O
Blood O
was O
its O
Avatar O
and O
its O
seal O
-- O
the O
redness O
and O
the O
horror O
of O
blood O
. O
There O
were O
sharp O
pains O
, O
and O
sudden O
dizziness O
, O
and O
then O
profuse O
bleeding O
at O
the O
pores O
, O
with O
dissolution O
. O
The O
scarlet O
stains O
upon O
the O
body O
and O
especially O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
the NOM_PER
victim NOM_PER
, O
were O
the O
pest O
ban O
which O
shut O
him PRON_PER
out O
from O
the O
aid O
and O
from O
the O
sympathy O
of O
his NOM_PER
fellow-men NOM_PER
. O
And O
the O
whole O
seizure O
, O
progress O
and O
termination O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
were O
the O
incidents O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
But O
the O
Prince O
Prospero O
was O
happy O
and O
dauntless O
and O
sagacious O
. O
When O
his O
dominions O
were O
half O
depopulated O
, O
he O
summoned O
to O
his O
presence O
a O
thousand O
hale O
and O
light-hearted O
friends O
from O
among O
the O
knights O
and O
dames O
of O
his O
court O
, O
and O
with O
these O
retired O
to O
the O
deep O
seclusion O
of O
one O
of O
his O
castellated O
abbeys O
. O
This O
was O
an O
extensive O
and O
magnificent O
structure O
, O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
prince O
's O
own O
eccentric O
yet O
august O
taste O
. O
A O
strong O
and O
lofty O
wall O
girdled O
it O
in O
. O
This O
wall O
had O
gates O
of O
iron O
. O
The O
courtiers O
, O
having O
entered O
, O
brought O
furnaces O
and O
massy O
hammers O
and O
welded O
the O
bolts O
. O
They O
resolved O
to O
leave O
means O
neither O
of O
ingress O
nor O
egress O
to O
the O
sudden O
impulses O
of O
despair O
or O
of O
frenzy O
from O
within O
. O
The O
abbey O
was O
amply O
provisioned O
. O
With O
such O
precautions O
the O
courtiers O
might O
bid O
defiance O
to O
contagion O
. O
The O
external O
world O
could O
take O
care O
of O
itself O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
it O
was O
folly O
to O
grieve O
, O
or O
to O
think O
. O
The O
prince O
had O
provided O
all O
the O
appliances O
of O
pleasure O
. O
There O
were O
buffoons O
, O
there O
were O
improvisatori O
, O
there O
were O
ballet-dancers O
, O
there O
were O
musicians O
, O
there O
was O
Beauty O
, O
there O
was O
wine O
. O
All O
these O
and O
security O
were O
within O
. O
Without O
was O
the O
" O
Red O
Death O
" O
. O
It O
was O
towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O
month O
of O
his O
seclusion O
, O
and O
while O
the O
pestilence O
raged O
most O
furiously O
abroad O
, O
that O
the O
Prince O
Prospero O
entertained O
his O
thousand O
friends O
at O
a O
masked O
ball O
of O
the O
most O
unusual O
magnificence O
. O
It O
was O
a O
voluptuous O
scene O
, O
that O
masquerade O
. O
But O
first O
let O
me O
tell O
of O
the O
rooms O
in O
which O
it O
was O
held O
. O
These O
were O
seven O
-- O
an O
imperial O
suite O
. O
In O
many O
palaces O
, O
however O
, O
such O
suites O
form O
a O
long O
and O
straight O
vista O
, O
while O
the O
folding O
doors O
slide O
back O
nearly O
to O
the O
walls O
on O
either O
hand O
, O
so O
that O
the O
view O
of O
the O
whole O
extent O
is O
scarcely O
impeded O
. O
Here O
the O
case O
was O
very O
different O
, O
as O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
from O
the O
duke O
's O
love O
of O
the O
_ O
bizarre O
_ O
. O
The O
apartments O
were O
so O
irregularly O
disposed O
that O
the O
vision O
embraced O
but O
little O
more O
than O
one O
at O
a O
time O
. O
There O
was O
a O
sharp O
turn O
at O
every O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
yards O
, O
and O
at O
each O
turn O
a O
novel O
effect O
. O
To O
the O
right O
and O
left O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
each O
wall O
, O
a O
tall O
and O
narrow O
Gothic O
window O
looked O
out O
upon O
a O
closed O
corridor O
which O
pursued O
the O
windings O
of O
the O
suite O
. O
These O
windows O
were O
of O
stained O
glass O
whose O
colour O
varied O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
prevailing O
hue O
of O
the O
decorations O
of O
the O
chamber O
into O
which O
it O
opened O
. O
That O
at O
the O
eastern O
extremity O
was O
hung O
, O
for O
example O
in O
blue O
-- O
and O
vividly O
blue O
were O
its O
windows O
. O
The O
second O
chamber O
was O
purple O
in O
its O
ornaments O
and O
tapestries O
, O
and O
here O
the O
panes O
were O
purple O
. O
The O
third O
was O
green O
throughout O
, O
and O
so O
were O
the O
casements O
. O
The O
fourth O
was O
furnished O
and O
lighted O
with O
orange O
-- O
the O
fifth O
with O
white O
-- O
the O
sixth O
with O
violet O
. O
The O
seventh O
apartment O
was O
closely O
shrouded O
in O
black O
velvet O
tapestries O
that O
hung O
all O
over O
the O
ceiling O
and O
down O
the O
walls O
, O
falling O
in O
heavy O
folds O
upon O
a O
carpet O
of O
the O
same O
material O
and O
hue O
. O
But O
in O
this O
chamber O
only O
, O
the O
colour O
of O
the O
windows O
failed O
to O
correspond O
with O
the O
decorations O
. O
The O
panes O
here O
were O
scarlet O
-- O
a O
deep O
blood O
colour O
. O
Now O
in O
no O
one O
of O
the O
seven O
apartments O
was O
there O
any O
lamp O
or O
candelabrum O
, O
amid O
the O
profusion O
of O
golden O
ornaments O
that O
lay O
scattered O
to O
and O
fro O
or O
depended O
from O
the O
roof O
. O
There O
was O
no O
light O
of O
any O
kind O
emanating O
from O
lamp O
or O
candle O
within O
the O
suite O
of O
chambers O
. O
But O
in O
the O
corridors O
that O
followed O
the O
suite O
, O
there O
stood O
, O
opposite O
to O
each O
window O
, O
a O
heavy O
tripod O
, O
bearing O
a O
brazier O
of O
fire O
, O
that O
projected O
its O
rays O
through O
the O
tinted O
glass O
and O
so O
glaringly O
illumined O
the O
room O
. O
And O
thus O
were O
produced O
a O
multitude O
of O
gaudy O
and O
fantastic O
appearances O
. O
But O
in O
the O
western O
or O
black O
chamber O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
fire-light O
that O
streamed O
upon O
the O
dark O
hangings O
through O
the O
blood-tinted O
panes O
, O
was O
ghastly O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
and O
produced O
so O
wild O
a O
look O
upon O
the O
countenances O
of O
those O
who O
entered O
, O
that O
there O
were O
few O
of O
the O
company O
bold O
enough O
to O
set O
foot O
within O
its O
precincts O
at O
all O
. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
apartment O
, O
also O
, O
that O
there O
stood O
against O
the O
western O
wall O
, O
a O
gigantic O
clock O
of O
ebony O
. O
Its O
pendulum O
swung O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
a O
dull O
, O
heavy O
, O
monotonous O
clang O
; O
and O
when O
the O
minute-hand O
made O
the O
circuit O
of O
the O
face O
, O
and O
the O
hour O
was O
to O
be O
stricken O
, O
there O
came O
from O
the O
brazen O
lungs O
of O
the O
clock O
a O
sound O
which O
was O
clear O
and O
loud O
and O
deep O
and O
exceedingly O
musical O
, O
but O
of O
so O
peculiar O
a O
note O
and O
emphasis O
that O
, O
at O
each O
lapse O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
musicians O
of O
the O
orchestra O
were O
constrained O
to O
pause O
, O
momentarily O
, O
in O
their O
performance O
, O
to O
harken O
to O
the O
sound O
; O
and O
thus O
the O
waltzers O
perforce O
ceased O
their O
evolutions O
; O
and O
there O
was O
a O
brief O
disconcert O
of O
the O
whole O
gay O
company O
; O
and O
, O
while O
the O
chimes O
of O
the O
clock O
yet O
rang O
, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
the O
giddiest O
grew O
pale O
, O
and O
the O
more O
aged O
and O
sedate O
passed O
their O
hands O
over O
their O
brows O
as O
if O
in O
confused O
revery O
or O
meditation O
. O
But O
when O
the O
echoes O
had O
fully O
ceased O
, O
a O
light O
laughter O
at O
once O
pervaded O
the O
assembly O
; O
the O
musicians O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
and O
smiled O
as O
if O
at O
their O
own O
nervousness O
and O
folly O
, O
and O
made O
whispering O
vows O
, O
each O
to O
the O
other O
, O
that O
the O
next O
chiming O
of O
the O
clock O
should O
produce O
in O
them O
no O
similar O
emotion O
; O
and O
then O
, O
after O
the O
lapse O
of O
sixty O
minutes O
, O
( O
which O
embrace O
three O
thousand O
and O
six O
hundred O
seconds O
of O
the O
Time O
that O
flies O
, O
) O
there O
came O
yet O
another O
chiming O
of O
the O
clock O
, O
and O
then O
were O
the O
same O
disconcert O
and O
tremulousness O
and O
meditation O
as O
before O
. O
But O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
these O
things O
, O
it O
was O
a O
gay O
and O
magnificent O
revel O
. O
The O
tastes O
of O
the O
duke O
were O
peculiar O
. O
He O
had O
a O
fine O
eye O
for O
colours O
and O
effects O
. O
He O
disregarded O
the O
_ O
decora O
_ O
of O
mere O
fashion O
. O
His O
plans O
were O
bold O
and O
fiery O
, O
and O
his O
conceptions O
glowed O
with O
barbaric O
lustre O
. O
There O
are O
some O
who O
would O
have O
thought O
him O
mad O
. O
His O
followers O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
not O
. O
It O
was O
necessary O
to O
hear O
and O
see O
and O
touch O
him O
to O
be O
_ O
sure O
_ O
that O
he O
was O
not O
. O
He O
had O
directed O
, O
in O
great O
part O
, O
the O
movable O
embellishments O
of O
the O
seven O
chambers O
, O
upon O
occasion O
of O
this O
great O
_ O
fête O
_ O
; O
and O
it O
was O
his O
own O
guiding O
taste O
which O
had O
given O
character O
to O
the O
masqueraders O
. O
Be O
sure O
they O
were O
grotesque O
. O
There O
were O
much O
glare O
and O
glitter O
and O
piquancy O
and O
phantasm O
-- O
much O
of O
what O
has O
been O
since O
seen O
in O
" O
Hernani O
" O
. O
There O
were O
arabesque O
figures O
with O
unsuited O
limbs O
and O
appointments O
. O
There O
were O
delirious O
fancies O
such O
as O
the O
madman O
fashions O
. O
There O
were O
much O
of O
the O
beautiful O
, O
much O
of O
the O
wanton O
, O
much O
of O
the O
_ O
bizarre O
_ O
, O
something O
of O
the O
terrible O
, O
and O
not O
a O
little O
of O
that O
which O
might O
have O
excited O
disgust O
. O
To O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
seven O
chambers O
there O
stalked O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
dreams O
. O
And O
these O
-- O
the O
dreams O
-- O
writhed O
in O
and O
about O
taking O
hue O
from O
the O
rooms O
, O
and O
causing O
the O
wild O
music O
of O
the O
orchestra O
to O
seem O
as O
the O
echo O
of O
their O
steps O
. O
And O
, O
anon O
, O
there O
strikes O
the O
ebony O
clock O
which O
stands O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
the O
velvet O
. O
And O
then O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
all O
is O
still O
, O
and O
all O
is O
silent O
save O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
clock O
. O
The O
dreams O
are O
stiff-frozen O
as O
they O
stand O
. O
But O
the O
echoes O
of O
the O
chime O
die O
away O
-- O
they O
have O
endured O
but O
an O
instant O
-- O
and O
a O
light O
, O
half-subdued O
laughter O
floats O
after O
them O
as O
they O
depart O
. O
And O
now O
again O
the O
music O
swells O
, O
and O
the O
dreams O
live O
, O
and O
writhe O
to O
and O
fro O
more O
merrily O
than O
ever O
, O
taking O
hue O
from O
the O
many O
tinted O
windows O
through O
which O
stream O
the O
rays O
from O
the O
tripods O
. O
But O
to O
the O
chamber O
which O
lies O
most O
westwardly O
of O
the O
seven O
, O
there O
are O
now O
none O
of O
the O
maskers O
who O
venture O
; O
for O
the O
night O
is O
waning O
away O
; O
and O
there O
flows O
a O
ruddier O
light O
through O
the O
blood-coloured O
panes O
; O
and O
the O
blackness O
of O
the O
sable O
drapery O
appals O
; O
and O
to O
him O
whose O
foot O
falls O
upon O
the O
sable O
carpet O
, O
there O
comes O
from O
the O
near O
clock O
of O
ebony O
a O
muffled O
peal O
more O
solemnly O
emphatic O
than O
any O
which O
reaches O
_ O
their O
_ O
ears O
who O
indulged O
in O
the O
more O
remote O
gaieties O
of O
the O
other O
apartments O
. O
But O
these O
other O
apartments O
were O
densely O
crowded O
, O
and O
in O
them O
beat O
feverishly O
the O
heart O
of O
life O
. O
And O
the O
revel O
went O
whirlingly O
on O
, O
until O
at O
length O
there O
commenced O
the O
sounding O
of O
midnight O
upon O
the O
clock O
. O
And O
then O
the O
music O
ceased O
, O
as O
I O
have O
told O
; O
and O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
waltzers O
were O
quieted O
; O
and O
there O
was O
an O
uneasy O
cessation O
of O
all O
things O
as O
before O
. O
But O
now O
there O
were O
twelve O
strokes O
to O
be O
sounded O
by O
the O
bell O
of O
the O
clock O
; O
and O
thus O
it O
happened O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
more O
of O
thought O
crept O
, O
with O
more O
of O
time O
, O
into O
the O
meditations O
of O
the O
thoughtful O
among O
those O
who O
revelled O
. O
And O
thus O
too O
, O
it O
happened O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
before O
the O
last O
echoes O
of O
the O
last O
chime O
had O
utterly O
sunk O
into O
silence O
, O
there O
were O
many O
individuals O
in O
the O
crowd O
who O
had O
found O
leisure O
to O
become O
aware O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
masked O
figure O
which O
had O
arrested O
the O
attention O
of O
no O
single O
individual O
before O
. O
And O
the O
rumour O
of O
this O
new O
presence O
having O
spread O
itself O
whisperingly O
around O
, O
there O
arose O
at O
length O
from O
the O
whole O
company O
a O
buzz O
, O
or O
murmur O
, O
expressive O
of O
disapprobation O
and O
surprise O
-- O
then O
, O
finally O
, O
of O
terror O
, O
of O
horror O
, O
and O
of O
disgust O
. O
In O
an O
assembly O
of O
phantasms O
such O
as O
I O
have O
painted O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
supposed O
that O
no O
ordinary O
appearance O
could O
have O
excited O
such O
sensation O
. O
In O
truth O
the O
masquerade O
licence O
of O
the O
night O
was O
nearly O
unlimited O
; O
but O
the O
figure O
in O
question O
had O
out-Heroded O
Herod O
, O
and O
gone O
beyond O
the O
bounds O
of O
even O
the O
prince O
's O
indefinite O
decorum O
. O
There O
are O
chords O
in O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
most O
reckless O
which O
can O
not O
be O
touched O
without O
emotion O
. O
Even O
with O
the O
utterly O
lost O
, O
to O
whom O
life O
and O
death O
are O
equally O
jests O
, O
there O
are O
matters O
of O
which O
no O
jest O
can O
be O
made O
. O
The O
whole O
company O
, O
indeed O
, O
seemed O
now O
deeply O
to O
feel O
that O
in O
the O
costume O
and O
bearing O
of O
the O
stranger O
neither O
wit O
nor O
propriety O
existed O
. O
The O
figure O
was O
tall O
and O
gaunt O
, O
and O
shrouded O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
in O
the O
habiliments O
of O
the O
grave O
. O
The O
mask O
which O
concealed O
the O
visage O
was O
made O
so O
nearly O
to O
resemble O
the O
countenance O
of O
a O
stiffened O
corpse O
that O
the O
closest O
scrutiny O
must O
have O
had O
difficulty O
in O
detecting O
the O
cheat O
. O
And O
yet O
all O
this O
might O
have O
been O
endured O
, O
if O
not O
approved O
, O
by O
the O
mad O
revellers O
around O
. O
But O
the O
mummer O
had O
gone O
so O
far O
as O
to O
assume O
the O
type O
of O
the O
Red O
Death O
. O
His O
vesture O
was O
dabbled O
in O
_ O
blood O
_ O
-- O
and O
his O
broad O
brow O
, O
with O
all O
the O
features O
of O
the O
face O
, O
was O
besprinkled O
with O
the O
scarlet O
horror O
. O

I O
On O
an O
evening O
in O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
May O
a NOM_PER
middle-aged NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
was O
walking O
homeward O
from O
Shaston O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Marlott O
, O
in O
the O
adjoining O
Vale O
of O
Blakemore O
, O
or O
Blackmoor O
. O
The O
pair O
of O
legs O
that O
carried O
him PRON_PER
were O
rickety O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
bias O
in O
his PRON_PER
gait O
which O
inclined O
him PRON_PER
somewhat O
to O
the O
left O
of O
a O
straight O
line O
. O
He PRON_PER
occasionally O
gave O
a O
smart O
nod O
, O
as O
if O
in O
confirmation O
of O
some O
opinion O
, O
though O
he PRON_PER
was O
not O
thinking O
of O
anything O
in O
particular O
. O
An O
empty O
egg-basket O
was O
slung O
upon O
his PRON_PER
arm O
, O
the O
nap O
of O
his PRON_PER
hat O
was O
ruffled O
, O
a O
patch O
being O
quite O
worn O
away O
at O
its O
brim O
where O
his PRON_PER
thumb O
came O
in O
taking O
it O
off O
. O
Presently O
he PRON_PER
was O
met O
by O
an NOM_PER
elderly NOM_PER
parson NOM_PER
astride NOM_PER
on NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
gray NOM_PER
mare NOM_PER
, O
who O
, O
as O
he PRON_PER
rode O
, O
hummed O
a O
wandering O
tune O

" O

The NOM_PER

after O

halted O

Throw O
up O
your O

a O
moment O

so O
that O

may O

Yes O
, O
that O
's O
the O
d'Urberville O
nose O
and O

-- O
a O
little O
debased O

Your O
ancestor O
was O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
knights O
who O
assisted O
the O
Lord O
of O
Estremavilla O
in O
Normandy O
in O
his O
conquest O

Branches O
of O
your O

; O
their O
names O
appear O
in O
the O
Pipe O
Rolls O
in O
the O
time O
of O
King O
Stephen O
. O
In O
the O
reign O
of O
King O
John O
one O
of O
them O
was O
rich O
enough O
to O
give O
a O
manor O
to O
the O
Knights O
Hospitallers O
; O
and O
in O
Edward O
the O
Second O
's O
time O
your O
forefather O
Brian O
was O
summoned O
to O
Westminster O
to O
attend O
the O
great O
Council O
there O

You O
declined O
a O
little O
in O
Oliver O
Cromwell O

time O
, O
but O
to O
no O
serious O
extent O
, O
and O
in O
Charles O
the O
Second O
's O
reign O
you O
were O
made O
Knights O
of O
the O
Royal O
Oak O
for O
your O
loyalty O

Aye O
, O
there O
have O
been O
generations O
of O
Sir O
Johns O
among O
you O
, O
and O
if O
knighthood O
were O
hereditary O
, O
like O
a O
baronetcy O
, O
as O
it O
practically O
was O
in O
old O
times O
, O
when O
men O
were O
knighted O

" O
" O
Ye O
do O

say O
so O
! O
" O
" O
In O
short O
, O
" O
concluded O
the O
parson O
, O
decisively O
smacking O
his O
leg O
with O
his O
switch O
, O
" O
there O

hardly O
such O
another O

" O
" O
Daze O
my O
eyes O

and O
is O
n't O
there O
? O
" O
said O
Durbeyfield O
. O
" O
And O
here O
have O
I O
been O
knocking O
about O
, O
year O
after O
year O
, O
from O
pillar O
to O
post O
, O
as O
if O
I O
was O
no O
more O
than O
the O
commonest O
feller O
in O
the O
parish O
... O
And O
how O
long O
hev O
this O
news O
about O
me O
been O
knowed O
, O
Pa O
' O
son O
Tringham O
? O
" O
The O
clergyman O
explained O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
aware O
, O
it O
had O
quite O
died O
out O
of O
knowledge O
, O
and O
could O
hardly O
be O
said O
to O
be O
known O
at O
all O
. O
His O
own O
investigations O
had O
begun O
on O
a O
day O
in O
the O
preceding O
spring O
when O
, O
having O
been O
engaged O
in O
tracing O
the O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
d'Urberville O
family O
, O
he O
had O
observed O
Durbeyfield O
's O
name O
on O
his O
waggon O
, O
and O
had O
thereupon O
been O
led O
to O
make O
inquiries O
about O
his O
father O
and O
grandfather O
till O
he O
had O
no O
doubt O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
At O
first O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
disturb O
you O
with O
such O
a O
useless O
piece O
of O
information O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
However O
, O
our O
impulses O
are O
too O
strong O
for O
our O
judgement O
sometimes O
. O
I O
thought O
you O
might O
perhaps O
know O
something O
of O
it O
all O
the O
while O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
't O
is O
true O
, O
that O
my O
family O
had O
seen O
better O
days O
afore O
they O
came O
to O
Blackmoor O
. O
But O
I O
took O
no O
notice O
o O
' O
t O
, O
thinking O
it O
to O
mean O
that O
we O
had O
once O
kept O
two O
horses O
where O
we O
now O
keep O
only O
one O

I O
've O
got O
a O
wold O
silver O
spoon O

a O
wold O
graven O

, O
Lord O

what O
's O
a O
spoon O

And O
to O
think O
that O
I O

noble O
d'Urbervilles O

one O
flesh O
all O
the O
time O

pause O

nothing O

nothing O

evening O

enough O

" O
Concluding O
thus O
, O
the O
parson O
rode O
on O
his O
way O
, O
with O
doubts O
as O
to O
his O
discretion O
in O
retailing O
this O
curious O
bit O
of O
lore O
. O
When O
he O
was O
gone O
, O
Durbeyfield O
walked O
a O
few O
steps O
in O
a O
profound O
reverie O
, O
and O
then O
sat O
down O
upon O
the O
grassy O
bank O
by O
the O
roadside O
, O
depositing O
his O
basket O
before O
him O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
a O
youth O
appeared O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
walking O
in O
the O
same O
direction O
as O
that O
which O
had O
been O
pursued O
by O
Durbeyfield O
. O
The O
latter O
, O
on O
seeing O
him O
, O
held O
up O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
the O
lad O
quickened O
his O
pace O

came O
near O
. O
" O

up O

basket O

announcement O

Durbeyfield O
, O
declining O
from O
his O
sitting O

, O
luxuriously O
stretched O
himself O
out O
upon O
the O
bank O
among O
the O
daisies O
. O
The O
lad O
stood O
before O
Durbeyfield O
, O
and O
contemplated O
his O
length O
from O
crown O
to O
toe O

Durbeyfield O

I PRON_PER
am O
a NOM_PER
rather NOM_PER
elderly NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
. O
The O
nature O
of O
my PRON_PER
avocations O
for O
the O
last O
thirty O
years O
has O
brought O
me PRON_PER
into O
more O
than O
ordinary O
contact O
with O
what O
would O
seem O
an NOM_PER
interesting NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
somewhat NOM_PER
singular NOM_PER
set NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
, O
of O
whom O
as O
yet O
nothing O
that O
I O
know O
of O
has O
ever O
been O
written O
: O
-- O
I O
mean O
the O
law-copyists O
or O
scriveners O
. O
I O
have O
known O
very O
many O
of O
them O
, O
professionally O
and O
privately O
, O
and O
if O
I O
pleased O
, O
could O
relate O
divers O
histories O
, O
at O
which O
good-natured O
gentlemen O
might O
smile O
, O
and O
sentimental O
souls O
might O
weep O
. O
But O
I O
waive O
the O
biographies O
of O
all O
other O
scriveners O
for O
a O
few O
passages O
in O
the O
life O
of O
Bartleby O
, O
who O
was O
a O
scrivener O
of O
the O
strangest O
I O
ever O
saw O
or O
heard O
of O
. O
While O
of O
other O
law-copyists O
I O
might O
write O
the O
complete O
life O
, O
of O
Bartleby O
nothing O
of O
that O
sort O
can O
be O
done O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
no O
materials O
exist O
for O
a O
full O
and O
satisfactory O
biography O
of O
this O
man O
. O
It O
is O
an O
irreparable O
loss O
to O
literature O
. O
Bartleby O
was O
one O
of O
those O
beings O
of O
whom O
nothing O
is O
ascertainable O
, O
except O
from O
the O
original O
sources O
, O
and O
in O
his O
case O
those O
are O
very O
small O
. O
What O
my O
own O
astonished O
eyes O
saw O
of O
Bartleby O
, O
_ O
that O
_ O
is O
all O
I O
know O
of O
him O
, O
except O
, O
indeed O
, O
one O
vague O
report O
which O
will O
appear O
in O
the O
sequel O
. O
Ere O
introducing O
the O
scrivener O
, O
as O
he O
first O
appeared O
to O
me O
, O
it O
is O
fit O
I O
make O
some O
mention O
of O
myself O
, O
my O
_ O
employees O
_ O
, O
my O
business O
, O
my O
chambers O
, O
and O
general O
surroundings O
; O
because O
some O
such O
description O
is O
indispensable O
to O
an O
adequate O
understanding O
of O
the O
chief O
character O
about O
to O
be O
presented O
. O
Imprimis O
: O
I O
am O
a O
man O
who O
, O
from O
his O
youth O
upwards O
, O
has O
been O
filled O
with O
a O
profound O
conviction O
that O
the O
easiest O
way O
of O
life O
is O
the O
best O
. O
Hence O
, O
though O
I O
belong O
to O
a O
profession O
proverbially O
energetic O
and O
nervous O
, O
even O
to O
turbulence O
, O
at O
times O
, O
yet O
nothing O
of O
that O
sort O
have O
I O
ever O
suffered O
to O
invade O
my O
peace O
. O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
unambitious O
lawyers O
who O
never O
addresses O
a O
jury O
, O
or O
in O
any O
way O
draws O
down O
public O
applause O
; O
but O
in O
the O
cool O
tranquility O
of O
a O
snug O
retreat O
, O
do O
a O
snug O
business O
among O
rich O
men O
's O
bonds O
and O
mortgages O
and O
title-deeds O
. O
All O
who O
know O
me O
, O
consider O
me O
an O
eminently O
_ O
safe O
_ O
man O
. O
The O
late O
John O
Jacob O
Astor O
, O
a O
personage O
little O
given O
to O
poetic O
enthusiasm O
, O
had O
no O
hesitation O
in O
pronouncing O
my O
first O
grand O
point O
to O
be O
prudence O
; O
my O
next O
, O
method O
. O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
it O
in O
vanity O
, O
but O
simply O
record O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
unemployed O
in O
my O
profession O
by O
the O
late O
John O
Jacob O
Astor O
; O
a O
name O
which O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
I O
love O
to O
repeat O
, O
for O
it O
hath O
a O
rounded O
and O
orbicular O
sound O
to O
it O
, O
and O
rings O
like O
unto O
bullion O
. O
I O
will O
freely O
add O
, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
late O
John O
Jacob O
Astor O
's O
good O
opinion O
. O
Some O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
period O
at O
which O
this O
little O
history O
begins O
, O
my O
avocations O
had O
been O
largely O
increased O
. O
The O
good O
old O
office O
, O
now O
extinct O
in O
the O
State O
of O
New O
York O
, O
of O
a O
Master O
in O
Chancery O
, O
had O
been O
conferred O
upon O
me O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
very O
arduous O
office O
, O
but O
very O
pleasantly O
remunerative O
. O
I O
seldom O
lose O
my O
temper O
; O
much O
more O
seldom O
indulge O
in O
dangerous O
indignation O
at O
wrongs O
and O
outrages O
; O
but O
I O
must O
be O
permitted O
to O
be O
rash O
here O
and O
declare O
, O
that O
I O
consider O
the O
sudden O
and O
violent O
abrogation O
of O
the O
office O
of O
Master O
in O
Chancery O
, O
by O
the O
new O
Constitution O
, O
as O
a O
-- O
premature O
act O
; O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
had O
counted O
upon O
a O
life-lease O
of O
the O
profits O
, O
whereas O
I O
only O
received O
those O
of O
a O
few O
short O
years O
. O
But O
this O
is O
by O
the O
way O
. O
My O
chambers O
were O
up O
stairs O
at O
No O
. O
-- O
Wall-street O
. O
At O
one O
end O
they O
looked O
upon O
the O
white O
wall O
of O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
spacious O
sky-light O
shaft O
, O
penetrating O
the O
building O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O
This O
view O
might O
have O
been O
considered O
rather O
tame O
than O
otherwise O
, O
deficient O
in O
what O
landscape O
painters O
call O
" O
life O
. O
" O
But O
if O
so O
, O
the O
view O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
my O
chambers O
offered O
, O
at O
least O
, O
a O
contrast O
, O
if O
nothing O
more O
. O
In O
that O
direction O
my O
windows O
commanded O
an O
unobstructed O
view O
of O
a O
lofty O
brick O
wall O
, O
black O
by O
age O
and O
everlasting O
shade O
; O
which O
wall O
required O
no O
spy-glass O
to O
bring O
out O
its O
lurking O
beauties O
, O
but O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
near-sighted O
spectators O
, O
was O
pushed O
up O
to O
within O
ten O
feet O
of O
my O
window O
panes O
. O
Owing O
to O
the O
great O
height O
of O
the O
surrounding O
buildings O
, O
and O
my O
chambers O
being O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
, O
the O
interval O
between O
this O
wall O
and O
mine O
not O
a O
little O
resembled O
a O
huge O
square O
cistern O
. O
At O
the O
period O
just O
preceding O
the O
advent O
of O
Bartleby O
, O
I O
had O
two O
persons O
as O
copyists O
in O
my O
employment O
, O
and O
a O
promising O
lad O
as O
an O
office-boy O
. O
First O
, O
Turkey O
; O
second O
, O
Nippers O
; O
third O
, O
Ginger O
Nut O
. O
These O
may O
seem O
names O
, O
the O
like O
of O
which O
are O
not O
usually O
found O
in O
the O
Directory O
. O
In O
truth O
they O
were O
nicknames O
, O
mutually O
conferred O
upon O
each O
other O
by O
my O
three O
clerks O
, O
and O
were O
deemed O
expressive O
of O
their O
respective O
persons O
or O
characters O
. O
Turkey O
was O
a O
short O
, O
pursy O
Englishman O
of O
about O
my O
own O
age O
, O
that O
is O
, O
somewhere O
not O
far O
from O
sixty O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
, O
one O
might O
say O
, O
his O
face O
was O
of O
a O
fine O
florid O
hue O
, O
but O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
-- O
his O
dinner O
hour O
-- O
it O
blazed O
like O
a O
grate O
full O
of O
Christmas O
coals O
; O
and O
continued O
blazing O
-- O
but O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
with O
a O
gradual O
wane O
-- O
till O
6 O
o'clock O
, O
P.M. O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
after O
which O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
of O
the O
proprietor O
of O
the O
face O
, O
which O
gaining O
its O
meridian O
with O
the O
sun O
, O
seemed O
to O
set O
with O
it O
, O
to O
rise O
, O
culminate O
, O
and O
decline O
the O
following O
day O
, O
with O
the O
like O
regularity O
and O
undiminished O
glory O
. O
There O
are O
many O
singular O
coincidences O
I O
have O
known O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my O
life O
, O
not O
the O
least O
among O
which O
was O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
exactly O
when O
Turkey O
displayed O
his O
fullest O
beams O
from O
his O
red O
and O
radiant O
countenance O
, O
just O
then O
, O
too O
, O
at O
that O
critical O
moment O
, O
began O
the O
daily O
period O
when O
I O
considered O
his O
business O
capacities O
as O
seriously O
disturbed O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
twenty-four O
hours O
. O
Not O
that O
he O
was O
absolutely O
idle O
, O
or O
averse O
to O
business O
then O
; O
far O
from O
it O
. O
The O
difficulty O
was O
, O
he O
was O
apt O
to O
be O
altogether O
too O
energetic O
. O
There O
was O
a O
strange O
, O
inflamed O
, O
flurried O
, O
flighty O
recklessness O
of O
activity O
about O
him O
. O
He O
would O
be O
incautious O
in O
dipping O
his O
pen O
into O
his O
inkstand O
. O
All O
his O
blots O
upon O
my O
documents O
, O
were O
dropped O
there O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
. O
Indeed O
, O
not O
only O
would O
he O
be O
reckless O
and O
sadly O
given O
to O
making O
blots O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
but O
some O
days O
he O
went O
further O
, O
and O
was O
rather O
noisy O
. O
At O
such O
times O
, O
too O
, O
his O
face O
flamed O
with O
augmented O
blazonry O
, O
as O
if O
cannel O
coal O
had O
been O
heaped O
on O
anthracite O
. O
He O
made O
an O
unpleasant O
racket O
with O
his O
chair O
; O
spilled O
his O
sand-box O
; O
in O
mending O
his O
pens O
, O
impatiently O
split O
them O
all O
to O
pieces O
, O
and O
threw O
them O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
a O
sudden O
passion O
; O
stood O
up O
and O
leaned O
over O
his O
table O
, O
boxing O
his O
papers O
about O
in O
a O
most O
indecorous O
manner O
, O
very O
sad O
to O
behold O
in O
an O
elderly O
man O
like O
him O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
as O
he O
was O
in O
many O
ways O
a O
most O
valuable O
person O
to O
me O
, O
and O
all O
the O
time O
before O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
meridian O
, O
was O
the O
quickest O
, O
steadiest O
creature O
too O
, O
accomplishing O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
work O
in O
a O
style O
not O
easy O
to O
be O
matched O
-- O
for O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
overlook O
his O
eccentricities O
, O
though O
indeed O
, O
occasionally O
, O
I O
remonstrated O
with O
him O
. O
I O
did O
this O
very O
gently O
, O
however O
, O
because O
, O
though O
the O
civilest O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
blandest O
and O
most O
reverential O
of O
men O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
yet O
in O
the O
afternoon O
he O
was O
disposed O
, O
upon O
provocation O
, O
to O
be O
slightly O
rash O
with O
his O
tongue O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
insolent O
. O
Now O
, O
valuing O
his O
morning O
services O
as O
I O
did O
, O
and O
resolved O
not O
to O
lose O
them O
; O
yet O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
made O
uncomfortable O
by O
his O
inflamed O
ways O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
; O
and O
being O
a O
man O
of O
peace O
, O
unwilling O
by O
my O
admonitions O
to O
call O
forth O
unseemly O
retorts O
from O
him O
; O
I O
took O
upon O
me O
, O
one O
Saturday O
noon O
( O
he O
was O
always O
worse O
on O
Saturdays O
) O
, O
to O
hint O
to O
him O
, O
very O
kindly O
, O
that O
perhaps O
now O
that O
he O
was O
growing O
old O
, O
it O
might O
be O
well O
to O
abridge O
his O
labors O
; O
in O
short O
, O
he O
need O
not O
come O
to O
my O
chambers O
after O
twelve O
o'clock O
, O
but O
, O
dinner O
over O
, O
had O
best O
go O
home O
to O
his O
lodgings O
and O
rest O
himself O
till O
teatime O
. O
But O
no O
; O
he O
insisted O
upon O
his O
afternoon O
devotions O
. O
His O
countenance O
became O
intolerably O
fervid O
, O
as O
he O
oratorically O
assured O
me O
-- O
gesticulating O
with O
a O
long O
ruler O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
room O
-- O
that O
if O
his O
services O
in O
the O
morning O
were O
useful O
, O
how O
indispensable O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
? O
" O
With O
submission O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Turkey O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
" O
I O
consider O
myself O
your O
right-hand O
man O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
I O
but O
marshal O
and O
deploy O
my O
columns O
; O
but O
in O
the O
afternoon O
I O
put O
myself O
at O
their O
head O
, O
and O
gallantly O
charge O
the O
foe O
, O
thus O
! O
" O
-- O
and O
he O
made O
a O
violent O
thrust O
with O
the O
ruler O
. O
" O
But O
the O
blots O
, O
Turkey O
, O
" O
intimated O
I. O
" O
True O
, O
-- O
but O
, O
with O
submission O
, O
sir O
, O
behold O
these O
hairs O
! O
I O
am O
getting O
old O
. O
Surely O
, O
sir O
, O
a O
blot O
or O
two O
of O
a O
warm O
afternoon O
is O
not O
to O
be O
severely O
urged O
against O
gray O
hairs O
. O
Old O
age O
-- O
even O
if O
it O
blot O
the O
page O
-- O
is O
honorable O
. O
With O
submission O
, O
sir O
, O
we O
_ O
both O
_ O
are O
getting O
old O
. O
" O
This O
appeal O
to O
my O
fellow-feeling O
was O
hardly O
to O
be O
resisted O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
go O
he O
would O
not O
. O
So O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
let O
him O
stay O
, O
resolving O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
to O
see O
to O
it O
, O
that O
during O
the O
afternoon O
he O
had O
to O
do O
with O
my O
less O
important O
papers O
. O
Nippers O
, O
the O
second O
on O
my O
list O
, O
was O
a O
whiskered O
, O
sallow O
, O
and O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
rather O
piratical-looking O
young O
man O
of O
about O
five O
and O
twenty O
. O
I O
always O
deemed O
him O
the O
victim O
of O
two O
evil O
powers O
-- O
ambition O
and O
indigestion O
. O
The O
ambition O
was O
evinced O
by O
a O
certain O
impatience O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
mere O
copyist O
, O
an O
unwarrantable O
usurpation O
of O
strictly O
professional O
affairs O
, O
such O
as O
the O
original O
drawing O
up O
of O
legal O
documents O
. O
The O
indigestion O
seemed O
betokened O
in O
an O
occasional O
nervous O
testiness O
and O
grinning O
irritability O
, O
causing O
the O
teeth O
to O
audibly O
grind O
together O
over O
mistakes O
committed O
in O
copying O
; O
unnecessary O
maledictions O
, O
hissed O
, O
rather O
than O
spoken O
, O
in O
the O
heat O
of O
business O
; O
and O
especially O
by O
a O
continual O
discontent O
with O
the O
height O
of O
the O
table O
where O
he O
worked O
. O
Though O
of O
a O
very O
ingenious O
mechanical O
turn O
, O
Nippers O
could O
never O
get O
this O
table O
to O
suit O
him O
. O
He O
put O
chips O
under O
it O
, O
blocks O
of O
various O
sorts O
, O
bits O
of O
pasteboard O
, O
and O
at O
last O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
attempt O
an O
exquisite O
adjustment O
by O
final O
pieces O
of O
folded O
blotting O
paper O
. O
But O
no O
invention O
would O
answer O
. O
If O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
easing O
his O
back O
, O
he O
brought O
the O
table O
lid O
at O
a O
sharp O
angle O
well O
up O
towards O
his O
chin O
, O
and O
wrote O
there O
like O
a O
man O
using O
the O
steep O
roof O
of O
a O
Dutch O
house O
for O
his O
desk O
: O
-- O
then O
he O
declared O
that O
it O
stopped O
the O
circulation O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
If O
now O
he O
lowered O
the O
table O
to O
his O
waistbands O
, O
and O
stooped O
over O
it O
in O
writing O
, O
then O
there O
was O
a O
sore O
aching O
in O
his O
back O
. O
In O
short O
, O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
matter O
was O
, O
Nippers O
knew O
not O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O
Or O
, O
if O
he O
wanted O
any O
thing O
, O
it O
was O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
a O
scrivener O
's O
table O
altogether O
. O
Among O
the O
manifestations O
of O
his O
diseased O
ambition O
was O
a O
fondness O
he O
had O
for O
receiving O
visits O
from O
certain O
ambiguous-looking O
fellows O
in O
seedy O
coats O
, O
whom O
he O
called O
his O
clients O
. O
Indeed O
I O
was O
aware O
that O
not O
only O
was O
he O
, O
at O
times O
, O
considerable O
of O
a O
ward-politician O
, O
but O
he O
occasionally O
did O
a O
little O
business O
at O
the O
Justices O
' O
courts O
, O
and O
was O
not O
unknown O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
Tombs O
. O
I O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
, O
however O
, O
that O
one O
individual O
who O
called O
upon O
him O
at O
my O
chambers O
, O
and O
who O
, O
with O
a O
grand O
air O
, O
he O
insisted O
was O
his O
client O
, O
was O
no O
other O
than O
a O
dun O
, O
and O
the O
alleged O
title-deed O
, O
a O
bill O
. O
But O
with O
all O
his O
failings O
, O
and O
the O
annoyances O
he O
caused O
me O
, O
Nippers O
, O
like O
his O
compatriot O
Turkey O
, O
was O
a O
very O
useful O
man O
to O
me O
; O
wrote O
a O
neat O
, O
swift O
hand O
; O
and O
, O
when O
he O
chose O
, O
was O
not O
deficient O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
sort O
of O
deportment O
. O
Added O
to O
this O
, O
he O
always O
dressed O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
sort O
of O
way O
; O
and O
so O
, O
incidentally O
, O
reflected O
credit O
upon O
my O
chambers O
. O
Whereas O
with O
respect O
to O
Turkey O
, O
I O
had O
much O
ado O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
being O
a O
reproach O
to O
me O
. O
His O
clothes O
were O
apt O
to O
look O
oily O
and O
smell O
of O
eating-houses O
. O
He O
wore O
his O
pantaloons O
very O
loose O
and O
baggy O
in O
summer O
. O
His O
coats O
were O
execrable O
; O
his O
hat O
not O
to O
be O
handled O
. O
But O
while O
the O
hat O
was O
a O
thing O
of O
indifference O
to O
me O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
his O
natural O
civility O
and O
deference O
, O
as O
a O
dependent O
Englishman O
, O
always O
led O
him O
to O
doff O
it O
the O
moment O
he O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
yet O
his O
coat O
was O
another O
matter O
. O
Concerning O
his O
coats O
, O
I O
reasoned O
with O
him O
; O
but O
with O
no O
effect O
. O
The O
truth O
was O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
that O
a O
man O
of O
so O
small O
an O
income O
, O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
sport O
such O
a O
lustrous O
face O
and O
a O
lustrous O
coat O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
time O
. O
As O
Nippers O
once O
observed O
, O
Turkey O
's O
money O
went O
chiefly O
for O
red O
ink O
. O
One O
winter O
day O
I O
presented O
Turkey O
with O
a O
highly-respectable O
looking O
coat O
of O
my O
own O
, O
a O
padded O
gray O
coat O
, O
of O
a O
most O
comfortable O
warmth O
, O
and O
which O
buttoned O
straight O
up O
from O
the O
knee O
to O
the O
neck O
. O
I O
thought O
Turkey O
would O
appreciate O
the O
favor O
, O
and O
abate O
his O
rashness O
and O
obstreperousness O
of O
afternoons O
. O
But O
no O
. O
I O
verily O
believe O
that O
buttoning O
himself O
up O
in O
so O
downy O
and O
blanket-like O
a O
coat O
had O
a O
pernicious O
effect O
upon O
him O
; O
upon O
the O
same O
principle O
that O
too O
much O
oats O
are O
bad O
for O
horses O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
precisely O
as O
a O
rash O
, O
restive O
horse O
is O
said O
to O
feel O
his O
oats O
, O
so O
Turkey O
felt O
his O
coat O
. O
It O
made O
him O
insolent O
. O
He O
was O
a O
man O
whom O
prosperity O
harmed O
. O

CHAPTER O
I O
THERE O
IS O
NO NOM_PER
ONE NOM_PER
LEFT O
When O
Mary PROP_PER
Lennox PROP_PER
was O
sent O
to O
Misselthwaite O
Manor O
to O
live O
with O
her NOM_PER
uncle NOM_PER
everybody O
said O
she O
was O
the O
most O
disagreeable-looking O
child O
ever O
seen O
. O
It O
was O
true O
, O
too O
. O
She O
had O
a O
little O
thin O
face O
and O
a O
little O
thin O
body O
, O
thin O
light O
hair O
and O
a O
sour O
expression O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
yellow O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
yellow O
because O
she O
had O
been O
born O
in O
India O
and O
had O
always O
been O
ill O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
. O
Her O
father O
had O
held O
a O
position O
under O
the O
English O
Government O
and O
had O
always O
been O
busy O
and O
ill O
himself O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
had O
been O
a O
great O
beauty O
who O
cared O
only O
to O
go O
to O
parties O
and O
amuse O
herself O
with O
gay O
people O
. O
She O
had O
not O
wanted O
a O
little O
girl O
at O
all O
, O
and O
when O
Mary O
was O
born O
she O
handed O
her O
over O
to O
the O
care O
of O
an O
Ayah O
, O
who O
was O
made O
to O
understand O
that O
if O
she O
wished O
to O
please O
the O
Mem O
Sahib O
she O
must O
keep O
the O
child O
out O
of O
sight O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O
So O
when O
she O
was O
a O
sickly O
, O
fretful O
, O
ugly O
little O
baby O
she O
was O
kept O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
and O
when O
she O
became O
a O
sickly O
, O
fretful O
, O
toddling O
thing O
she O
was O
kept O
out O
of O
the O
way O
also O
. O
She O
never O
remembered O
seeing O
familiarly O
anything O
but O
the O
dark O
faces O
of O
her O
Ayah O
and O
the O
other O
native O
servants O
, O
and O
as O
they O
always O
obeyed O
her O
and O
gave O
her O
her O
own O
way O
in O
everything O
, O
because O
the O
Mem O
Sahib O
would O
be O
angry O
if O
she O
was O
disturbed O
by O
her O
crying O
, O
by O
the O
time O
she O
was O
six O
years O
old O
she O
was O
as O
tyrannical O
and O
selfish O
a O
little O
pig O
as O
ever O
lived O
. O
The O
young O
English O
governess O
who O
came O
to O
teach O
her O
to O
read O
and O
write O
disliked O
her O
so O
much O
that O
she O
gave O
up O
her O
place O
in O
three O
months O
, O
and O
when O
other O
governesses O
came O
to O
try O
to O
fill O
it O
they O
always O
went O
away O
in O
a O
shorter O
time O
than O
the O
first O
one O
. O
So O
if O
Mary O
had O
not O
chosen O
to O
really O
want O
to O
know O
how O
to O
read O
books O
she O
would O
never O
have O
learned O
her O
letters O
at O
all O
. O
One O
frightfully O
hot O
morning O
, O
when O
she O
was O
about O
nine O
years O
old O
, O
she O
awakened O
feeling O
very O
cross O
, O
and O
she O
became O
crosser O
still O
when O
she O
saw O
that O
the O
servant O
who O
stood O
by O
her O
bedside O
was O
not O
her O
Ayah O
. O
" O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
? O
" O
she O
said O
to O
the O
strange O
woman O
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
let O
you O
stay O
. O
Send O
my O
Ayah O
to O
me O
. O
" O
The O
woman O
looked O
frightened O
, O
but O
she O
only O
stammered O
that O
the O
Ayah O
could O
not O
come O
and O
when O
Mary O
threw O
herself O
into O
a O
passion O
and O
beat O
and O
kicked O
her O
, O
she O
looked O
only O
more O
frightened O
and O
repeated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
Ayah O
to O
come O
to O
Missie O
Sahib O
. O
There O
was O
something O
mysterious O
in O
the O
air O
that O
morning O
. O
Nothing O
was O
done O
in O
its O
regular O
order O
and O
several O
of O
the O
native O
servants O
seemed O
missing O
, O
while O
those O
whom O
Mary O
saw O
slunk O
or O
hurried O
about O
with O
ashy O
and O
scared O
faces O
. O
But O
no O
one O
would O
tell O
her O
anything O
and O
her O
Ayah O
did O
not O
come O
. O
She O
was O
actually O
left O
alone O
as O
the O
morning O
went O
on O
, O
and O
at O
last O
she O
wandered O
out O
into O
the O
garden O
and O
began O
to O
play O
by O
herself O
under O
a O
tree O
near O
the O
veranda O
. O
She O
pretended O
that O
she O
was O
making O
a O
flower-bed O
, O
and O
she O
stuck O
big O
scarlet O
hibiscus O
blossoms O
into O
little O
heaps O
of O
earth O
, O
all O
the O
time O
growing O
more O
and O
more O
angry O
and O
muttering O
to O
herself O
the O
things O
she O
would O
say O
and O
the O
names O
she O
would O
call O
Saidie O
when O
she O
returned O
. O
" O
Pig O
! O
Pig O
! O
Daughter O
of O
Pigs O
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O
because O
to O
call O
a O
native O
a O
pig O
is O
the O
worst O
insult O
of O
all O
. O
She O
was O
grinding O
her O
teeth O
and O
saying O
this O
over O
and O
over O
again O
when O
she O
heard O
her O
mother O
come O
out O
on O
the O
veranda O
with O
some O
one O
. O
She O
was O
with O
a O
fair O
young O
man O
and O
they O
stood O
talking O
together O
in O
low O
strange O
voices O
. O
Mary O
knew O
the O
fair O
young O
man O
who O
looked O
like O
a O
boy O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
a O
very O
young O
officer O
who O
had O
just O
come O
from O
England O
. O
The O
child O
stared O
at O
him O
, O
but O
she O
stared O
most O
at O
her O
mother O
. O
She O
always O
did O
this O
when O
she O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
see O
her O
, O
because O
the O
Mem O
Sahib O
-- O
Mary O
used O
to O
call O
her O
that O
oftener O
than O
anything O
else O
-- O
was O
such O
a O
tall O
, O
slim O
, O
pretty O
person O
and O
wore O
such O
lovely O
clothes O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
like O
curly O
silk O
and O
she O
had O
a O
delicate O
little O
nose O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
disdaining O
things O
, O
and O
she O
had O
large O
laughing O
eyes O
. O
All O
her O
clothes O
were O
thin O
and O
floating O
, O
and O
Mary O
said O
they O
were O
" O
full O
of O
lace O
. O
" O
They O
looked O
fuller O
of O
lace O
than O
ever O
this O
morning O
, O
but O
her O
eyes O
were O
not O
laughing O
at O
all O
. O
They O
were O
large O
and O
scared O
and O
lifted O
imploringly O
to O
the O
fair O
boy O
officer O
's O
face O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
so O
very O
bad O
? O
Oh O
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
Mary O
heard O
her O
say O
. O
" O
Awfully O
, O
" O
the O
young O
man O
answered O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice O
. O
" O
Awfully O
, O
Mrs. O
Lennox O
. O
You O
ought O
to O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
hills O
two O
weeks O
ago O
. O
" O
The O
Mem O
Sahib O
wrung O
her O
hands O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
know O
I O
ought O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
I O
only O
stayed O
to O
go O
to O
that O
silly O
dinner O
party O
. O
What O
a O
fool O
I O
was O
! O
" O
At O
that O
very O
moment O
such O
a O
loud O
sound O
of O
wailing O
broke O
out O
from O
the O
servants O
' O
quarters O
that O
she O
clutched O
the O
young O
man O
's O
arm O
, O
and O
Mary O
stood O
shivering O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
. O
The O
wailing O
grew O
wilder O
and O
wilder O
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
? O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
Mrs. O
Lennox O
gasped O
. O
" O
Some O
one O
has O
died O
, O
" O
answered O
the O
boy O
officer O
. O
" O
You O
did O
not O
say O
it O
had O
broken O
out O
among O
your O
servants O
. O
" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
! O
" O
the O
Mem O
Sahib O
cried O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O
! O
Come O
with O
me O
! O
" O
and O
she O
turned O
and O
ran O
into O
the O
house O
. O
After O
that O
, O
appalling O
things O
happened O
, O
and O
the O
mysteriousness O
of O
the O
morning O
was O
explained O
to O
Mary O
. O
The O
cholera O
had O
broken O
out O
in O
its O
most O
fatal O
form O
and O
people O
were O
dying O
like O
flies O
. O
The O
Ayah O
had O
been O
taken O
ill O
in O
the O
night O
, O
and O
it O
was O
because O
she O
had O
just O
died O
that O
the O
servants O
had O
wailed O
in O
the O
huts O
. O
Before O
the O
next O
day O
three O
other O
servants O
were O
dead O
and O
others O
had O
run O
away O
in O
terror O
. O
There O
was O
panic O
on O
every O
side O
, O
and O
dying O
people O
in O
all O
the O
bungalows O
. O
During O
the O
confusion O
and O
bewilderment O
of O
the O
second O
day O
Mary O
hid O
herself O
in O
the O
nursery O
and O
was O
forgotten O
by O
everyone O
. O
Nobody O
thought O
of O
her O
, O
nobody O
wanted O
her O
, O
and O
strange O
things O
happened O
of O
which O
she O
knew O
nothing O
. O
Mary O
alternately O
cried O
and O
slept O
through O
the O
hours O
. O
She O
only O
knew O
that O
people O
were O
ill O
and O
that O
she O
heard O
mysterious O
and O
frightening O
sounds O
. O
Once O
she O
crept O
into O
the O
dining-room O
and O
found O
it O
empty O
, O
though O
a O
partly O
finished O
meal O
was O
on O
the O
table O
and O
chairs O
and O
plates O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
hastily O
pushed O
back O
when O
the O
diners O
rose O
suddenly O
for O
some O
reason O
. O
The O
child O
ate O
some O
fruit O
and O
biscuits O
, O
and O
being O
thirsty O
she O
drank O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
which O
stood O
nearly O
filled O
. O
It O
was O
sweet O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
strong O
it O
was O
. O
Very O
soon O
it O
made O
her O
intensely O
drowsy O
, O
and O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her O
nursery O
and O
shut O
herself O
in O
again O
, O
frightened O
by O
cries O
she O
heard O
in O
the O
huts O
and O
by O
the O
hurrying O
sound O
of O
feet O
. O
The O
wine O
made O
her O
so O
sleepy O
that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
keep O
her O
eyes O
open O
and O
she O
lay O
down O
on O
her O
bed O
and O
knew O
nothing O
more O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
Many O
things O
happened O
during O
the O
hours O
in O
which O
she O
slept O
so O
heavily O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
disturbed O
by O
the O
wails O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
things O
being O
carried O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
bungalow O
. O
When O
she O
awakened O
she O
lay O
and O
stared O
at O
the O
wall O
. O
The O
house O
was O
perfectly O
still O
. O
She O
had O
never O
known O
it O
to O
be O
so O
silent O
before O
. O
She O
heard O
neither O
voices O
nor O
footsteps O
, O
and O
wondered O
if O
everybody O
had O
got O
well O
of O
the O
cholera O
and O
all O
the O
trouble O
was O
over O
. O
She O
wondered O
also O
who O
would O
take O
care O
of O
her O
now O
her O
Ayah O
was O
dead O
. O
There O
would O
be O
a O
new O
Ayah O
, O
and O
perhaps O
she O
would O
know O
some O
new O
stories O
. O
Mary O
had O
been O
rather O
tired O
of O
the O
old O
ones O
. O
She O
did O
not O
cry O
because O
her O
nurse O
had O
died O
. O
She O
was O
not O
an O
affectionate O
child O
and O
had O
never O
cared O
much O
for O
any O
one O
. O
The O
noise O
and O
hurrying O
about O
and O
wailing O
over O
the O
cholera O
had O
frightened O
her O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
angry O
because O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
alive O
. O
Everyone O
was O
too O
panic-stricken O
to O
think O
of O
a O
little O
girl O
no O
one O
was O
fond O
of O
. O
When O
people O
had O
the O
cholera O
it O
seemed O
that O
they O
remembered O
nothing O
but O
themselves O
. O
But O
if O
everyone O
had O
got O
well O
again O
, O
surely O
some O
one O
would O
remember O
and O
come O
to O
look O
for O
her O
. O
But O
no O
one O
came O
, O
and O
as O
she O
lay O
waiting O
the O
house O
seemed O
to O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
silent O
. O
She O
heard O
something O
rustling O
on O
the O
matting O
and O
when O
she O
looked O
down O
she O
saw O
a O
little O
snake O
gliding O
along O
and O
watching O
her O
with O
eyes O
like O
jewels O
. O
She O
was O
not O
frightened O
, O
because O
he O
was O
a O
harmless O
little O
thing O
who O
would O
not O
hurt O
her O
and O
he O
seemed O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
He O
slipped O
under O
the O
door O
as O
she O
watched O
him O
. O
" O
How O
queer O
and O
quiet O
it O
is O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
It O
sounds O
as O
if O
there O
were O
no O
one O
in O
the O
bungalow O
but O
me O
and O
the O
snake O
. O
" O
Almost O
the O
next O
minute O
she O
heard O
footsteps O
in O
the O
compound O
, O
and O
then O
on O
the O
veranda O
. O
They O
were O
men O
's O
footsteps O
, O
and O
the O
men O
entered O
the O
bungalow O
and O
talked O
in O
low O
voices O
. O
No O
one O
went O
to O
meet O
or O
speak O
to O
them O
and O
they O
seemed O
to O
open O
doors O
and O
look O
into O
rooms O
. O
" O
What O
desolation O
! O
" O
she O
heard O
one O
voice O
say O
. O
" O
That O
pretty O
, O
pretty O
woman O
! O
I O
suppose O
the O
child O
, O
too O
. O
I O
heard O
there O
was O
a O
child O
, O
though O
no O
one O
ever O
saw O
her O
. O
" O
Mary O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
nursery O
when O
they O
opened O
the O
door O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
. O
She O
looked O
an O
ugly O
, O
cross O
little O
thing O
and O
was O
frowning O
because O
she O
was O
beginning O
to O
be O
hungry O
and O
feel O
disgracefully O
neglected O
. O
The O
first O
man O
who O
came O
in O
was O
a O
large O
officer O
she O
had O
once O
seen O
talking O
to O
her O
father O
. O
He O
looked O
tired O
and O
troubled O
, O
but O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
he O
was O
so O
startled O
that O
he O
almost O
jumped O
back O
. O
" O
Barney O
! O
" O
he O
cried O
out O
. O
" O
There O
is O
a O
child O
here O
! O
A O
child O
alone O
! O
In O
a O
place O
like O
this O
! O
Mercy O
on O
us O
, O
who O
is O
she O
! O
" O
" O
I O
am O
Mary O
Lennox O
, O
" O
the O
little O
girl O
said O
, O
drawing O
herself O
up O
stiffly O
. O
She O
thought O
the O
man O
was O
very O
rude O
to O
call O
her O
father O
's O
bungalow O
" O
A O
place O
like O
this O
! O
" O
" O
I O
fell O
asleep O
when O
everyone O
had O
the O
cholera O
and O
I O
have O
only O
just O
wakened O
up O
. O
Why O
does O
nobody O
come O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
the O
child O
no O
one O
ever O
saw O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
man O
, O
turning O
to O
his O
companions O
. O
" O
She O
has O
actually O
been O
forgotten O

PROLOGUE O
IT O
was O
2 O
p.m. O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
May O
7 O
, O
1915 O
. O
The O
_ O
Lusitania O
_ O
had O
been O
struck O
by O
two O
torpedoes O
in O
succession O
and O
was O
sinking O
rapidly O
, O
while O
the O
boats O
were O
being O
launched O
with O
all O
possible O
speed O
. O
The NOM_PER
women NOM_PER
and O
children NOM_PER
were O
being O
lined O
up O
awaiting O
their PRON_PER
turn O
. O
Some NOM_PER
still O
clung O
desperately O
to O
husbands NOM_PER
and O
fathers NOM_PER
; O
others O
clutched O
their NOM_PER
children NOM_PER
closely O
to O
their O
breasts O
. O
One O
girl O
stood O
alone O
, O
slightly O
apart O
from O
the O
rest O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
young O
, O
not O
more O
than O
eighteen O
. O
She O
did O
not O
seem O
afraid O
, O
and O
her O
grave O
, O
steadfast O
eyes O
looked O
straight O
ahead O
. O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
. O
" O
A O
man O
’s O
voice O
beside O
her O
made O
her O
start O
and O
turn O
. O
She O
had O
noticed O
the O
speaker O
more O
than O
once O
amongst O
the O
first-class O
passengers O
. O
There O
had O
been O
a O
hint O
of O
mystery O
about O
him O
which O
had O
appealed O
to O
her O
imagination O
. O
He O
spoke O
to O
no O
one O
. O
If O
anyone O
spoke O
to O
him O
he O
was O
quick O
to O
rebuff O
the O
overture O
. O
Also O
he O
had O
a O
nervous O
way O
of O
looking O
over O
his O
shoulder O
with O
a O
swift O
, O
suspicious O
glance O
. O
She O
noticed O
now O
that O
he O
was O
greatly O
agitated O
. O
There O
were O
beads O
of O
perspiration O
on O
his O
brow O
. O
He O
was O
evidently O
in O
a O
state O
of O
overmastering O
fear O
. O
And O
yet O
he O
did O
not O
strike O
her O
as O
the O
kind O
of O
man O
who O
would O
be O
afraid O
to O
meet O
death O
! O
" O
Yes O
? O
" O
Her O
grave O
eyes O
met O
his O
inquiringly O
. O
He O
stood O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
desperate O
irresolution O
. O
" O
It O
must O
be O
! O
" O
he O
muttered O
to O
himself O
. O
" O
Yes O
-- O
it O
is O
the O
only O
way O
. O
" O
Then O
aloud O
he O
said O
abruptly O
: O
" O
You O
are O
an O
American O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
. O
" O
" O
A O
patriotic O
one O
? O
" O
The O
girl O
flushed O
. O
" O
I O
guess O
you O
’ve O
no O
right O
to O
ask O
such O
a O
thing O

course O
I O
am O
! O

" O
Do O

offended O

You O
would O

be O
if O
you O
knew O
how O
much O
there O
was O
at O
stake O
. O
But O
I O
’ve O
got O
to O
trust O
some O
one O

and O
it O
must O
be O
a O
woman O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
of O
‘ O
women O
and O
children O
first O

’" O
He O
looked O
round O
and O
lowered O
his O
voice O
. O
" O
I O
’m O
carrying O
papers O

vitally O
important O
papers O

They O
may O
make O
all O
the O

You O

papers O
have O

They O
’ve O
more O
chance O

Will O
you O

them O

" O
The O
girl O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
. O
" O
Wait O

I O
must O
warn O
you O

may O
be O

smiled O

it O

The O
two O
young O
people O
greeted O
each O
other O
affectionately O

and O
momentarily O
blocked O
the O
Dover O
Street O
Tube O
exit O
in O
doing O
so O
. O
The O
adjective O
" O
old O
" O
was O
misleading O

Their O
united O
ages O
would O
certainly O
not O
have O
totalled O
forty-five O

" O
Not O

the O

man O

" O
Where O

The O

started O
walking O
down O
Dover O
Street O
towards O
Piccadilly O

" O
Now O

said O
Tommy O

" O
where O
shall O
we O
go O
? O
" O
The O
very O
faint O
anxiety O

underlay O
his O
tone O
did O
not O
escape O
the O
astute O
ears O
of O

" O
And O
Tuppence O
led O
the O
way O
upstairs O
. O
The O
place O
was O
full O
, O
and O
they O
wandered O
about O
looking O
for O
a O
table O
, O
catching O
odds O

ends O
of O

they O
did O
so O

Tommy O

" O
I O
passed O
two O
Johnnies O
in O
the O
street O

you O
ever O
hear O
such O
a O
name O
? O
" O
But O
at O
that O
moment O
two O
elderly O
ladies O
rose O
and O
collected O
parcels O
, O
and O
Tuppence O
deftly O
ensconced O
herself O
in O
one O
of O
the O
vacant O
seats O
. O
Tommy O
ordered O
tea O
and O
buns O
. O
Tuppence O
ordered O
tea O
and O
buttered O
toast O
. O
" O
And O
mind O
the O
tea O
comes O
in O

teapots O

" O
she O
added O
severely O
. O
Tommy O
sat O
down O
opposite O
her O
. O
His O
bared O
head O
revealed O
a O
shock O
of O
exquisitely O
slicked-back O
red O
hair O
. O
His O
face O
was O
pleasantly O
ugly O
-- O
nondescript O
, O
yet O
unmistakably O
the O
face O
of O
a O
gentleman O
and O
a O
sportsman O
. O
His O
brown O
suit O
was O
well O
cut O
, O
but O
perilously O
near O
the O
end O
of O
its O
tether O
. O
They O
were O
an O
essentially O
modern-looking O
couple O
as O
they O
sat O
there O
. O
Tuppence O
had O
no O
claim O
to O
beauty O
, O
but O
there O
was O
character O
and O
charm O
in O
the O
elfin O
lines O
of O
her O
little O
face O
, O
with O
its O
determined O
chin O
and O
large O
, O
wide-apart O
grey O
eyes O
that O
looked O
mistily O
out O
from O
under O
straight O
, O
black O
brows O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
small O
bright O
green O
toque O
over O
her O
black O
bobbed O
hair O
, O
and O
her O
extremely O
short O
and O
rather O
shabby O
skirt O
revealed O
a O
pair O
of O
uncommonly O
dainty O
ankles O
. O
Her O
appearance O
presented O
a O
valiant O
attempt O
at O
smartness O
. O
The O
tea O
came O
at O
last O
, O
and O
Tuppence O
, O
rousing O
herself O
from O
a O
fit O
of O
meditation O

poured O
it O
out O

CHAPTER O
I. O
Down O
the O
Rabbit-Hole O
Alice PROP_PER
was O
beginning O
to O
get O
very O
tired O
of O
sitting O
by O
her NOM_PER
sister NOM_PER
on O
the O
bank O
, O
and O
of O
having O
nothing O
to O
do O
: O
once O
or O
twice O
she O
had O
peeped O
into O
the O
book O
her O
sister O
was O
reading O
, O
but O
it O
had O
no O
pictures O
or O
conversations O
in O
it O
, O
‘ O
and O
what O
is O
the O
use O
of O
a O
book O
, O
’ O
thought O
Alice O
‘ O
without O
pictures O
or O
conversations O
? O
’ O
So O
she O
was O
considering O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
( O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
for O
the O
hot O
day O
made O
her O
feel O
very O
sleepy O
and O
stupid O
) O
, O
whether O
the O
pleasure O
of O
making O
a O
daisy-chain O
would O
be O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
getting O
up O
and O
picking O
the O
daisies O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
White O
Rabbit O
with O
pink O
eyes O
ran O
close O
by O
her O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
so O
VERY O
remarkable O
in O
that O
; O
nor O
did O
Alice O
think O
it O
so O
VERY O
much O
out O
of O
the O
way O
to O
hear O
the O
Rabbit O
say O
to O
itself O
, O
‘ O
Oh O
dear O
! O
Oh O
dear O
! O
I O
shall O
be O
late O
! O
’ O
( O
when O
she O
thought O
it O
over O
afterwards O
, O
it O
occurred O
to O
her O
that O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
wondered O
at O
this O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
it O
all O
seemed O
quite O
natural O
) O
; O
but O
when O
the O
Rabbit O
actually O
TOOK O
A O
WATCH O
OUT O
OF O
ITS O
WAISTCOAT-POCKET O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
it O
, O
and O
then O
hurried O
on O
, O
Alice O
started O
to O
her O
feet O
, O
for O
it O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
she O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
a O
rabbit O
with O
either O
a O
waistcoat-pocket O
, O
or O
a O
watch O
to O
take O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
burning O
with O
curiosity O
, O
she O
ran O
across O
the O
field O
after O
it O
, O
and O
fortunately O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
see O
it O
pop O
down O
a O
large O
rabbit-hole O
under O
the O
hedge O
. O
In O
another O
moment O
down O
went O
Alice O
after O
it O
, O
never O
once O
considering O
how O
in O
the O
world O
she O
was O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
The O
rabbit-hole O
went O
straight O
on O
like O
a O
tunnel O
for O
some O
way O
, O
and O
then O
dipped O
suddenly O
down O
, O
so O
suddenly O
that O
Alice O
had O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
think O
about O
stopping O
herself O
before O
she O
found O
herself O
falling O
down O
a O
very O
deep O
well O
. O
Either O
the O
well O
was O
very O
deep O
, O
or O
she O
fell O
very O
slowly O
, O
for O
she O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
as O
she O
went O
down O
to O
look O
about O
her O
and O
to O
wonder O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
next O
. O
First O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
look O
down O
and O
make O
out O
what O
she O
was O
coming O
to O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
anything O
; O
then O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
well O
, O
and O
noticed O
that O
they O
were O
filled O
with O
cupboards O
and O
book-shelves O
; O
here O
and O
there O
she O
saw O
maps O
and O
pictures O
hung O
upon O
pegs O
. O
She O
took O
down O
a O
jar O
from O
one O
of O
the O
shelves O
as O
she O
passed O
; O
it O
was O
labelled O
‘ O
ORANGE O
MARMALADE O
’ O
, O
but O
to O
her O
great O
disappointment O
it O
was O
empty O
: O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
drop O
the O
jar O
for O
fear O
of O
killing O
somebody O
, O
so O
managed O
to O
put O
it O
into O
one O
of O
the O
cupboards O
as O
she O
fell O
past O
it O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
’ O
thought O
Alice O
to O
herself O
, O
‘ O
after O
such O
a O
fall O
as O
this O
, O
I O
shall O
think O
nothing O
of O
tumbling O
down O
stairs O
! O
How O
brave O
they O
’ll O
all O
think O
me O
at O
home O
! O
Why O
, O
I O
would O
n’t O
say O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
even O
if O
I O
fell O
off O
the O
top O
of O
the O
house O
! O
’ O
( O
Which O
was O
very O
likely O
true O
. O
) O
Down O
, O
down O
, O
down O
. O
Would O
the O
fall O
NEVER O
come O
to O
an O
end O
! O
‘ O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
miles O
I O
’ve O
fallen O
by O
this O
time O
? O
’ O
she O
said O
aloud O
. O
‘ O
I O
must O
be O
getting O
somewhere O
near O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
Let O
me O
see O
: O
that O
would O
be O
four O
thousand O
miles O
down O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
’ O
( O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
Alice O
had O
learnt O
several O
things O
of O
this O
sort O
in O
her O
lessons O
in O
the O
schoolroom O
, O
and O
though O
this O
was O
not O
a O
VERY O
good O
opportunity O
for O
showing O
off O
her O
knowledge O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
, O
still O
it O
was O
good O
practice O
to O
say O
it O
over O
) O
‘ O
-- O
yes O
, O
that O
’s O
about O
the O
right O
distance O
-- O
but O
then O
I O
wonder O
what O
Latitude O
or O
Longitude O
I O
’ve O
got O
to O
? O
’ O
( O
Alice O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
Latitude O
was O
, O
or O
Longitude O
either O
, O
but O
thought O
they O
were O
nice O
grand O
words O
to O
say O
. O
) O
Presently O
she O
began O
again O
. O
‘ O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
shall O
fall O
right O
THROUGH O
the O
earth O
! O
How O
funny O
it O
’ll O
seem O
to O
come O
out O
among O
the O
people O
that O
walk O
with O
their O
heads O
downward O

Antipathies O

( O
she O
was O
rather O
glad O
there O
WAS O
no O
one O
listening O
, O
this O
time O
, O
as O
it O
did O
n’t O
sound O
at O
all O
the O
right O
word O

‘ O
-- O
but O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
ask O
them O
what O
the O
name O
of O
the O
country O
is O
, O
you O
know O
. O
Please O
, O
Ma’am O
, O
is O
this O
New O
Zealand O
or O
Australia O
? O
’ O
( O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
curtsey O
as O
she O
spoke O
-- O
fancy O
CURTSEYING O
as O
you O
’re O
falling O
through O
the O
air O
! O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
manage O
it O
? O
) O
‘ O
And O
what O
an O
ignorant O
little O
girl O
she O
’ll O
think O
me O
for O
asking O
! O
No O
, O
it O
’ll O
never O
do O
to O
ask O
: O
perhaps O
I O
shall O
see O
it O
written O
up O
somewhere O
. O
’ O
Down O
, O
down O
, O
down O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
, O
so O
Alice O
soon O
began O
talking O
again O
. O
‘ O
Dinah O
’ll O
miss O
me O
very O
much O
to-night O
, O
I O
should O
think O
! O
’ O
( O
Dinah O
was O
the O
cat O
. O
) O
‘ O
I O
hope O
they O
’ll O
remember O
her O
saucer O
of O
milk O
at O
tea-time O
. O
Dinah O
my O
dear O
! O
I O
wish O
you O
were O
down O
here O
with O
me O
! O
There O
are O
no O
mice O
in O
the O
air O
, O
I O
’m O
afraid O
, O
but O
you O
might O
catch O
a O
bat O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
very O
like O
a O
mouse O
, O
you O
know O
. O
But O
do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
, O
I O
wonder O
? O
’ O
And O
here O
Alice O
began O
to O
get O
rather O
sleepy O
, O
and O
went O
on O
saying O
to O
herself O
, O
in O
a O
dreamy O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
‘ O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
’ O
and O
sometimes O
, O
‘ O
Do O
bats O
eat O
cats O
? O
’ O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
as O
she O
could O
n’t O
answer O
either O
question O
, O
it O
did O
n’t O
much O
matter O
which O
way O
she O
put O
it O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
dozing O
off O
, O
and O
had O
just O
begun O
to O
dream O
that O
she O
was O
walking O
hand O
in O
hand O
with O
Dinah O
, O
and O
saying O
to O
her O
very O
earnestly O
, O
‘ O
Now O
, O
Dinah O
, O
tell O
me O
the O
truth O
: O
did O
you O
ever O
eat O
a O
bat O
? O
’ O
when O
suddenly O
, O
thump O
! O
thump O
! O
down O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
heap O
of O
sticks O
and O
dry O
leaves O
, O
and O
the O
fall O
was O
over O
. O
Alice O
was O
not O
a O
bit O
hurt O
, O
and O
she O
jumped O
up O
on O
to O
her O
feet O
in O
a O
moment O
: O
she O
looked O
up O
, O
but O
it O
was O
all O
dark O
overhead O
; O
before O
her O
was O
another O
long O
passage O
, O
and O
the O
White O
Rabbit O
was O
still O
in O
sight O
, O
hurrying O
down O
it O
. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
be O
lost O
: O
away O
went O
Alice O
like O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
hear O
it O
say O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
a O
corner O
, O
‘ O
Oh O
my O
ears O
and O
whiskers O
, O
how O
late O
it O
’s O
getting O
! O
’ O
She O
was O
close O
behind O
it O
when O
she O
turned O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
the O
Rabbit O
was O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
seen O
: O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
a O
long O
, O
low O
hall O
, O
which O
was O
lit O
up O
by O
a O
row O
of O
lamps O
hanging O
from O
the O
roof O
. O
There O
were O
doors O
all O
round O
the O
hall O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
locked O
; O
and O
when O
Alice O
had O
been O
all O
the O
way O
down O
one O
side O
and O
up O
the O
other O
, O
trying O
every O
door O
, O
she O
walked O
sadly O
down O
the O
middle O
, O
wondering O
how O
she O
was O
ever O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
little O
three-legged O
table O
, O
all O
made O
of O
solid O
glass O
; O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
it O
except O
a O
tiny O
golden O
key O
, O
and O
Alice O
’s O
first O
thought O
was O
that O
it O
might O
belong O
to O
one O
of O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
hall O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
either O
the O
locks O
were O
too O
large O
, O
or O
the O
key O
was O
too O
small O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
would O
not O
open O
any O
of O
them O
. O
However O
, O
on O
the O
second O
time O
round O
, O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
low O
curtain O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
before O
, O
and O
behind O
it O
was O
a O
little O
door O
about O
fifteen O
inches O
high O
: O
she O
tried O
the O
little O
golden O
key O
in O
the O
lock O
, O
and O
to O
her O
great O
delight O
it O
fitted O
! O
Alice O
opened O
the O
door O
and O
found O
that O
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
passage O
, O
not O
much O
larger O
than O
a O
rat-hole O
: O
she O
knelt O
down O
and O
looked O
along O
the O
passage O
into O
the O
loveliest O
garden O
you O
ever O
saw O
. O
How O
she O
longed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
that O
dark O
hall O
, O
and O
wander O
about O
among O
those O
beds O
of O
bright O
flowers O
and O
those O
cool O
fountains O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
even O
get O
her O
head O
through O
the O
doorway O
; O
‘ O
and O
even O
if O
my O
head O
would O
go O
through O
, O
’ O
thought O
poor O
Alice O
, O
‘ O
it O
would O
be O
of O
very O
little O
use O
without O
my O
shoulders O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
shut O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
! O
I O
think O
I O
could O
, O
if O
I O
only O
knew O
how O
to O
begin O
. O
’ O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
so O
many O
out-of-the-way O
things O
had O
happened O
lately O
, O
that O
Alice O
had O
begun O
to O
think O
that O
very O
few O
things O
indeed O
were O
really O
impossible O
. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
use O
in O
waiting O
by O
the O
little O
door O
, O
so O
she O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table O
, O
half O
hoping O
she O
might O
find O
another O
key O
on O
it O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
a O
book O
of O
rules O
for O
shutting O
people O
up O
like O
telescopes O
: O
this O
time O
she O
found O
a O
little O
bottle O
on O
it O
, O
[ O
‘ O
which O
certainly O
was O
not O
here O
before O
, O
’ O
said O
Alice O
, O
) O
and O
round O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
bottle O
was O
a O
paper O
label O
, O
with O
the O
words O
‘ O
DRINK O
ME O
’ O
beautifully O
printed O
on O
it O
in O
large O
letters O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
well O
to O
say O
‘ O
Drink O
me O
, O
’ O
but O
the O
wise O
little O
Alice O
was O
not O
going O
to O
do O
THAT O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
‘ O
No O
, O
I O
’ll O
look O
first O
, O
’ O
she O
said O
, O
‘ O
and O
see O
whether O
it O
’s O
marked O
" O
poison O
" O
or O
not O
’ O
; O
for O
she O
had O
read O
several O
nice O
little O
histories O
about O
children O
who O
had O
got O
burnt O
, O
and O
eaten O
up O
by O
wild O
beasts O
and O
other O
unpleasant O
things O
, O
all O
because O
they O
WOULD O
not O
remember O
the O
simple O
rules O
their O
friends O
had O
taught O
them O
: O
such O
as O
, O
that O
a O
red-hot O
poker O
will O
burn O
you O
if O
you O
hold O
it O
too O
long O
; O
and O
that O
if O
you O
cut O
your O
finger O
VERY O
deeply O
with O
a O
knife O
, O
it O
usually O
bleeds O
; O
and O
she O
had O
never O
forgotten O
that O
, O
if O
you O
drink O
much O
from O
a O
bottle O
marked O
‘ O
poison O
, O
’ O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
disagree O
with O
you O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O
However O
, O
this O
bottle O
was O
NOT O
marked O
‘ O
poison O
, O
’ O
so O
Alice O
ventured O
to O
taste O
it O
, O
and O
finding O
it O
very O
nice O
, O
( O
it O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
mixed O
flavour O
of O
cherry-tart O
, O
custard O
, O
pine-apple O
, O
roast O
turkey O
, O
toffee O
, O
and O
hot O
buttered O
toast O
, O
) O
she O
very O
soon O
finished O
it O
off O
. O

‘ O
What O
a O
curious O
feeling O
! O
’ O
said O
Alice O
; O
‘ O
I O
must O
be O
shutting O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
. O
’ O
And O
so O
it O
was O
indeed O
: O
she O
was O
now O
only O
ten O
inches O
high O
, O
and O
her O
face O
brightened O
up O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
she O
was O
now O
the O
right O
size O
for O
going O
through O
the O
little O
door O
into O
that O
lovely O
garden O
. O
First O
, O
however O
, O
she O
waited O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
see O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
shrink O
any O
further O
: O
she O
felt O
a O
little O
nervous O
about O
this O
; O
‘ O
for O
it O
might O
end O
, O
you O
know O
, O
’ O
said O
Alice O
to O
herself O
, O
‘ O
in O
my O
going O
out O
altogether O
, O
like O
a O
candle O
. O
I O
wonder O
what O
I O
should O
be O
like O
then O
? O
’ O
And O
she O
tried O
to O
fancy O
what O
the O
flame O
of O
a O
candle O
is O
like O
after O
the O
candle O
is O
blown O
out O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
ever O
having O
seen O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

, O
waiting O
for O
the O
Sunday O
supper O
call O

were O
grouped O
around O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the O
bunk-house O
, O
gossiping O
idly O
of O
things O
purely O
local O
, O
when O
the NOM_PER
Old NOM_PER
Man NOM_PER
returned O
from O
the O
Stock O
Association O
at O
Helena O
; O
beside O
him PRON_PER
on O
the O
buggy O
seat O
sat O
a NOM_PER
stranger NOM_PER
. O
The NOM_PER
Old NOM_PER
Man NOM_PER
pulled O
up O
at O
the O
bunk-house O
, O
the NOM_PER
stranger NOM_PER
sprang O
out O
over O
the O
wheel O
with O
the O
agility O
which O
bespoke O
youthful O
muscles O
, O
and O
the NOM_PER
Old NOM_PER
Man NOM_PER
introduced O
him PRON_PER
with O
a O
quirk O
of O
the O
lips O
: O
" O
This O

" O
The O
Old O
Man O
drove O
on O
to O
the O
house O
with O
his O
own O
luggage O
, O
and O
Happy O
Jack O
followed O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
team O
; O
but O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
Happy O
Family O
unobtrusively O
took O
the O
measure O
of O
the O
foreign O
element O
. O
From O
his O
black-and-white O
horsehair O
hatband O
, O
with O
tassels O
that O
swept O
to O
the O
very O
edge O
of O
his O
gray O
hatbrim O
, O
to O
the O
crimson O
silk O
neckerchief O
draped O
over O
the O
pale O
blue O
bosom O
of O
his O
shirt O
; O
from O
the O
beautifully O
stamped O
leather O
cuffs O
, O
down O
to O
the O
exaggerated O
height O
of O
his O
tan O
boot-heels O
, O
their O
critical O
eyes O
swept O
in O
swift O
, O
appraising O
glances O
; O
and O
unanimous O
disapproval O
was O
the O
result O
. O
The O
Happy O
Family O
had O
themselves O
an O
eye O
to O
picturesque O
garb O
upon O
occasion O
, O
but O
this O
passed O
even O
Pink O
's O
love O
of O
display O
. O
" O
He O
's O
some O
gaudy O
to O
look O
at O
, O
" O
Irish O
murmured O
under O
his O
breath O
to O
Cal O
Emmett O
. O
" O
All O
he O
lacks O
is O
a O
spot-light O
and O
a O
brass O
band O
, O
" O
Cal O
returned O
, O
in O
much O
the O
same O
tone O
with O
which O
a O
woman O
remarks O
upon O
a O
last O
season O
's O
hat O
on O
the O
head O
of O
a O
rival O
. O
Miguel O
was O
not O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
inspection O
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
straight O
, O
and O
swarthily O
handsome O
, O
and O
he O
stood O
with O
the O
complacence O
of O
a O
stage O
favorite O
waiting O
for O
the O
applause O
to O
cease O
so O
that O
he O
might O
speak O
his O
first O
lines O
; O
and O
, O
while O
he O
waited O
, O
he O
sifted O
tobacco O
into O
a O
cigarette O
paper O
daintily O
, O
with O
his O
little O
finger O
extended O
. O
There O
was O
a O
ring O
upon O
that O
finger O
; O
a O
ring O
with O
a O
moonstone O
setting O
as O
large O
and O
round O
as O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
startled O
cat O
, O
and O
the O
Happy O
Family O
caught O
the O
pale O
gleam O
of O
it O
and O
drew O
a O
long O
breath O
. O
He O
lighted O
a O
match O
nonchalantly O
, O
by O
the O
artfully O
simple O
method O
of O
pinching O
the O
head O
of O
it O
with O
his O
fingernails O
, O
leaned O
negligently O
against O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
bunk-house O
, O
and O
regarded O
the O
group O
incuriously O
while O
he O
smoked O
. O
" O
Any O
pretty O
girls O
up O
this O
way O
? O
" O
he O
inquired O
languidly O
, O
after O
a O
moment O
, O
fanning O
a O
thin O
smoke-cloud O
from O
before O
his O
face O
while O
he O
spoke O
. O
The O
Happy O
Family O
went O
prickly O
hot O
. O
The O
girls O
in O
that O
neighborhood O
were O
held O
in O
esteem O
, O
and O
there O
was O
that O
in O
his O
tone O
which O
gave O
offense O
. O
" O
Sure O
, O
there O
's O
pretty O
girls O
here O
! O
" O
Big O
Medicine O
bellowed O
unexpectedly O
, O
close O
beside O
him O
. O
" O
We O
're O
all O
of O
us O
engaged O
to O
` O
em O
, O
by O
cripes O
! O
" O
Miguel O
shot O
an O
oblique O
glance O
at O
Big O
Medicine O
, O
examined O
the O
end O
of O
his O
cigarette O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
lift O
of O
shoulder O
, O
which O
might O
mean O
anything O
or O
nothing O
, O
and O
so O
was O
irritating O
to O
a O
degree O
. O
He O
did O
not O
pursue O
the O
subject O
further O
, O
and O
so O
several O
belated O
retorts O
were O
left O
tickling O
futilely O
the O
tongues O
of O
the O
Happy O
Family O
-- O
which O
does O
not O
make O
for O
amiability O
. O
To O
a O
man O
they O
liked O
him O
little O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
easy O
friendliness O
with O
mankind O
in O
general O
. O
At O
supper O
they O
talked O
with O
him O
perfunctorily O
, O
and O
covertly O
sneered O
because O
he O
sprinkled O
his O
food O
liberally O
with O
cayenne O
and O
his O
speech O
with O
Spanish O
words O
pronounced O
with O
soft O
, O
slurred O
vowels O
that O
made O
them O
sound O
unfamiliar O
, O
and O
against O
which O
his O
English O
contrasted O
sharply O
with O
its O
crisp O
, O
American O
enunciation O
. O
He O
met O
their O
infrequent O
glances O
with O
the O
cool O
stare O
of O
absolute O
indifference O
to O
their O
opinion O
of O
him O
, O
and O
their O
perfunctory O
civility O
with O
introspective O
calm O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
, O
when O
there O
was O
riding O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
Miguel O
appeared O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
in O
his O
working O
clothes O
, O
even O
Weary O
, O
the O
sunny-hearted O
, O
had O
an O
unmistakable O
curl O
of O
his O
lip O
after O
the O
first O
glance O
. O
Miguel O
wore O
the O
hatband O
, O
the O
crimson O
kerchief O
tied O
loosely O
with O
the O
point O
draped O
over O
his O
chest O
, O
the O
stamped O
leather O
cuffs O
and O
the O
tan O
boots O
with O
the O
highest O
heels O
ever O
built O
by O
the O
cobbler O
craft O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
him O
was O
incased O
in O
chaps O
the O
like O
of O
which O
had O
never O
before O
been O
brought O
into O
Flying O
U O
coulee O
. O
Black O
Angora O
chaps O
they O
were O
; O
long-haired O
, O
crinkly O
to O
the O
very O
hide O
, O
with O
three O
white O
, O
diamond-shaped O
patches O
running O
down O
each O
leg O
of O
them O
, O
and O
with O
the O
leather O
waistband O
stamped O
elaborately O
to O
match O
the O
cuffs O
. O
The O
bands O
of O
his O
spurs O
were O
two O
inches O
wide O
and O
inlaid O
to O
the O
edge O
with O
beaten O
silver O
, O
and O
each O
concho O
was O
engraved O
to O
represent O
a O
large O
, O
wild O
rose O
, O
with O
a O
golden O
center O
. O
A O
dollar O
laid O
upon O
the O
rowels O
would O
have O
left O
a O
fringe O
of O
prongs O
all O
around O
. O
He O
bent O
over O
his O
sacked O
riding O
outfit O
, O
and O
undid O
it O
, O
revealing O
a O
wonderful O
saddle O
of O
stamped O
leather O
inlaid O
on O
skirt O
and O
cantle O
with O
more O
beaten O
silver O
. O
He O
straightened O
the O
skirts O
, O
carefully O
ignoring O
the O
glances O
thrown O
in O
his O
direction O
, O
and O
swore O
softly O
to O
himself O
when O
he O
discovered O
where O
the O
leather O
had O
been O
scratched O
through O
the O
canvas O
wrappings O
and O
the O
end O
of O
the O
silver O
scroll O
ripped O
up O
. O
He O
drew O
out O
his O
bridle O
and O
shook O
it O
into O
shape O
, O
and O
the O
silver O
mountings O
and O
the O
reins O
of O
braided O
leather O
with O
horsehair O
tassels O
made O
Happy O
Jack O
's O
eyes O
greedy O
with O
desire O
. O
His O
blanket O
was O
a O
scarlet O
Navajo O
, O
and O
his O
rope O
a O
rawhide O
lariat O
. O
Altogether O
, O
his O
splendor O
when O
he O
was O
mounted O
so O
disturbed O
the O
fine O
mental O
poise O
of O
the O
Happy O
Family O
that O
they O
left O
him O
jingling O
richly O
off O
by O
himself O
, O
while O
they O
rode O
closely O
grouped O
and O
discussed O
him O
acrimoniously O
. O
" O
By O
gosh O
, O
a O
man O
might O
do O
worse O
than O
locate O
that O
Native O
Son O
for O
a O
silver O
mine O
, O
" O
Cal O
began O
, O
eyeing O
the O
interloper O
scornfully O
. O
" O
It O
's O
plumb O
wicked O
to O
ride O
around O
with O
all O
that O
wealth O
and O
fussy O
stuff O
. O
He O
must O
' O
a O
' O
robbed O
a O
bank O
and O
put O
the O
money O
all O
into O
a O
riding O
outfit O
. O
" O
" O
By O
golly O
, O
he O
looks O
to O
me O
like O
a O
pair O
uh O
trays O
when O
he O
comes O
bow-leggin O
' O
along O
with O
them O
white O
diamonds O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
" O
Slim O
stated O
solemnly O
. O
" O
And O
I O
'll O
gamble O
that O
's O
a O
spot O
higher O
than O
he O
stacks O
up O
in O
the O
cow O
game O
, O
" O
Pink O
observed O
with O
the O
pessimism O
which O
matrimony O
had O
given O
him O
. O
" O
You O
mind O
him O
asking O
about O
bad O
horses O
, O
last O
night O
? O
That O
Lizzie-boy O
never O
saw O
a O
bad O
horse O
; O
they O
do O
n't O
grow O
'em O
where O
he O
come O
from O
. O
What O
they O
do O

know O
about O

make O
up O
for O
with O
a O

" O
And O
, O
oh O
, O
mamma O
! O
It O
sure O
is O
a O

" O
Weary O
paid O
generous O
tribute O

" O
Only O
I O
will O
say O
old O
Banjo O
reminds O
me O
of O
an O
Irish O
cook O
rigged O
out O
in O
silk O
and O
diamonds O
. O
That O
outfit O
on O
Glory O
, O
now O

" O
He O
sighed O
enviously O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
've O
gone O
up O
against O
a O
few O
real O
ones O
in O
my O
long O
and O
varied O
career O
, O
" O
Irish O
remarked O
reminiscently O
, O
" O
and O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
a O
hoss O
never O
has O
any O
respect O
or O
admiration O
for O
a O
swell O
rig O

When O
he O
gets O

him O

cried O
Pink O
, O
with O
intense O
disgust O

" O

off O

the O

up O

everybody O
to O
it O
, O
like O
it O
was O
a O

And O
there O
'll O
be O
two O

three O
fellers O
to O
every O

all O
lit O
up O

they O

The O

at O
the O

that O
Miguel O
left O
his O

splendor O

swung O
over O
to O
them O
, O
ostensibly O
to O
borrow O
a O
match O

" O

up O

I O

him O
as O
if O
it O
were O
yesterday O
, O
as O
he O
came O
plodding O
to O
the O
inn O
door O
, O
his O
sea-chest O
following O
behind O
him O
in O
a O
hand-barrow O
-- O
a O
tall O
, O
strong O
, O
heavy O
, O
nut-brown O
man O
, O
his O
tarry O
pigtail O
falling O
over O

across O

a O
dirty O
, O
livid O
white O
. O
I O
remember O
him O
looking O
round O
the O
cover O
and O
whistling O
to O
himself O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
and O
then O
breaking O
out O
in O
that O
old O
sea-song O
that O
he O
sang O
so O
often O
afterwards O
: O
" O
Fifteen O
men O
on O
the O
dead O
man O

Yo-ho-ho O

a O
bottle O
of O

" O
in O
the O
high O

old O
tottering O
voice O
that O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
tuned O
and O
broken O
at O
the O
capstan O
bars O
. O
Then O
he O
rapped O
on O
the O
door O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
stick O
like O
a O
handspike O
that O
he O
carried O
, O
and O
when O
my O
father O
appeared O
, O
called O
roughly O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
rum O
. O
This O
, O
when O
it O
was O
brought O
to O
him O
, O
he O
drank O
slowly O
, O
like O
a O
connoisseur O
, O
lingering O
on O
the O
taste O
and O
still O
looking O
about O
him O
at O
the O
cliffs O
and O
up O
at O
our O
signboard O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O

at O
length O

more O

the O
pity O

up O

what O
you O

threw O
down O
three O

four O
gold O
pieces O
on O
the O
threshold O

can O
tell O
me O

he O
, O
looking O
as O
fierce O
as O
a O
commander O
. O
And O
indeed O
bad O
as O
his O
clothes O
were O
and O
coarsely O
as O
he O
spoke O

he O
had O
none O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
man O
who O
sailed O
before O
the O
mast O
, O
but O
seemed O
like O
a O
mate O

skipper O
accustomed O
to O
be O
obeyed O
or O
to O
strike O
. O
The O
man O
who O
came O
with O
the O
barrow O
told O
us O

set O
him O
down O
the O
morning O
before O

the O
Royal O
George O

that O

and O
hearing O
ours O
well O
spoken O
of O
, O
I O

described O
as O
lonely O

chosen O
it O
from O
the O

his O
place O

that O
was O
all O
we O
could O
learn O
of O
our O
guest O
. O
He O
was O
a O
very O
silent O
man O
by O
custom O
. O
All O
day O
he O
hung O
round O
the O
cove O
or O
upon O
the O
cliffs O
with O
a O
brass O
telescope O
; O
all O
evening O
he O
sat O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
parlour O
next O
the O
fire O
and O
drank O
rum O
and O
water O
very O
strong O
. O
Mostly O
he O
would O
not O
speak O
when O
spoken O
to O
, O
only O
look O
up O
sudden O
and O
fierce O
and O
blow O
through O
his O
nose O
like O
a O
fog-horn O
; O
and O
we O
and O
the O
people O
who O
came O
about O
our O
house O
soon O
learned O
to O
let O
him O
be O
. O
Every O
day O
when O
he O
came O
back O
from O
his O
stroll O
he O
would O
ask O
if O
any O
seafaring O
men O
had O
gone O
by O
along O
the O
road O
. O
At O
first O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
want O
of O
company O
of O
his O
own O
kind O
that O
made O
him O
ask O
this O
question O
, O
but O
at O
last O
we O
began O
to O
see O
he O
was O
desirous O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O
When O
a O
seaman O
did O
put O
up O
at O
the O
Admiral O
Benbow O
( O
as O
now O
and O
then O
some O
did O
, O
making O
by O
the O
coast O
road O
for O
Bristol O
) O
he O
would O
look O
in O
at O
him O
through O
the O
curtained O
door O
before O
he O
entered O
the O
parlour O
; O
and O
he O
was O
always O
sure O
to O
be O
as O
silent O
as O
a O
mouse O
when O
any O
such O
was O
present O
. O
For O
me O
, O
at O
least O
, O
there O
was O
no O
secret O
about O
the O
matter O
, O
for O
I O
was O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
a O
sharer O
in O
his O
alarms O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
me O
aside O
one O
day O
and O
promised O
me O
a O
silver O
fourpenny O
on O
the O
first O
of O
every O
month O
if O
I O
would O
only O
keep O
my O
" O
weather-eye O
open O
for O
a O
seafaring O
man O
with O
one O
leg O
" O
and O
let O
him O
know O
the O
moment O
he O
appeared O
. O
Often O
enough O
when O
the O
first O
of O
the O
month O
came O
round O
and O
I O
applied O
to O
him O
for O
my O
wage O
, O
he O
would O
only O
blow O
through O
his O
nose O
at O
me O
and O
stare O
me O
down O
, O
but O
before O
the O
week O
was O
out O
he O
was O
sure O
to O
think O
better O
of O
it O
, O
bring O
me O
my O
four-penny O
piece O
, O
and O
repeat O
his O
orders O
to O
look O
out O
for O
" O
the O
seafaring O
man O
with O
one O
leg O
. O
" O
How O
that O
personage O
haunted O
my O
dreams O
, O
I O
need O
scarcely O
tell O
you O
. O
On O
stormy O
nights O
, O
when O
the O
wind O
shook O
the O
four O
corners O
of O
the O
house O
and O
the O
surf O
roared O
along O
the O
cove O
and O
up O
the O
cliffs O
, O
I O
would O
see O
him O
in O
a O
thousand O
forms O
, O
and O
with O
a O
thousand O
diabolical O
expressions O
. O
Now O
the O
leg O
would O
be O
cut O
off O
at O
the O
knee O
, O
now O
at O
the O
hip O
; O
now O
he O
was O
a O
monstrous O
kind O
of O
a O
creature O
who O
had O
never O
had O
but O
the O
one O
leg O
, O
and O
that O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
his O
body O
. O
To O
see O
him O
leap O
and O
run O
and O
pursue O
me O
over O
hedge O
and O
ditch O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
nightmares O
. O
And O
altogether O
I O
paid O
pretty O
dear O
for O
my O
monthly O
fourpenny O
piece O
, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
these O
abominable O
fancies O
. O
But O
though O
I O
was O
so O
terrified O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
seafaring O
man O
with O
one O
leg O
, O
I O
was O
far O
less O
afraid O
of O
the O
captain O
himself O
than O
anybody O
else O
who O
knew O
him O
. O
There O
were O
nights O
when O
he O
took O
a O
deal O
more O
rum O
and O
water O
than O
his O
head O
would O
carry O
; O
and O
then O
he O
would O
sometimes O
sit O
and O
sing O
his O
wicked O
, O
old O
, O
wild O
sea-songs O
, O
minding O
nobody O
; O
but O
sometimes O
he O
would O
call O
for O
glasses O
round O
and O
force O
all O
the O
trembling O
company O
to O
listen O
to O
his O
stories O
or O
bear O
a O
chorus O
to O
his O
singing O
. O
Often O
I O
have O
heard O
the O
house O
shaking O
with O
" O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
, O
" O
all O
the O
neighbours O
joining O
in O
for O
dear O
life O
, O
with O
the O
fear O
of O
death O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
each O
singing O
louder O
than O
the O
other O
to O
avoid O
remark O
. O
For O
in O
these O
fits O
he O
was O
the O
most O
overriding O
companion O
ever O
known O
; O
he O
would O
slap O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
table O
for O
silence O
all O
round O
; O
he O
would O
fly O
up O
in O
a O
passion O
of O
anger O
at O
a O
question O
, O
or O
sometimes O
because O
none O
was O
put O
, O
and O
so O
he O
judged O
the O
company O
was O
not O
following O
his O
story O
. O
Nor O
would O
he O
allow O
anyone O
to O
leave O
the O
inn O
till O
he O
had O
drunk O
himself O
sleepy O
and O
reeled O
off O
to O
bed O
. O
His O
stories O
were O
what O
frightened O
people O
worst O
of O
all O
. O
Dreadful O
stories O
they O
were O
-- O
about O
hanging O
, O
and O
walking O
the O
plank O
, O
and O
storms O
at O
sea O
, O
and O
the O
Dry O
Tortugas O
, O
and O
wild O
deeds O
and O
places O
on O
the O
Spanish O
Main O
. O
By O
his O
own O
account O
he O
must O
have O
lived O
his O
life O
among O
some O
of O
the O
wickedest O
men O
that O
God O
ever O
allowed O
upon O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
the O
language O
in O
which O
he O
told O
these O
stories O
shocked O
our O
plain O
country O
people O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
the O
crimes O
that O
he O
described O
. O
My O
father O
was O
always O
saying O
the O
inn O
would O
be O
ruined O
, O
for O
people O
would O
soon O
cease O
coming O
there O
to O
be O
tyrannized O
over O
and O
put O
down O
, O
and O
sent O
shivering O
to O
their O
beds O
; O
but O
I O
really O
believe O
his O
presence O
did O
us O
good O
. O
People O
were O
frightened O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
on O
looking O
back O
they O
rather O
liked O
it O
; O
it O
was O
a O
fine O
excitement O
in O
a O
quiet O
country O
life O
, O
and O
there O
was O
even O
a O
party O
of O
the O
younger O
men O
who O
pretended O
to O
admire O
him O
, O
calling O
him O
a O
" O
true O
sea-dog O
" O
and O
a O
" O
real O
old O
salt O
" O
and O
such O
like O
names O
, O
and O
saying O
there O
was O
the O
sort O
of O
man O
that O
made O
England O
terrible O
at O
sea O
. O
In O
one O
way O
, O
indeed O
, O
he O
bade O
fair O
to O
ruin O
us O
, O
for O
he O
kept O
on O
staying O
week O
after O
week O
, O
and O
at O
last O
month O
after O
month O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
money O
had O
been O
long O
exhausted O
, O
and O
still O
my O
father O
never O
plucked O
up O
the O
heart O
to O
insist O
on O
having O
more O
. O
If O
ever O
he O
mentioned O
it O
, O
the O
captain O
blew O
through O
his O
nose O
so O
loudly O
that O
you O
might O
say O
he O
roared O
, O
and O
stared O
my O
poor O
father O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
wringing O
his O
hands O
after O
such O
a O
rebuff O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
the O
annoyance O
and O
the O
terror O
he O
lived O
in O
must O
have O
greatly O
hastened O
his O
early O
and O
unhappy O
death O
. O
All O
the O
time O
he O
lived O
with O
us O
the O
captain O
made O
no O
change O
whatever O
in O
his O
dress O
but O
to O
buy O
some O
stockings O
from O
a O
hawker O
. O
One O
of O
the O
cocks O
of O
his O
hat O
having O
fallen O
down O
, O
he O
let O
it O
hang O
from O
that O
day O
forth O
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
great O
annoyance O
when O
it O
blew O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
which O
he O
patched O
himself O
upstairs O
in O
his O
room O
, O
and O
which O
, O
before O
the O
end O
, O
was O
nothing O
but O
patches O
. O
He O
never O
wrote O
or O
received O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
he O
never O
spoke O
with O
any O
but O
the O
neighbours O
, O
and O
with O
these O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
only O
when O
drunk O
on O
rum O
. O
The O
great O
sea-chest O
none O
of O
us O
had O
ever O
seen O
open O
. O
He O
was O
only O
once O
crossed O
, O
and O
that O
was O
towards O
the O
end O
, O
when O
my O
poor O
father O
was O
far O
gone O
in O
a O
decline O
that O
took O
him O
off O
. O
Dr. O
Livesey O
came O
late O
one O
afternoon O
to O
see O
the O
patient O
, O
took O
a O
bit O
of O
dinner O
from O
my O
mother O
, O
and O
went O
into O
the O
parlour O
to O
smoke O
a O
pipe O
until O
his O
horse O
should O
come O
down O
from O
the O
hamlet O
, O
for O
we O
had O
no O
stabling O
at O
the O
old O
Benbow O
. O
I O
followed O
him O
in O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
observing O
the O
contrast O
the O
neat O
, O
bright O
doctor O
, O
with O
his O
powder O
as O
white O
as O
snow O
and O
his O
bright O
, O
black O
eyes O
and O
pleasant O
manners O
, O
made O
with O
the O
coltish O
country O
folk O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
with O
that O
filthy O
, O
heavy O
, O
bleared O
scarecrow O
of O
a O
pirate O
of O
ours O
, O
sitting O
, O
far O
gone O
in O
rum O
, O
with O
his O
arms O
on O
the O
table O
. O
Suddenly O
he O
-- O
the O
captain O
, O
that O
is O
-- O
began O
to O
pipe O
up O
his O
eternal O
song O
: O
" O
Fifteen O
men O
on O
the O
dead O
man O
's O
chest O
-- O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
! O
Drink O
and O
the O
devil O
had O
done O
for O
the O
rest O
-- O
Yo-ho-ho O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
rum O
! O
" O
At O
first O
I O
had O
supposed O
" O
the O
dead O
man O
's O
chest O
" O
to O
be O
that O
identical O
big O
box O
of O
his O
upstairs O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
and O
the O
thought O
had O
been O
mingled O
in O
my O
nightmares O
with O
that O
of O
the O
one-legged O
seafaring O
man O
. O
But O
by O
this O
time O
we O
had O
all O
long O
ceased O
to O
pay O
any O
particular O
notice O
to O
the O
song O
; O
it O
was O
new O
, O
that O
night O
, O
to O
nobody O
but O
Dr. O
Livesey O
, O
and O
on O
him O
I O
observed O
it O
did O
not O
produce O
an O
agreeable O
effect O
, O
for O
he O
looked O
up O
for O
a O
moment O
quite O
angrily O
before O
he O
went O
on O
with O
his O
talk O
to O
old O
Taylor O
, O
the O
gardener O
, O
on O
a O
new O
cure O
for O
the O
rheumatics O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
captain O
gradually O
brightened O
up O
at O
his O
own O
music O
, O
and O
at O
last O
flapped O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
table O
before O
him O
in O
a O
way O
we O
all O
knew O
to O
mean O
silence O
. O
The O
voices O
stopped O
at O
once O
, O
all O
but O
Dr. O
Livesey O
's O
; O
he O
went O
on O
as O
before O
speaking O
clear O
and O
kind O
and O
drawing O
briskly O
at O
his O
pipe O
between O
every O
word O
or O
two O
. O
The O
captain O
glared O
at O
him O
for O
a O
while O
, O
flapped O
his O
hand O
again O
, O
glared O
still O
harder O
, O
and O
at O
last O
broke O
out O
with O
a O
villainous O
, O
low O
oath O
, O
" O
Silence O
, O
there O
, O
between O
decks O

CHAPTER O
I O
It O
was O
a O
Sunday O
evening O
in O
October O
, O
and O
in O
common O
with O
many NOM_PER
other NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
ladies NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
her NOM_PER
class NOM_PER
, O
Katharine O
Hilbery O
was O
pouring O
out O
tea O
. O
Perhaps O
a O
fifth O
part O
of O
her O
mind O
was O
thus O
occupied O
, O
and O
the O
remaining O
parts O
leapt O
over O
the O
little O
barrier O
of O
day O
which O
interposed O
between O
Monday O
morning O
and O
this O
rather O
subdued O
moment O
, O
and O
played O
with O
the O
things O
one O
does O
voluntarily O
and O
normally O
in O
the O
daylight O
. O
But O
although O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
she O
was O
evidently O
mistress O
of O
a O
situation O
which O
was O
familiar O
enough O
to O
her O
, O
and O
inclined O
to O
let O
it O
take O
its O
way O
for O
the O
six O
hundredth O
time O
, O
perhaps O
, O
without O
bringing O
into O
play O
any O
of O
her O
unoccupied O
faculties O
. O
A O
single O
glance O
was O
enough O
to O
show O
that O
Mrs. O
Hilbery O
was O
so O
rich O
in O
the O
gifts O
which O
make O
tea-parties O
of O
elderly O
distinguished O
people O
successful O
, O
that O
she O
scarcely O
needed O
any O
help O
from O
her O
daughter O
, O
provided O
that O
the O
tiresome O
business O
of O
teacups O
and O
bread O
and O
butter O
was O
discharged O
for O
her O
. O
Considering O
that O
the O
little O
party O
had O
been O
seated O
round O
the O
tea-table O
for O
less O
than O
twenty O
minutes O
, O
the O
animation O
observable O
on O
their O
faces O
, O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
sound O
they O
were O
producing O
collectively O
, O
were O
very O
creditable O
to O
the O
hostess O
. O
It O
suddenly O
came O
into O
Katharine O
’s O
mind O
that O
if O
some O
one O
opened O
the O
door O
at O
this O
moment O
he O
would O
think O
that O
they O
were O
enjoying O
themselves O
; O
he O
would O
think O
, O
" O
What O
an O
extremely O
nice O
house O
to O
come O
into O
! O
" O
and O
instinctively O
she O
laughed O
, O
and O
said O
something O
to O
increase O
the O
noise O
, O
for O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
house O
presumably O
, O
since O
she O
herself O
had O
not O
been O
feeling O
exhilarated O
. O
At O
the O
very O
same O
moment O
, O
rather O
to O
her O
amusement O
, O
the O
door O
was O
flung O
open O
, O
and O
a O
young O
man O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
Katharine O
, O
as O
she O
shook O
hands O
with O
him O
, O
asked O
him O
, O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
do O
you O
think O
we O
’re O
enjoying O
ourselves O
enormously O
? O
" O
... O
" O
Mr. O
Denham O
, O
mother O
, O
" O
she O
said O
aloud O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
her O
mother O
had O
forgotten O
his O
name O
. O
That O
fact O
was O
perceptible O
to O
Mr. O
Denham O
also O
, O
and O
increased O
the O
awkwardness O
which O
inevitably O
attends O
the O
entrance O
of O
a O
stranger O
into O
a O
room O
full O
of O
people O
much O
at O
their O
ease O
, O
and O
all O
launched O
upon O
sentences O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
Mr. O
Denham O
as O
if O
a O
thousand O
softly O
padded O
doors O
had O
closed O
between O
him O
and O
the O
street O
outside O
. O
A O
fine O
mist O
, O
the O
etherealized O
essence O
of O
the O
fog O
, O
hung O
visibly O
in O
the O
wide O
and O
rather O
empty O
space O
of O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
all O
silver O
where O
the O
candles O
were O
grouped O
on O
the O
tea-table O
, O
and O
ruddy O
again O
in O
the O
firelight O
. O
With O
the O
omnibuses O
and O
cabs O
still O
running O
in O
his O
head O
, O
and O
his O
body O
still O
tingling O
with O
his O
quick O
walk O
along O
the O
streets O
and O
in O
and O
out O
of O
traffic O
and O
foot-passengers O
, O
this O
drawing-room O
seemed O
very O
remote O
and O
still O
; O
and O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
elderly O
people O
were O
mellowed O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
had O
a O
bloom O
on O
them O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
air O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
was O
thickened O
by O
blue O
grains O
of O
mist O
. O
Mr. O
Denham O
had O
come O
in O
as O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
, O
the O
eminent O
novelist O
, O
reached O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
very O
long O
sentence O
. O
He O
kept O
this O
suspended O
while O
the O
newcomer O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hilbery O
deftly O
joined O
the O
severed O
parts O
by O
leaning O
towards O
him O
and O
remarking O
: O
" O
Now O
, O
what O
would O
you O
do O
if O
you O
were O
married O
to O
an O
engineer O
, O
and O
had O
to O
live O
in O
Manchester O
, O
Mr. O
Denham O
? O
" O
" O
Surely O
she O
could O
learn O
Persian O
, O
" O
broke O
in O
a O
thin O
, O
elderly O
gentleman O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
retired O
schoolmaster O
or O
man O
of O
letters O
in O
Manchester O
with O
whom O
she O
could O
read O
Persian O
? O
" O
" O
A O
cousin O
of O
ours O
has O
married O
and O
gone O
to O
live O
in O
Manchester O
, O
" O
Katharine O
explained O
. O
Mr. O
Denham O
muttered O
something O
, O
which O
was O
indeed O
all O
that O
was O
required O
of O
him O
, O
and O
the O
novelist O
went O
on O
where O
he O
had O
left O
off O
. O
Privately O
, O
Mr. O
Denham O
cursed O
himself O
very O
sharply O
for O
having O
exchanged O
the O
freedom O
of O
the O
street O
for O
this O
sophisticated O
drawing-room O
, O
where O
, O
among O
other O
disagreeables O
, O
he O
certainly O
would O
not O
appear O
at O
his O
best O
. O
He O
glanced O
round O
him O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
, O
save O
for O
Katharine O
, O
they O
were O
all O
over O
forty O
, O
the O
only O
consolation O
being O
that O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
was O
a O
considerable O
celebrity O
, O
so O
that O
to-morrow O
one O
might O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
met O
him O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
ever O
been O
to O
Manchester O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
Katharine O
. O
" O
Never O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
. O
" O
Why O
do O
you O
object O
to O
it O
, O
then O
? O
" O
Katharine O
stirred O
her O
tea O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
speculate O
, O
so O
Denham O
thought O
, O
upon O
the O
duty O
of O
filling O
somebody O
else O
’s O
cup O
, O
but O
she O
was O
really O
wondering O
how O
she O
was O
going O
to O
keep O
this O
strange O
young O
man O
in O
harmony O
with O
the O
rest O
. O
She O
observed O
that O
he O
was O
compressing O
his O
teacup O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
danger O
lest O
the O
thin O
china O
might O
cave O
inwards O
. O
She O
could O
see O
that O
he O
was O
nervous O
; O
one O
would O
expect O
a O
bony O
young O
man O
with O
his O
face O
slightly O
reddened O
by O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
his O
hair O
not O
altogether O
smooth O
, O
to O
be O
nervous O
in O
such O
a O
party O
. O
Further O
, O
he O
probably O
disliked O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
and O
had O
come O
out O
of O
curiosity O
, O
or O
because O
her O
father O
had O
invited O
him O
-- O
anyhow O
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
easily O
combined O
with O
the O
rest O
. O
" O
I O
should O
think O
there O
would O
be O
no O
one O
to O
talk O
to O
in O
Manchester O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
at O
random O
. O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
had O
been O
observing O
her O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
, O
as O
novelists O
are O
inclined O
to O
observe O
, O
and O
at O
this O
remark O
he O
smiled O
, O
and O
made O
it O
the O
text O
for O
a O
little O
further O
speculation O
. O
" O
In O
spite O
of O
a O
slight O
tendency O
to O
exaggeration O
, O
Katharine O
decidedly O
hits O
the O
mark O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
and O
lying O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
, O
with O
his O
opaque O
contemplative O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
ceiling O
, O
and O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
fingers O
pressed O
together O
, O
he O
depicted O
, O
first O
the O
horrors O
of O
the O
streets O
of O
Manchester O
, O
and O
then O
the O
bare O
, O
immense O
moors O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
town O
, O
and O
then O
the O
scrubby O
little O
house O
in O
which O
the O
girl O
would O
live O
, O
and O
then O
the O
professors O
and O
the O
miserable O
young O
students O
devoted O
to O
the O
more O
strenuous O
works O
of O
our O
younger O
dramatists O
, O
who O
would O
visit O
her O
, O
and O
how O
her O
appearance O
would O
change O
by O
degrees O
, O
and O
how O
she O
would O
fly O
to O
London O
, O
and O
how O
Katharine O
would O
have O
to O
lead O
her O
about O
, O
as O
one O
leads O
an O
eager O
dog O
on O
a O
chain O
, O
past O
rows O
of O
clamorous O
butchers O
’ O
shops O
, O
poor O
dear O
creature O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Hilbery O
, O
as O
he O
finished O
, O
" O
I O
had O
just O
written O
to O
say O
how O
I O
envied O
her O
! O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
the O
big O
gardens O
and O
the O
dear O
old O
ladies O
in O
mittens O
, O
who O
read O
nothing O
but O
the O
" O
Spectator O
, O
" O
and O
snuff O
the O
candles O
. O
Have O
they O
ALL O
disappeared O
? O
I O
told O
her O
she O
would O
find O
the O
nice O
things O
of O
London O
without O
the O
horrid O
streets O
that O
depress O
one O
so O
. O
" O
" O
There O
is O
the O
University O
, O
" O
said O
the O
thin O
gentleman O
, O
who O
had O
previously O
insisted O
upon O
the O
existence O
of O
people O
knowing O
Persian O
. O
" O
I O
know O
there O
are O
moors O
there O
, O
because O
I O
read O
about O
them O
in O
a O
book O
the O
other O
day O
, O
" O
said O
Katharine O
. O
" O
I O
am O
grieved O
and O
amazed O
at O
the O
ignorance O
of O
my O
family O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Hilbery O
remarked O
. O
He O
was O
an O
elderly O
man O
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
oval O
, O
hazel O
eyes O
which O
were O
rather O
bright O
for O
his O
time O
of O
life O
, O
and O
relieved O
the O
heaviness O
of O
his O
face O
. O
He O
played O
constantly O
with O
a O
little O
green O
stone O
attached O
to O
his O
watch-chain O
, O
thus O
displaying O
long O
and O
very O
sensitive O
fingers O
, O
and O
had O
a O
habit O
of O
moving O
his O
head O
hither O
and O
thither O
very O
quickly O
without O
altering O
the O
position O
of O
his O
large O
and O
rather O
corpulent O
body O
, O
so O
that O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
providing O
himself O
incessantly O
with O
food O
for O
amusement O
and O
reflection O
with O
the O
least O
possible O
expenditure O
of O
energy O
. O
One O
might O
suppose O
that O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
time O
of O
life O
when O
his O
ambitions O
were O
personal O
, O
or O
that O
he O
had O
gratified O
them O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
likely O
to O
do O
, O
and O
now O
employed O
his O
considerable O
acuteness O
rather O
to O
observe O
and O
reflect O
than O
to O
attain O
any O
result O
. O
Katharine O
, O
so O
Denham O
decided O
, O
while O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
built O
up O
another O
rounded O
structure O
of O
words O
, O
had O
a O
likeness O
to O
each O
of O
her O
parents O
, O
but O
these O
elements O
were O
rather O
oddly O
blended O
. O
She O
had O
the O
quick O
, O
impulsive O
movements O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
the O
lips O
parting O
often O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
closing O
again O
; O
and O
the O
dark O
oval O
eyes O
of O
her O
father O
brimming O
with O
light O
upon O
a O
basis O
of O
sadness O
, O
or O
, O
since O
she O
was O
too O
young O
to O
have O
acquired O
a O
sorrowful O
point O
of O
view O
, O
one O
might O
say O
that O
the O
basis O
was O
not O
sadness O
so O
much O
as O
a O
spirit O
given O
to O
contemplation O
and O
self-control O
. O
Judging O
by O
her O
hair O
, O
her O
coloring O
, O
and O
the O
shape O
of O
her O
features O
, O
she O
was O
striking O
, O
if O
not O
actually O
beautiful O
. O
Decision O
and O
composure O
stamped O
her O
, O
a O
combination O
of O
qualities O
that O
produced O
a O
very O
marked O
character O
, O
and O
one O
that O
was O
not O
calculated O
to O
put O
a O
young O
man O
, O
who O
scarcely O
knew O
her O
, O
at O
his O
ease O
. O
For O
the O
rest O
, O
she O
was O
tall O
; O
her O
dress O
was O
of O
some O
quiet O
color O
, O
with O
old O
yellow-tinted O
lace O
for O
ornament O
, O
to O
which O
the O
spark O
of O
an O
ancient O
jewel O
gave O
its O
one O
red O
gleam O
. O
Denham O
noticed O
that O
, O
although O
silent O
, O
she O
kept O
sufficient O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
to O
answer O
immediately O
her O
mother O
appealed O
to O
her O
for O
help O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
was O
obvious O
to O
him O
that O
she O
attended O
only O
with O
the O
surface O
skin O
of O
her O
mind O
. O
It O
struck O
him O
that O
her O
position O
at O
the O
tea-table O
, O
among O
all O
these O
elderly O
people O
, O
was O
not O
without O
its O
difficulties O
, O
and O
he O
checked O
his O
inclination O
to O
find O
her O
, O
or O
her O
attitude O
, O
generally O
antipathetic O
to O
him O
. O
The O
talk O
had O
passed O
over O
Manchester O
, O
after O
dealing O
with O
it O
very O
generously O
. O
" O
Would O
it O
be O
the O
Battle O
of O
Trafalgar O
or O
the O
Spanish O
Armada O
, O
Katharine O
? O
" O
her O
mother O
demanded O
. O
" O
Trafalgar O
, O
mother O
. O
" O
" O
Trafalgar O
, O
of O
course O
! O
How O
stupid O
of O
me O
! O
Another O
cup O
of O
tea O
, O
with O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
lemon O
in O
it O
, O
and O
then O
, O
dear O
Mr. O
Fortescue O
, O
please O
explain O
my O
absurd O
little O
puzzle O
. O
One O
ca O
n’t O
help O
believing O
gentlemen O
with O
Roman O
noses O
, O
even O
if O
one O
meets O
them O
in O
omnibuses O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Hilbery O
here O
interposed O
so O
far O
as O
Denham O
was O
concerned O
, O
and O
talked O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
sense O
about O
the O
solicitors O
’ O
profession O
, O
and O
the O
changes O
which O
he O
had O
seen O
in O
his O
lifetime O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Denham O
properly O
fell O
to O
his O
lot O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
an O
article O
by O
Denham O
upon O
some O
legal O
matter O
, O
published O
by O
Mr. O
Hilbery O
in O
his O
Review O
, O
had O
brought O
them O
acquainted O
. O
But O
when O
a O
moment O
later O
Mrs. O
Sutton O
Bailey O
was O
announced O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
her O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Denham O
found O
himself O
sitting O
silent O
, O
rejecting O
possible O
things O
to O
say O
, O
beside O
Katharine O
, O
who O
was O
silent O
too O
. O
Being O
much O
about O
the O
same O
age O
and O
both O
under O
thirty O
, O
they O
were O
prohibited O
from O
the O
use O
of O
a O
great O
many O
convenient O
phrases O
which O
launch O
conversation O
into O
smooth O
waters O
. O
They O
were O
further O
silenced O
by O
Katharine O
’s O
rather O
malicious O
determination O
not O
to O
help O
this O
young O
man O
, O
in O
whose O
upright O
and O
resolute O
bearing O
she O
detected O
something O
hostile O
to O
her O
surroundings O
, O
by O
any O
of O
the O
usual O
feminine O
amenities O
. O
They O
therefore O
sat O
silent O
, O
Denham O
controlling O
his O
desire O
to O
say O
something O
abrupt O
and O
explosive O
, O
which O
should O
shock O
her O
into O
life O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Hilbery O
was O
immediately O
sensitive O
to O
any O
silence O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
as O
of O
a O
dumb O
note O
in O
a O
sonorous O
scale O
, O
and O
leaning O
across O
the O
table O
she O
observed O
, O
in O
the O
curiously O
tentative O
detached O
manner O
which O
always O
gave O
her O
phrases O
the O
likeness O
of O
butterflies O
flaunting O
from O
one O
sunny O
spot O
to O
another O
, O
" O
D’you O
know O
, O
Mr. O
Denham O
, O
you O
remind O
me O
so O
much O
of O
dear O
Mr. O
Ruskin O

Is O
it O
his O
tie O

Katharine O
, O
or O
his O
hair O

the O
way O

sits O
in O
his O
chair O

Do O
tell O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Denham O
, O
are O
you O
an O
admirer O
of O
Ruskin O
? O
Some O
one O
, O
the O
other O
day O

said O
to O

CHAPTER O
I O
There O
was O
no O
possibility O
of O
taking O
a O
walk O
that O
day O
. O
We PRON_PER
had O
been O
wandering O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
the O
leafless O
shrubbery O
an O
hour O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
but O
since O
dinner O
( O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Reed PROP_PER
, O
when O
there O
was O
no NOM_PER
company NOM_PER
, O
dined O
early O
) O
the O
cold O
winter O
wind O
had O
brought O
with O
it O
clouds O
so O
sombre O
, O
and O
a O
rain O
so O
penetrating O
, O
that O
further O
out-door O
exercise O
was O
now O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
I PRON_PER
was O
glad O
of O
it O
: O
I PRON_PER
never O
liked O
long O
walks O
, O
especially O
on O
chilly O
afternoons O
: O
dreadful O
to O
me PRON_PER
was O
the O
coming O
home O
in O
the O
raw O
twilight O
, O
with O
nipped O
fingers O
and O
toes O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
saddened O
by O
the O
chidings O
of O
Bessie PROP_PER
, O
the NOM_PER
nurse NOM_PER
, O
and O
humbled O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
my PRON_PER
physical O
inferiority O
to O
Eliza PROP_PER
, O
John PROP_PER
, O
and O
Georgiana PROP_PER
Reed PROP_PER
. O
The O
said O
Eliza PROP_PER
, O
John PROP_PER
, O
and O
Georgiana PROP_PER
were O
now O
clustered O
round O
their NOM_PER
mama NOM_PER
in O
the O
drawing-room O
: O
she O
lay O
reclined O
on O
a O
sofa O
by O
the O
fireside O
, O
and O
with O
her O
darlings O
about O
her O
( O
for O
the O
time O
neither O
quarrelling O
nor O
crying O
) O
looked O
perfectly O
happy O
. O
Me O
, O
she O
had O
dispensed O
from O
joining O
the O
group O
; O
saying O
, O
" O
She O
regretted O
to O
be O
under O
the O
necessity O
of O
keeping O
me O
at O
a O
distance O
; O
but O
that O
until O
she O
heard O
from O
Bessie O
, O
and O
could O
discover O
by O
her O
own O
observation O
, O
that O
I O
was O
endeavouring O
in O
good O
earnest O
to O
acquire O
a O
more O
sociable O
and O
childlike O
disposition O
, O
a O
more O
attractive O
and O
sprightly O
manner O
-- O
something O
lighter O
, O
franker O
, O
more O
natural O
, O
as O
it O
were O
-- O
she O
really O
must O
exclude O
me O
from O
privileges O
intended O
only O
for O
contented O
, O
happy O
, O
little O
children O
. O
" O
" O
What O
does O
Bessie O
say O
I O
have O
done O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
. O
" O
Jane O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
cavillers O
or O
questioners O
; O
besides O
, O
there O
is O
something O
truly O
forbidding O
in O
a O
child O
taking O
up O
her O
elders O
in O
that O
manner O
. O
Be O
seated O
somewhere O
; O
and O
until O
you O
can O
speak O
pleasantly O
, O
remain O
silent O
. O
" O
A O
breakfast-room O
adjoined O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
I O
slipped O
in O
there O
. O
It O
contained O
a O
bookcase O
: O
I O
soon O
possessed O
myself O
of O
a O
volume O
, O
taking O
care O
that O
it O
should O
be O
one O
stored O
with O
pictures O
. O
I O
mounted O
into O
the O
window O
- O
seat O
: O
gathering O
up O
my O
feet O
, O
I O
sat O
cross-legged O
, O
like O
a O
Turk O
; O
and O
, O
having O
drawn O
the O
red O
moreen O
curtain O
nearly O
close O
, O
I O
was O
shrined O
in O
double O
retirement O
. O
Folds O
of O
scarlet O
drapery O
shut O
in O
my O
view O
to O
the O
right O
hand O
; O
to O
the O
left O
were O
the O
clear O
panes O
of O
glass O
, O
protecting O
, O
but O
not O
separating O
me O
from O
the O
drear O
November O
day O
. O
At O
intervals O
, O
while O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
my O
book O
, O
I O
studied O
the O
aspect O
of O
that O
winter O
afternoon O
. O
Afar O
, O
it O
offered O
a O
pale O
blank O
of O
mist O
and O
cloud O
; O
near O
a O
scene O
of O
wet O
lawn O
and O
storm-beat O
shrub O
, O
with O
ceaseless O
rain O
sweeping O
away O
wildly O
before O
a O
long O
and O
lamentable O
blast O
. O
I O
returned O
to O
my O
book O
-- O
Bewick O
's O
History O
of O
British O
Birds O
: O
the O
letterpress O
thereof O
I O
cared O
little O
for O
, O
generally O
speaking O
; O
and O
yet O
there O
were O
certain O
introductory O
pages O
that O
, O
child O
as O
I O
was O
, O
I O
could O
not O
pass O
quite O
as O
a O
blank O
. O
They O
were O
those O
which O
treat O
of O
the O
haunts O
of O
sea-fowl O
; O
of O
" O
the O
solitary O
rocks O
and O
promontories O
" O
by O
them O
only O
inhabited O
; O
of O
the O
coast O
of O
Norway O
, O
studded O
with O
isles O
from O
its O
southern O
extremity O
, O
the O
Lindeness O
, O
or O
Naze O
, O
to O
the O
North O
Cape O
-- O
" O
Where O
the O
Northern O
Ocean O
, O
in O
vast O
whirls O
, O
Boils O
round O
the O
naked O
, O
melancholy O
isles O
Of O
farthest O
Thule O
; O
and O
the O
Atlantic O
surge O
Pours O
in O
among O
the O
stormy O
Hebrides O
. O
" O
Nor O
could O
I O
pass O
unnoticed O
the O
suggestion O
of O
the O
bleak O
shores O
of O
Lapland O
, O
Siberia O
, O
Spitzbergen O
, O
Nova O
Zembla O
, O
Iceland O
, O
Greenland O
, O
with O
" O
the O
vast O
sweep O
of O
the O
Arctic O
Zone O
, O
and O
those O
forlorn O
regions O
of O
dreary O
space O
, O
-- O
that O
reservoir O
of O
frost O
and O
snow O
, O
where O
firm O
fields O
of O
ice O
, O
the O
accumulation O
of O
centuries O
of O
winters O
, O
glazed O
in O
Alpine O
heights O
above O
heights O
, O
surround O
the O
pole O
, O
and O
concentre O
the O
multiplied O
rigours O
of O
extreme O
cold O
. O
" O
Of O
these O
death-white O
realms O
I O
formed O
an O
idea O
of O
my O
own O
: O
shadowy O
, O
like O
all O
the O
half-comprehended O
notions O
that O
float O
dim O
through O
children O
's O
brains O
, O
but O
strangely O
impressive O
. O
The O
words O
in O
these O
introductory O
pages O
connected O
themselves O
with O
the O
succeeding O
vignettes O
, O
and O
gave O
significance O
to O
the O
rock O
standing O
up O
alone O
in O
a O
sea O
of O
billow O
and O
spray O
; O
to O
the O
broken O
boat O
stranded O
on O
a O
desolate O
coast O
; O
to O
the O
cold O
and O
ghastly O
moon O
glancing O
through O
bars O
of O
cloud O
at O
a O
wreck O
just O
sinking O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
what O
sentiment O
haunted O
the O
quite O
solitary O
churchyard O
, O
with O
its O
inscribed O
headstone O
; O
its O
gate O
, O
its O
two O
trees O
, O
its O
low O
horizon O
, O
girdled O
by O
a O
broken O
wall O
, O
and O
its O
newly-risen O
crescent O
, O
attesting O
the O
hour O
of O
eventide O
. O
The O
two O
ships O
becalmed O
on O
a O
torpid O
sea O
, O
I O
believed O
to O
be O
marine O
phantoms O
. O
The O
fiend O
pinning O
down O
the O
thief O
's O
pack O
behind O
him O
, O
I O
passed O
over O
quickly O
: O
it O
was O
an O
object O
of O
terror O
. O
So O
was O
the O
black O
horned O
thing O
seated O
aloof O
on O
a O
rock O
, O
surveying O
a O
distant O
crowd O
surrounding O
a O
gallows O
. O
Each O
picture O
told O
a O
story O
; O
mysterious O
often O
to O
my O
undeveloped O
understanding O
and O
imperfect O
feelings O
, O
yet O
ever O
profoundly O
interesting O
: O
as O
interesting O
as O
the O
tales O
Bessie O
sometimes O
narrated O
on O
winter O
evenings O
, O
when O
she O
chanced O
to O
be O
in O
good O
humour O
; O
and O
when O
, O
having O
brought O
her O
ironing-table O
to O
the O
nursery O
hearth O
, O
she O
allowed O
us O
to O
sit O
about O
it O
, O
and O
while O
she O
got O
up O
Mrs. O
Reed O
's O
lace O
frills O
, O
and O
crimped O
her O
nightcap O
borders O
, O
fed O
our O
eager O
attention O
with O
passages O
of O
love O
and O
adventure O
taken O
from O
old O
fairy O
tales O
and O
other O
ballads O
; O
or O
( O
as O
at O
a O
later O
period O
I O
discovered O
) O
from O
the O
pages O
of O
Pamela O
, O
and O
Henry O
, O
Earl O
of O
Moreland O
. O
With O
Bewick O
on O
my O
knee O
, O
I O
was O
then O
happy O
: O
happy O
at O
least O
in O
my O
way O
. O
I O
feared O
nothing O
but O
interruption O
, O
and O
that O
came O
too O
soon O
. O
The O
breakfast O
- O
room O
door O
opened O
. O
" O
Boh O
! O
Madam O
Mope O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
voice O
of O
John O
Reed O
; O
then O
he O
paused O
: O
he O
found O
the O
room O
apparently O
empty O
. O
" O
Where O
the O
dickens O
is O
she O
! O
" O
he O
continued O
. O
" O
Lizzy O
! O
Georgy O
! O
( O
calling O
to O
his O
sisters O
) O
Joan O
is O
not O
here O
: O
tell O
mama O
she O
is O
run O
out O
into O
the O
rain O
-- O
bad O
animal O
! O
" O
" O
It O
is O
well O
I O
drew O
the O
curtain O
, O
" O
thought O
I O
; O
and O
I O
wished O
fervently O
he O
might O
not O
discover O
my O
hiding-place O
: O
nor O
would O
John O
Reed O
have O
found O
it O
out O
himself O
; O
he O
was O
not O
quick O
either O
of O
vision O
or O
conception O
; O
but O
Eliza O
just O
put O
her O
head O
in O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
said O
at O
once O
-- O
" O
She O
is O
in O
the O
window-seat O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
Jack O
. O
" O
And O
I O
came O
out O
immediately O
, O
for O
I O
trembled O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
dragged O
forth O
by O
the O
said O
Jack O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
, O
with O
awkward O
diffidence O
. O
" O
Say O
, O
' O
What O
do O
you O
want O
, O
Master O
Reed O
? O
' O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
come O
here O
; O
" O
and O
seating O
himself O
in O
an O
arm-chair O
, O
he O
intimated O
by O
a O
gesture O
that O
I O
was O
to O
approach O
and O
stand O
before O
him O
. O
John O
Reed O
was O
a O
schoolboy O
of O
fourteen O
years O
old O
; O
four O
years O
older O
than O
I O
, O
for O
I O
was O
but O
ten O
: O
large O
and O
stout O
for O
his O
age O
, O
with O
a O
dingy O
and O
unwholesome O
skin O
; O
thick O
lineaments O
in O
a O
spacious O
visage O
, O
heavy O
limbs O
and O
large O
extremities O
. O
He O
gorged O
himself O
habitually O
at O
table O
, O
which O
made O
him O
bilious O
, O
and O
gave O
him O
a O
dim O
and O
bleared O
eye O
and O
flabby O
cheeks O
. O
He O
ought O
now O
to O
have O
been O
at O
school O
; O
but O
his O
mama O
had O
taken O
him O
home O
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
" O
on O
account O
of O
his O
delicate O
health O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Miles O
, O
the O
master O
, O
affirmed O
that O
he O
would O
do O
very O
well O
if O
he O
had O
fewer O
cakes O
and O
sweetmeats O
sent O
him O
from O
home O
; O
but O
the O
mother O
's O
heart O
turned O
from O
an O
opinion O
so O
harsh O
, O
and O
inclined O
rather O
to O
the O
more O
refined O
idea O
that O
John O
's O
sallowness O
was O
owing O
to O
over-application O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
pining O
after O
home O
. O
John O
had O
not O
much O
affection O
for O
his O
mother O
and O
sisters O
, O
and O
an O
antipathy O
to O
me O
. O
He O
bullied O
and O
punished O
me O
; O
not O
two O
or O
three O
times O
in O
the O
week O
, O
nor O
once O
or O
twice O
in O
the O
day O
, O
but O
continually O
: O
every O
nerve O
I O
had O
feared O
him O
, O
and O
every O
morsel O
of O
flesh O
in O
my O
bones O
shrank O
when O
he O
came O
near O
. O
There O
were O
moments O
when O
I O
was O
bewildered O
by O
the O
terror O
he O
inspired O
, O
because O
I O
had O
no O
appeal O
whatever O
against O
either O
his O
menaces O
or O
his O
inflictions O
; O
the O
servants O
did O
not O
like O
to O
offend O
their O
young O
master O
by O
taking O
my O
part O
against O
him O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Reed O
was O
blind O
and O
deaf O
on O
the O
subject O
: O
she O
never O
saw O
him O
strike O
or O
heard O
him O
abuse O
me O
, O
though O
he O
did O
both O
now O
and O
then O
in O
her O
very O
presence O
, O
more O
frequently O
, O
however O
, O
behind O
her O
back O
. O
Habitually O
obedient O
to O
John O
, O
I O
came O
up O
to O
his O
chair O
: O
he O
spent O
some O
three O
minutes O
in O
thrusting O
out O
his O
tongue O
at O
me O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
without O
damaging O
the O
roots O
: O
I O
knew O
he O
would O
soon O
strike O
, O
and O
while O
dreading O
the O
blow O
, O
I O
mused O
on O
the O
disgusting O
and O
ugly O
appearance O
of O
him O
who O
would O
presently O
deal O
it O
. O
I O
wonder O
if O
he O
read O
that O
notion O
in O
my O
face O
; O
for O
, O
all O
at O
once O
, O
without O
speaking O
, O
he O
struck O
suddenly O
and O
strongly O
. O
I O
tottered O
, O
and O
on O
regaining O
my O
equilibrium O
retired O
back O
a O
step O
or O
two O
from O
his O
chair O
. O
" O
That O
is O
for O
your O
impudence O
in O
answering O
mama O
awhile O
since O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
and O
for O
your O
sneaking O
way O
of O
getting O
behind O
curtains O
, O
and O
for O
the O
look O
you O
had O
in O
your O
eyes O
two O
minutes O
since O
, O
you O
rat O
! O
" O
Accustomed O
to O
John O
Reed O
's O
abuse O
, O
I O
never O
had O
an O
idea O
of O
replying O
to O
it O
; O
my O
care O
was O
how O
to O
endure O
the O
blow O
which O
would O
certainly O
follow O
the O
insult O
. O
" O
What O
were O
you O
doing O
behind O
the O
curtain O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
I O
was O
reading O
. O
" O
" O
Show O
the O
book O
. O
" O
I O
returned O
to O
the O
window O
and O
fetched O
it O
thence O
. O
" O
You O
have O
no O
business O
to O
take O
our O
books O

you O
have O
no O
money O

your O

I O
did O
so O

not O
at O
first O
aware O
what O
was O
his O
intention O
; O

when O
I O
saw O
him O
lift O
and O
poise O
the O
book O

stand O
in O
act O

hurl O
it O

I O
instinctively O
started O
aside O

a O
cry O

alarm O

not O
soon O
enough O

; O
the O
volume O
was O
flung O

it O
hit O
me O
, O
and O
I O
fell O
, O
striking O
my O
head O
against O
the O
door O

cutting O
it O

The O
cut O
bled O

the O
pain O
was O
sharp O

passed O
its O

boxes O
and O
warming O
pans O
. O
But O
even O
as O
this O
quaint O
figure O
vanished O
there O
sprang O
up O
a O
new O
and O
glittering O
one O
to O
take O
his O
place O
. O
He O
stood O
framed O
in O
the O
great O
plate-glass O
window O
of O
the O
very O
building O
which O
had O
brought O
about O
the O
defeat O
of O
his O
predecessor O
. O
A O
miracle O
of O
close O
shaving O
his O
face O
was O
, O
and O
a O
marvel O
of O
immaculateness O
his O
linen O
. O
Dapper O
he O
was O
, O
and O
dressy O
, O
albeit O
inclined O
to O
glittering O
effects O
and O
a O
certain O
plethory O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O
. O
Back O
of O
him O
stood O
shining O
shapes O
that O
reflected O
his O
glory O
in O
enamel O
, O
and O
brass O
, O
and O
glass O
. O
His O
language O
was O
floral O
, O
but O
choice O
; O
his O
talk O
was O
of O
gearings O
and O
bearings O
and O
cylinders O
and O
magnetos O
; O
his O
method O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
him O
who O
went O
before O
as O
the O
method O
of O
a O
skilled O
aëronaut O
differs O
from O
that O
of O
the O
man O
who O
goes O
over O
Niagara O
in O
a O
barrel O
. O
And O
as O
he O
multiplied O
and O
spread O
over O
the O
land O
we O
coined O
a O
new O
figure O
of O
speech O
. O
" O
Smooth O
! O
" O
we O
chuckled O
. O
" O
As O
smooth O
as O
an O
automobile O
salesman O
. O
" O
But O
even O
as O
we O
listened O
, O
fascinated O
by O
his O
fluent O
verbiage O
there O
grew O
within O
us O
a O
certain O
resentment O
. O
Familiarity O
with O
his O
glittering O
wares O
bred O
a O
contempt O
of O
them O
, O
so O
that O
he O
fell O
to O
speaking O
of O
them O
as O
necessities O
instead O
of O
luxuries O
. O
He O
juggled O
figures O
, O
and O
thought O
nothing O
of O
four O
of O
them O
in O
a O
row O
. O
We O
looked O
at O
our O
five-thousand-dollar O
salary O
, O
so O
strangely O
shrunken O
and O
thin O
now O
, O
and O
even O
as O
we O
looked O
we O
saw O
that O
the O
method O
of O
the O
unctuous O
, O
anxious O
stranger O
had O
become O
antiquated O
in O
its O
turn O
. O
Then O
from O
his O
ashes O
emerged O
a O
new O
being O
. O
Neither O
urger O
nor O
spellbinder O
he O
. O
The O
twentieth O
century O
was O
stamped O
across O
his O
brow O
, O
and O
on O
his O
lips O
was O
ever O
the O
word O
" O
Service O
. O
" O
Silent O
, O
courteous O
, O
watchful O
, O
alert O
, O
he O
listened O
, O
while O
you O
talked O
. O
His O
method O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
made O
that O
of O
the O
silk-lined O
salesman O
sound O
like O
the O
hoarse O
hoots O
of O
the O
ballyhoo O
man O
at O
a O
county O
fair O
. O
Blithely O
he O
accepted O
five O
hundred O
thousand O
dollars O
and O
gave O
in O
return O
-- O
a O
promise O
. O
And O
when O
we O
would O
search O
our O
soul O
for O
a O
synonym O
to O
express O
all O
that O
was O
low-voiced O
, O
and O
suave O
, O
and O
judicious O
, O
and O
patient O
, O
and O
sure O
, O
we O
began O
to O
say O
, O
" O
As O
alert O
as O
an O
advertising O
expert O

" O
Jock O
McChesney O
, O
looking O
as O
fresh O
and O
clear-eyed O
as O
only O
twenty-one O
and O
a O
cold O
shower O
can O
make O
one O
look O
, O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway O
of O
his O
mother O
's O
bedroom O
. O
His O
toilette O
had O
halted O
abruptly O
at O
the O
bathrobe O
stage O
. O
One O
of O
those O
bulky O
garments O
swathed O
his O
slim O
figure O
, O
while O
over O
his O
left O
arm O
hung O
a O
gray O
tweed O
Norfolk O
coat O
. O
From O
his O
right O
hand O
dangled O
a O
pair O
of O
trousers O
, O
in O
pattern O
a O
modish O
black-and-white O
. O
Jock O
regarded O
the O
gray O
garment O
on O
his O
arm O
with O
moody O
eyes O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
know O
what O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
it O
! O
" O
he O
demanded O
, O
a O
trifle O
irritably O
. O
Emma O
McChesney O
, O
in O
the O
act O
of O
surveying O
her O
back O
hair O
in O
the O
mirror O
, O
paused O
, O
hand O
glass O
poised O
half O
way O
, O
to O
regard O
her O
son O
. O
" O
All O
right O
, O
" O
she O
answered O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
. O
It O
's O
too O
young O
. O
" O
" O
Young O
! O
" O
He O
held O
it O
at O
arm O
's O
length O
and O
stared O
at O
it O
. O
" O
What O
d'you O
mean O
-- O
young O
? O
" O
Emma O
McChesney O
came O
forward O
, O
wrapping O
the O
folds O
of O
her O
kimono O
about O
her O
. O
She O
took O
the O
disputed O
garment O
in O
one O
hand O
and O
held O
it O
aloft O
. O
" O
I O
know O
that O
you O
look O
like O
a O
man O
on O
a O
magazine O

in O
it O

But O
Norfolk O

And O
you O
're O
going O
out O
this O
morning O
, O
Son O
, O
to O
interview O
business O
men O
. O
You O
're O
going O
to O
try O
to O
impress O
the O
advertising O
world O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
needs O
your O
expert O
services O
. O
You O
walk O
into O
a O
business O
office O
in O
a O
Norfolk O
suit O
, O
and O
everybody O
from O
the O
office O
boy O
to O
the O
president O
of O
the O
company O
will O
ask O
you O
what O
your O
score O
is O
. O
" O
She O
tossed O
it O
back O
over O
his O
arm O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
wear O
the O
black O
and O
white O
, O
" O
said O
Jock O
resignedly O
, O
and O
turned O
toward O
his O
own O
room O
. O
At O
his O
doorway O
he O
paused O
and O
raised O
his O
voice O
slightly O
: O
" O
For O
that O
matter O
, O
they O
're O
looking O
for O
young O
men O
. O
Everybody O
's O
young O
. O
Why O
, O
the O
biggest O
men O
in O
the O
advertising O
game O
are O
just O
kids O
. O
" O
He O
disappeared O
within O
his O
room O
, O
still O
talking O
. O
" O
Look O
at O
McQuirk O
, O
advertising O
manager O
of O
the O
Combs O
Car O
Company O
. O
He O
's O
so O
young O
he O
has O
to O
disguise O
himself O
in O
bone-trimmed O
eye-glasses O
with O
a O
black O
ribbon O
to O
get O
away O
with O
it O
. O
Look O
at O
Hopper O
, O
of O
the O
Berg O
, O
Shriner O
Company O
. O
Pulls O
down O
ninety O
thousand O
a O
year O
, O
and O
if O
he O
's O
thirty-five O
I O
'll O
-- O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
you O
asked O
my O
advice O
, O
" O
interrupted O
his O
mother O
's O
voice O
with O
that O
muffled O
effect O
which O
is O
caused O
by O
a O
skirt O
being O
slipped O
over O
the O
head O
, O
" O
and O
I O
gave O
it O

Wear O
a O
white O
duck O

suit O
with O
blue O
anchors O
and O
carry O
a O
red O
tin O
pail O
and O
a O
shovel O

you O
want O
to O
look O

get O
into O
it O
in O
a O
jiffy O

breakfast O
will O
be O
ready O

ten O
minutes O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
by O
the O
way O

So O
step O
lively O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
your O
lovely O
mother O
's O
subway O
fare O
. O
" O
Ten O
minutes O
later O
the O
slim O
young O
figure O
, O
in O
its O
English-fitting O
black O
and O
white O
, O
sat O
opposite O
Emma O
McChesney O
at O
the O
breakfast O
table O
and O
between O
excited O
gulps O
of O
coffee O
outlined O
a O
meteoric O
career O
in O
his O
chosen O
field O
. O
And O
the O
more O
he O
talked O
and O
the O
rosier O
his O
figures O
of O
speech O
became O
, O
the O
more O
silent O
and O
thoughtful O
fell O
his O
mother O
. O
She O
wondered O
if O
five O
o'clock O
would O
find O
a O
droop O
to O
the O
set O
of O
those O
young O
shoulders O
; O
if O
the O
springy O
young O
legs O
in O
their O
absurdly O
scant O
modish O
trousers O
would O
have O
lost O
some O
of O
their O
elasticity O
; O
if O
the O
buoyant O
step O
in O
the O
flat-heeled O
shoes O
would O
not O
drag O
a O
little O
. O
Thirteen O
years O
of O
business O
experience O
had O
taught O
her O
to O
swallow O
smilingly O
the O
bitter O
pill O
of O
rebuff O
. O
But O
this O
boy O
was O
to O
experience O
his O
first O
dose O
to-day O
. O
She O
felt O
again O
that O
sensation O
of O
almost O
physical O
nausea O
-- O
that O
sickness O
of O
heart O
and O
spirit O
which O
had O
come O
over O
her O
when O
she O
had O
met O
her O
first O
sneer O
and O
intolerant O
shrug O
. O
It O
had O
been O
her O
maiden O
trip O
on O
the O
road O
for O
the O
T.A. O
Buck O
Featherloom O
Petticoat O
Company O
. O
She O
was O
secretary O
of O
that O
company O
now O
, O
and O
moving O
spirit O
in O
its O
policy O
. O
But O
the O
wound O
of O
that O
first O
insult O
still O
ached O
. O
A O
word O
from O
her O
would O
have O
placed O
the O
boy O
and O
saved O
him O
from O
curt O
refusals O
. O
She O
withheld O
that O
word O
. O
He O
must O
fight O
his O
fight O
alone O
. O
" O
I O
want O
to O
write O
the O
kind O
of O
ad O
, O
" O
Jock O
was O
saying O
excitedly O
, O
" O
that O
you O
see O
'em O
staring O
at O
in O
the O
subways O
, O
and O
street O
cars O
and O
L-trains O
. O
I O
want O
to O
sit O
across O
the O
aisle O
and O
watch O
their O
up-turned O
faces O
staring O
at O
that O
oblong O
, O
and O
reading O
it O
aloud O
to O
each O
other O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
n't O
that O
an O
awfully O
obvious O
necktie O
you O
're O
wearing O
, O
Jock O
? O
" O
inquired O
his O
mother O
irrelevantly O
. O
" O
This O
? O
You O
ought O
to O
see O
some O
of O
them O
. O
This O
is O
a O
Quaker O
stock O
in O
comparison O
. O
" O
He O
glanced O
down O
complacently O
at O
the O
vivid-hued O
silken O
scarf O
that O
the O
season O
's O
mode O
demanded O
. O
Immediately O
he O
was O
off O
again O

" O

the O
first O
thing O

carrying O
my O

the O

in O
sacks O

" O
Emma O
McChesney O
buttered O
her O
bit O
of O
toast O
, O
then O
looked O
up O
to O
remark O
quietly O
: O

she-owl O
. O
They O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
over O
and O
over O
again O
so O
emphatically O
that O
I O
think O
it O
must O
be O
something O
nasty O
about O
me O
; O
but O
I O
shall O
not O
let O
myself O
be O
frightened O
away O
by O
the O
sarcasm O
of O
owls O
. O
This O
is O
less O
a O
garden O
than O
a O
wilderness O
. O
No O
one O
has O
lived O
in O
the O
house O
, O
much O
less O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
for O
twenty-five O
years O
, O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a O
pretty O
old O
place O
that O
the O
people O
who O
might O
have O
lived O
here O
and O
did O
not O
, O
deliberately O
preferring O
the O
horrors O
of O
a O
flat O
in O
a O
town O
, O
must O
have O
belonged O
to O
that O
vast O
number O
of O
eyeless O
and O
earless O
persons O
of O
whom O
the O
world O
seems O
chiefly O
composed O
. O
Noseless O
too O
, O
though O
it O
does O
not O
sound O
pretty O
; O
but O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
my O
spring O
happiness O
is O
due O
to O
the O
scent O
of O
the O
wet O
earth O
and O
young O
leaves O
. O
I O
am O
always O
happy O
( O
out O
of O
doors O
be O
it O
understood O
, O
for O
indoors O
there O
are O
servants O
and O
furniture O
) O
but O
in O
quite O
different O
ways O
, O
and O
my O
spring O
happiness O
bears O
no O
resemblance O
to O
my O
summer O
or O
autumn O
happiness O
, O
though O
it O
is O
not O
more O
intense O
, O
and O
there O
were O
days O
last O
winter O
when O
I O
danced O
for O
sheer O
joy O
out O
in O
my O
frost-bound O
garden O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
my O
years O
and O
children O
. O
But O
I O
did O
it O
behind O
a O
bush O
, O
having O
a O
due O
regard O
for O
the O
decencies O
. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
bird-cherries O
round O
me O
, O
great O
trees O
with O
branches O
sweeping O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
they O
are O
so O
wreathed O
just O
now O
with O
white O
blossoms O
and O
tenderest O
green O
that O
the O
garden O
looks O
like O
a O
wedding O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
masses O
of O
them O
; O
they O
seemed O
to O
fill O
the O
place O
. O
Even O
across O
a O
little O
stream O
that O
bounds O
the O
garden O
on O
the O
east O
, O
and O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
cornfield O
beyond O
, O
there O
is O
an O
immense O
one O
, O
a O
picture O
of O
grace O
and O
glory O
against O
the O
cold O
blue O
of O
the O
spring O
sky O
. O
My O
garden O
is O
surrounded O
by O
cornfields O
and O
meadows O
, O
and O
beyond O
are O
great O
stretches O
of O
sandy O
heath O
and O
pine O
forests O
, O
and O
where O
the O
forests O
leave O
off O
the O
bare O
heath O
begins O
again O
; O
but O
the O
forests O
are O
beautiful O
in O
their O
lofty O
, O
pink-stemmed O
vastness O
, O
far O
overhead O
the O
crowns O
of O
softest O
gray-green O
, O
and O
underfoot O
a O
bright O
green O
wortleberry O
carpet O
, O
and O
everywhere O
the O
breathless O
silence O
; O
and O
the O
bare O
heaths O
are O
beautiful O
too O
, O
for O
one O
can O
see O
across O
them O
into O
eternity O
almost O
, O
and O
to O
go O
out O
on O
to O
them O
with O
one O
’s O
face O
towards O
the O
setting O
sun O
is O
like O
going O
into O
the O
very O
presence O
of O
God O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
plain O
is O
the O
oasis O
of O
birdcherries O
and O
greenery O
where O
I O
spend O
my O
happy O
days O
, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
oasis O
is O
the O
gray O
stone O
house O
with O
many O
gables O
where O
I O
pass O
my O
reluctant O
nights O
. O
The O
house O
is O
very O
old O
, O
and O
has O
been O
added O
to O
at O
various O
times O
. O
It O
was O
a O
convent O
before O
the O
Thirty O
Years O
’ O
War O
, O
and O
the O
vaulted O
chapel O
, O
with O
its O
brick O
floor O
worn O
by O
pious O
peasant O
knees O
, O
is O
now O
used O
as O
a O
hall O
. O
Gustavus O
Adolphus O
and O
his O
Swedes O
passed O
through O
more O
than O
once O
, O
as O
is O
duly O
recorded O
in O
archives O
still O
preserved O
, O
for O
we O
are O
on O
what O
was O
then O
the O
high-road O
between O
Sweden O
and O
Brandenburg O
the O
unfortunate O
. O
The O
Lion O
of O
the O
North O
was O
no O
doubt O
an O
estimable O
person O
and O
acted O
wholly O
up O
to O
his O
convictions O
, O
but O
he O
must O
have O
sadly O
upset O
the O
peaceful O
nuns O
, O
who O
were O
not O
without O
convictions O
of O
their O
own O
, O
sending O
them O
out O
on O
to O
the O
wide O
, O
empty O
plain O
to O
piteously O
seek O
some O
life O
to O
replace O
the O
life O
of O
silence O
here O
. O
From O
nearly O
all O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
house O
I O
can O
look O
out O
across O
the O
plain O
, O
with O
no O
obstacle O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
hill O
, O
right O
away O
to O
a O
blue O
line O
of O
distant O
forest O
, O
and O
on O
the O
west O
side O
uninterruptedly O
to O
the O
setting O
sun O
-- O
nothing O
but O
a O
green O
, O
rolling O
plain O
, O
with O
a O
sharp O
edge O
against O
the O
sunset O
. O
I O
love O
those O
west O
windows O
better O
than O
any O
others O
, O
and O
have O
chosen O
my O
bedroom O
on O
that O
side O
of O
the O
house O
so O
that O
even O
times O
of O
hair-brushing O
may O
not O
be O
entirely O
lost O
, O
and O
the O
young O
woman O
who O
attends O
to O
such O
matters O
has O
been O
taught O
to O
fulfil O
her O
duties O
about O
a O
mistress O
recumbent O
in O
an O
easychair O
before O
an O
open O
window O
, O
and O
not O
to O
profane O
with O
chatter O
that O
sweet O
and O
solemn O
time O
. O
This O
girl O
is O
grieved O
at O
my O
habit O
of O
living O
almost O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
all O
her O
ideas O
as O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
life O
a O
respectable O
German O
lady O
should O
lead O
have O
got O
into O
a O
sad O
muddle O
since O
she O
came O
to O
me O
. O
The O
people O
round O
about O
are O
persuaded O
that O
I O
am O
, O
to O
put O
it O
as O
kindly O
as O
possible O
, O
exceedingly O
eccentric O
, O
for O
the O
news O
has O
travelled O
that O
I O
spend O
the O
day O
out O
of O
doors O
with O
a O
book O
, O
and O
that O
no O
mortal O
eye O
has O
ever O
yet O
seen O
me O
sew O
or O
cook O
. O
But O
why O
cook O
when O
you O
can O
get O
some O
one O
to O
cook O
for O
you O
? O
And O
as O
for O
sewing O
, O
the O
maids O
will O
hem O
the O
sheets O
better O
and O
quicker O
than O
I O
could O
, O
and O
all O
forms O
of O
needlework O
of O
the O
fancy O
order O
are O
inventions O
of O
the O
evil O
one O
for O
keeping O
the O
foolish O
from O
applying O
their O
heart O
to O
wisdom O
. O
We O
had O
been O
married O
five O
years O
before O
it O
struck O
us O
that O
we O
might O
as O
well O
make O
use O
of O
this O
place O
by O
coming O
down O
and O
living O
in O
it O
. O
Those O
five O
years O
were O
spent O
in O
a O
flat O
in O
a O
town O
, O
and O
during O
their O
whole O
interminable O
length O
I O
was O
perfectly O
miserable O
and O
perfectly O
healthy O
, O
which O
disposes O
of O
the O
ugly O
notion O
that O
has O
at O
times O
disturbed O
me O
that O
my O
happiness O
here O
is O
less O
due O
to O
the O
garden O
than O
to O
a O
good O
digestion O
. O
And O
while O
we O
were O
wasting O
our O
lives O
there O
, O
here O
was O
this O
dear O
place O
with O
dandelions O
up O
to O
the O
very O
door O
, O
all O
the O
paths O
grass-grown O
and O
completely O
effaced O
, O
in O
winter O
so O
lonely O
, O
with O
nobody O
but O
the O
north O
wind O
taking O
the O
least O
notice O
of O
it O
, O
and O
in O
May O
-- O
in O
all O
those O
five O
lovely O
Mays O
-- O
no O
one O
to O
look O
at O
the O
wonderful O
bird-cherries O
and O
still O
more O
wonderful O
masses O
of O
lilacs O
, O
everything O
glowing O
and O
blowing O
, O
the O
virginia O
creeper O
madder O
every O
year O
, O
until O
at O
last O
, O
in O
October O
, O
the O
very O
roof O
was O
wreathed O
with O
blood-red O
tresses O
, O
the O
owls O
and O
the O
squirrels O
and O
all O
the O
blessed O
little O
birds O
reigning O
supreme O
, O
and O
not O
a O
living O
creature O
ever O
entering O
the O
empty O
house O
except O
the O
snakes O
, O
which O
got O
into O
the O
habit O
during O
those O
silent O
years O
of O
wriggling O
up O
the O
south O
wall O
into O
the O
rooms O
on O
that O
side O
whenever O
the O
old O
housekeeper O
opened O
the O
windows O
. O
All O
that O
was O
here O
, O
-- O
peace O
, O
and O
happiness O
, O
and O
a O
reasonable O
life O
, O
-- O
and O
yet O
it O
never O
struck O
me O
to O
come O
and O
live O
in O
it O
. O
Looking O
back O
I O
am O
astonished O
, O
and O
can O
in O
no O
way O
account O
for O
the O
tardiness O
of O
my O
discovery O
that O
here O
, O
in O
this O
far-away O
corner O
, O
was O
my O
kingdom O
of O
heaven O
. O
Indeed O
, O
so O
little O
did O
it O
enter O
my O
head O
to O
even O
use O
the O
place O
in O
summer O
, O
that O
I O
submitted O
to O
weeks O
of O
seaside O
life O
with O
all O
its O
horrors O
every O
year O
; O
until O
at O
last O
, O
in O
the O
early O
spring O
of O
last O
year O
, O
having O
come O
down O
for O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
village O
school O
, O
and O
wandering O
out O
afterwards O
into O
the O
bare O
and O
desolate O
garden O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
smell O
of O
wet O
earth O
or O
rotting O
leaves O
brought O
back O
my O
childhood O
with O
a O
rush O
and O
all O
the O
happy O
days O
I O
had O
spent O
in O
a O
garden O
. O
Shall O
I O
ever O
forget O
that O
day O
? O
It O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
my O
real O
life O
, O
my O
coming O
of O
age O
as O
it O
were O
, O
and O
entering O
into O
my O
kingdom O
. O
Early O
March O
, O
gray O
, O
quiet O
skies O
, O
and O
brown O
, O
quiet O
earth O
; O
leafless O
and O
sad O
and O
lonely O
enough O
out O
there O
in O
the O
damp O
and O
silence O
, O
yet O
there O
I O
stood O
feeling O
the O
same O
rapture O
of O
pure O
delight O
in O
the O
first O
breath O
of O
spring O
that O
I O
used O
to O
as O
a O
child O
, O
and O
the O
five O
wasted O
years O
fell O
from O
me O
like O
a O
cloak O
, O
and O
the O
world O
was O
full O
of O
hope O
, O
and O
I O
vowed O
myself O
then O
and O
there O
to O
nature O
, O
and O
have O
been O
happy O
ever O
since O
. O
My O
other O
half O
being O
indulgent O
, O
and O
with O
some O
faint O
thought O
perhaps O
that O
it O
might O
be O
as O
well O
to O
look O
after O
the O
place O
, O
consented O
to O
live O
in O
it O
at O
any O
rate O
for O
a O
time O
; O
whereupon O
followed O
six O
specially O
blissful O
weeks O
from O
the O
end O
of O
April O
into O
June O
, O
during O
which O
I O
was O
here O
alone O
, O
supposed O
to O
be O
superintending O
the O
painting O
and O
papering O
, O
but O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
only O
going O
into O
the O
house O
when O
the O
workmen O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
it O
. O
How O
happy O
I O
was O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
remember O
any O
time O
quite O
so O
perfect O
since O
the O
days O
when O
I O
was O
too O
little O
to O
do O
lessons O
and O
was O
turned O
out O
with O
sugar O
on O
my O
eleven O
o’clock O
bread O
and O
butter O
on O
to O
a O
lawn O
closely O
strewn O
with O
dandelions O
and O
daisies O
. O
The O
sugar O
on O
the O
bread O
and O
butter O
has O
lost O
its O
charm O
, O
but O
I O
love O
the O
dandelions O
and O
daisies O
even O
more O
passionately O
now O
than O
then O
, O
and O
never O
would O
endure O
to O
see O
them O
all O
mown O
away O
if O
I O
were O
not O
certain O
that O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two O
they O
would O
be O
pushing O
up O
their O
little O
faces O
again O
as O
jauntily O
as O
ever O
. O
During O
those O
six O
weeks O
I O
lived O
in O
a O
world O
of O
dandelions O
and O
delights O
. O
The O
dandelions O
carpeted O
the O
three O
lawns O
, O
-- O
they O
used O
to O
be O
lawns O
, O
but O
have O
long O
since O
blossomed O
out O
into O
meadows O
filled O
with O
every O
sort O
of O
pretty O
weed O
, O
-- O
and O
under O
and O
among O
the O
groups O
of O
leafless O
oaks O
and O
beeches O
were O
blue O
hepaticas O
, O
white O
anemones O
, O
violets O
, O
and O
celandines O
in O
sheets O
. O
The O
celandines O
in O
particular O
delighted O
me O
with O
their O
clean O
, O
happy O
brightness O
, O
so O
beautifully O
trim O
and O
newly O
varnished O
, O
as O
though O
they O
too O
had O
had O
the O
painters O
at O
work O
on O
them O
. O
Then O
, O
when O
the O
anemones O
went O
, O
came O
a O
few O
stray O
periwinkles O
and O
Solomon O
’s O
Seal O
, O
and O
all O
the O
birdcherries O
blossomed O
in O
a O
burst O
. O
And O
then O
, O
before O
I O
had O
a O
little O
got O
used O
to O
the O
joy O
of O
their O
flowers O
against O
the O
sky O
, O
came O
the O
lilacs O
-- O
masses O
and O
masses O
of O
them O
, O
in O
clumps O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
with O
other O
shrubs O
and O
trees O
by O
the O
side O
of O
walks O
, O
and O
one O
great O
continuous O
bank O
of O
them O
half O
a O
mile O
long O
right O
past O
the O
west O
front O
of O
the O
house O
, O
away O
down O
as O
far O
as O
one O
could O
see O
, O
shining O
glorious O
against O
a O
background O
of O
firs O
. O
When O
that O
time O
came O
, O
and O
when O
, O
before O
it O
was O
over O
, O
the O
acacias O
all O
blossomed O
too O
, O
and O
four O
great O
clumps O
of O
pale O
, O
silvery-pink O
peonies O
flowered O
under O
the O
south O
windows O
, O
I O
felt O
so O
absolutely O
happy O
, O
and O
blest O
, O
and O
thankful O
, O
and O
grateful O
, O
that O
I O
really O
can O
not O
describe O
it O
. O
My O
days O
seemed O
to O
melt O
away O
in O
a O
dream O
of O
pink O
and O
purple O
peace O

said O
his O
lady O
to O
him O
one O
day O
, O
" O
have O
you O
heard O
that O
Netherfield O
Park O
is O
let O
at O
last O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
not O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
, O
" O
returned O
she O
; O
" O
for O
Mrs. O
Long O
has O
just O
been O
here O
, O
and O
she O
told O
me O
all O
about O
it O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
not O
want O
to O
know O
who O
has O
taken O
it O
? O
" O
cried O
his O
wife O
impatiently O
. O
" O
_ O
You O
_ O
want O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
hearing O
it O
. O
" O
This O
was O
invitation O
enough O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
must O
know O
, O
Mrs. O
Long O
says O
that O
Netherfield O
is O
taken O
by O
a O
young O
man O
of O
large O
fortune O
from O
the O
north O
of O
England O
; O
that O
he O
came O
down O
on O
Monday O
in O
a O
chaise O
and O
four O
to O
see O
the O
place O
, O
and O
was O
so O
much O
delighted O
with O
it O
, O
that O
he O
agreed O
with O
Mr. O
Morris O
immediately O
; O
that O
he O
is O
to O
take O
possession O
before O
Michaelmas O
, O
and O
some O
of O
his O
servants O
are O
to O
be O
in O
the O
house O
by O
the O
end O
of O
next O
week O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
his O
name O
? O
" O
" O
Bingley O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
he O
married O
or O
single O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
Single O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
A O
single O
man O
of O
large O
fortune O
; O
four O
or O
five O
thousand O
a O
year O
. O
What O
a O
fine O
thing O
for O
our O
girls O
! O
" O
" O
How O
so O
? O
How O
can O
it O
affect O
them O
? O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
wife O
, O
" O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
tiresome O
! O
You O
must O
know O
that O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
his O
marrying O
one O
of O
them O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
that O
his O
design O
in O
settling O
here O
? O
" O
" O
Design O
! O
Nonsense O
, O
how O
can O
you O
talk O
so O
! O
But O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
he O
_ O
may O
_ O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
one O
of O
them O
, O
and O
therefore O
you O
must O
visit O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
comes O
. O
" O
" O
I O
see O
no O
occasion O
for O
that O
. O
You O
and O
the O
girls O
may O
go O
, O
or O
you O
may O
send O
them O
by O
themselves O
, O
which O
perhaps O
will O
be O
still O
better O
, O
for O
as O
you O
are O
as O
handsome O
as O
any O
of O
them O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
may O
like O
you O
the O
best O
of O
the O
party O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
you O
flatter O
me O
. O
I O
certainly O
_ O
have O
_ O
had O
my O
share O
of O
beauty O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
be O
anything O
extraordinary O
now O
. O
When O
a O
woman O
has O
five O
grown-up O
daughters O
, O
she O
ought O
to O
give O
over O
thinking O
of O
her O
own O
beauty O
. O
" O
" O
In O
such O
cases O
, O
a O
woman O
has O
not O
often O
much O
beauty O
to O
think O
of O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
must O
indeed O
go O
and O
see O
Mr. O
Bingley O
when O
he O
comes O
into O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
more O
than O
I O
engage O
for O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
" O
" O
But O
consider O
your O
daughters O
. O
Only O
think O
what O
an O
establishment O
it O
would O
be O
for O
one O
of O
them O
. O
Sir O
William O
and O
Lady O
Lucas O
are O
determined O
to O
go O
, O
merely O
on O
that O
account O
, O
for O
in O
general O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
visit O
no O
newcomers O
. O
Indeed O
you O
must O
go O
, O
for O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
_ O
us O
_ O
to O
visit O
him O
if O
you O
do O
not O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
over-scrupulous O
, O
surely O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
be O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
; O
and O
I O
will O
send O
a O
few O
lines O
by O
you O
to O
assure O
him O
of O
my O
hearty O
consent O
to O
his O
marrying O
whichever O
he O
chooses O
of O
the O
girls O
; O
though O
I O
must O
throw O
in O
a O
good O
word O
for O
my O
little O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
" O
I O
desire O
you O
will O
do O
no O
such O
thing O
. O
Lizzy O
is O
not O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
others O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
is O
not O
half O
so O
handsome O
as O
Jane O
, O
nor O
half O
so O
good-humoured O
as O
Lydia O
. O
But O
you O
are O
always O
giving O
_ O
her O
_ O
the O
preference O
. O
" O
" O
They O
have O
none O
of O
them O
much O
to O
recommend O
them O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
; O
" O
they O
are O
all O
silly O
and O
ignorant O
like O
other O
girls O
; O
but O
Lizzy O
has O
something O
more O
of O
quickness O
than O
her O
sisters O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
how O
_ O
can O
_ O
you O
abuse O
your O
own O
children O
in O
such O
a O
way O
? O
You O
take O
delight O
in O
vexing O
me O
. O
You O
have O
no O
compassion O
for O
my O
poor O
nerves O
. O
" O
" O
You O
mistake O
me O
, O
my O
dear O

I O
have O
a O
high O
respect O
for O
your O
nerves O

They O
are O
my O
old O
friends O

have O
heard O
you O
mention O

twenty O

Ah O

you O
do O
not O

I O
hope O
you O
will O
get O
over O
it O

that O
when O

twenty O

I O
will O

Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
so O
odd O
a O
mixture O
of O
quick O
parts O
, O
sarcastic O
humour O
, O
reserve O
, O
and O
caprice O
, O
that O
the O
experience O
of O
three-and-twenty O
years O
had O
been O
insufficient O
to O
make O
his O
wife O
understand O
his O
character O
. O
_ O
Her O
_ O
mind O
was O
less O
difficult O
to O
develop O
. O
She O
was O
a O
woman O
of O
mean O
understanding O
, O
little O
information O
, O
and O
uncertain O
temper O
. O
When O
she O
was O
discontented O
, O
she O
fancied O
herself O
nervous O
. O
The O
business O
of O
her O
life O
was O
to O
get O
her O
daughters O
married O
; O
its O
solace O
was O
visiting O
and O
news O
. O
Chapter O
2 O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
among O
the O
earliest O
of O
those O
who O
waited O
on O
Mr. O
Bingley O
. O
He O
had O
always O
intended O
to O
visit O
him O
, O
though O
to O
the O
last O
always O
assuring O
his O
wife O
that O
he O
should O
not O
go O
; O
and O
till O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
visit O
was O
paid O
she O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
it O
. O
It O
was O
then O
disclosed O
in O
the O
following O
manner O
. O
Observing O
his O
second O
daughter O
employed O
in O
trimming O
a O
hat O
, O
he O
suddenly O
addressed O
her O
with O
: O
" O
I O
hope O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
like O
it O
, O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
" O
We O
are O
not O
in O
a O
way O
to O
know O
_ O
what O
_ O
Mr. O

likes O

" O
said O
her O
mother O
resentfully O
, O
" O
since O
we O
are O
not O
to O
visit O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
forget O
, O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
that O
we O
shall O
meet O
him O
at O
the O
assemblies O
, O
and O
that O
Mrs. O
Long O
promised O
to O
introduce O
him O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
Mrs. O
Long O
will O
do O
any O
such O
thing O
. O
She O
has O
two O
nieces O
of O
her O
own O

She O
is O
a O
selfish O
, O
hypocritical O
woman O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
" O
" O
No O
more O

I O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
; O
" O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
her O
serving O
you O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
deigned O
not O
to O
make O
any O
reply O
, O
but O
, O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself O
, O
began O
scolding O
one O
of O
her O
daughters O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
keep O
coughing O
so O
, O
Kitty O
, O
for O

To-morrow O

so O
it O
is O

cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
and O
Mrs. O
Long O
does O
not O
come O
back O
till O
the O
day O
before O
; O
so O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
introduce O
him O
, O
for O
she O
will O
not O
know O
him O
herself O

" O
" O
Then O
, O
my O
dear O

you O
may O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
your O
friend O

introduce O
Mr. O

to O
_ O
her O
_ O

" O
" O
Impossible O

Mr. O

can O
you O
be O
so O
teasing O
? O
" O
" O
I O
honour O
your O
circumspection O

A O
fortnight O
's O
acquaintance O
is O
certainly O
very O
little O

One O
can O
not O
know O
what O
a O
man O
really O
is O
by O
the O
end O
of O
a O
fortnight O

But O
if O
_ O
we O

do O
not O
venture O
somebody O
else O
will O
; O
and O
after O
all O
, O
Mrs. O
Long O
and O
her O
neices O
must O
stand O
their O
chance O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
she O
will O
think O
it O
an O
act O
of O
kindness O
, O
if O
you O
decline O
the O
office O
, O
I O
will O
take O
it O
on O
myself O

" O
The O
girls O
stared O
at O
their O
father O

Mrs. O
Bennet O
said O
only O
, O
" O
Nonsense O

nonsense O

" O
" O
What O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
emphatic O
exclamation O

" O
cried O
he O

you O
consider O
the O
forms O
of O
introduction O

the O

The O
astonishment O
of O

what O

wished O

that O
of O

perhaps O
surpassing O
the O
rest O

when O
the O
first O

over O

began O
to O

how O
pleased O

it O

good O

too O

should O

gone O
this O

saw O
any O
likeness O
of O
either O
of O
them O
( O
for O
their O
days O
were O
long O
before O
the O
days O
of O
photographs O
) O
, O
my O
first O
fancies O
regarding O
what O
they O
were O
like O
were O
unreasonably O
derived O
from O
their O
tombstones O
. O
The O
shape O
of O
the O
letters O
on O
my O
father O
's O
, O
gave O
me O
an O
odd O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
a O
square O
, O
stout O
, O
dark O
man O
, O
with O
curly O
black O
hair O
. O
From O
the O
character O
and O
turn O
of O
the O
inscription O
, O
" O
Also O
Georgiana O
Wife O
of O
the O
Above O
, O
" O
I O
drew O
a O
childish O
conclusion O
that O
my O
mother O
was O
freckled O
and O
sickly O
. O
To O
five O
little O
stone O
lozenges O
, O
each O
about O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half O
long O
, O
which O
were O
arranged O
in O
a O
neat O
row O
beside O
their O
grave O
, O
and O
were O
sacred O
to O
the O
memory O
of O
five O
little O
brothers O
of O
mine O
, O
-- O
who O
gave O
up O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
living O
, O
exceedingly O
early O
in O
that O
universal O
struggle O
, O
-- O
I O
am O
indebted O
for O
a O
belief O
I O
religiously O
entertained O
that O
they O
had O
all O
been O
born O
on O
their O
backs O
with O
their O
hands O
in O
their O
trousers-pockets O
, O
and O
had O
never O
taken O
them O
out O
in O
this O
state O
of O
existence O
. O
Ours O
was O
the O
marsh O
country O
, O
down O
by O
the O
river O
, O
within O
, O
as O
the O
river O
wound O
, O
twenty O
miles O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
My O
first O
most O
vivid O
and O
broad O
impression O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
things O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
have O
been O
gained O
on O
a O
memorable O
raw O
afternoon O
towards O
evening O
. O
At O
such O
a O
time O
I O
found O
out O
for O
certain O
that O
this O
bleak O
place O
overgrown O
with O
nettles O
was O
the O
churchyard O
; O
and O
that O
Philip O
Pirrip O
, O
late O
of O
this O
parish O
, O
and O
also O
Georgiana O
wife O
of O
the O
above O
, O
were O
dead O
and O
buried O
; O
and O
that O
Alexander O
, O
Bartholomew O
, O
Abraham O
, O
Tobias O
, O
and O
Roger O
, O
infant O
children O
of O
the O
aforesaid O
, O
were O
also O
dead O
and O
buried O
; O
and O
that O
the O
dark O
flat O
wilderness O
beyond O
the O
churchyard O
, O
intersected O
with O
dikes O
and O
mounds O
and O
gates O
, O
with O
scattered O
cattle O
feeding O
on O
it O
, O
was O
the O
marshes O
; O
and O
that O
the O
low O
leaden O
line O
beyond O
was O
the O
river O
; O
and O
that O
the O
distant O
savage O
lair O
from O
which O
the O
wind O
was O
rushing O
was O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
that O
the O
small O
bundle O
of O
shivers O
growing O
afraid O
of O
it O
all O
and O
beginning O
to O
cry O
, O
was O
Pip O
. O
" O
Hold O
your O
noise O
! O
" O
cried O
a O
terrible O
voice O
, O
as O
a O
man O
started O
up O
from O
among O
the O
graves O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
church O
porch O
. O
" O
Keep O
still O
, O
you O
little O
devil O
, O
or O
I O
'll O
cut O
your O
throat O
! O
" O
A O
fearful O
man O
, O
all O
in O
coarse O
gray O
, O
with O
a O
great O
iron O
on O
his O
leg O
. O
A O
man O
with O
no O
hat O
, O
and O
with O
broken O
shoes O
, O
and O
with O
an O
old O
rag O
tied O
round O
his O
head O
. O
A O
man O
who O
had O
been O
soaked O
in O
water O
, O
and O
smothered O
in O
mud O
, O
and O
lamed O
by O
stones O
, O
and O
cut O
by O
flints O
, O
and O
stung O
by O
nettles O
, O
and O
torn O
by O
briars O
; O
who O
limped O
, O
and O
shivered O
, O
and O
glared O
, O
and O
growled O
; O
and O
whose O
teeth O
chattered O
in O
his O
head O
as O
he O
seized O
me O
by O
the O
chin O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Do O
n't O
cut O
my O
throat O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
I O
pleaded O
in O
terror O
. O
" O
Pray O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Tell O
us O
your O

said O
the O
man O

" O
Quick O
! O
" O
" O
Pip O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Once O
more O
, O

said O
the O
man O
, O
staring O
at O
me O
. O
" O
Give O
it O
mouth O
! O
" O
" O
Pip O
. O
Pip O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Show O
us O
where O
you O
live O
, O
" O
said O
the O
man O
. O
" O
Pint O
out O
the O
place O
! O
" O
I O
pointed O
to O
where O
our O
village O
lay O
, O
on O
the O
flat O
in-shore O
among O
the O
alder-trees O
and O
pollards O
, O
a O
mile O
or O
more O
from O
the O
church O
. O
The O
man O
, O
after O
looking O
at O
me O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
turned O
me O
upside O
down O
, O
and O
emptied O
my O
pockets O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
in O
them O
but O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
. O
When O
the O
church O
came O
to O
itself O
, O
-- O
for O
he O
was O
so O
sudden O
and O
strong O
that O
he O
made O
it O
go O
head O
over O
heels O
before O
me O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
steeple O
under O
my O
feet O
, O
-- O
when O
the O
church O
came O
to O
itself O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
was O
seated O
on O
a O
high O
tombstone O
, O
trembling O
while O
he O
ate O
the O
bread O
ravenously O
. O
" O
You O
young O
dog O
, O
" O
said O
the O
man O
, O
licking O
his O
lips O
, O
" O
what O
fat O
cheeks O
you O
ha O
' O
got O
. O
" O
I O
believe O
they O
were O
fat O
, O
though O
I O
was O
at O
that O
time O
undersized O
for O
my O
years O
, O
and O
not O
strong O
. O
" O
Darn O
me O
if O
I O
could O
n't O
eat O
em O

" O
said O
the O
man O
, O
with O
a O
threatening O
shake O
of O
his O
head O
, O
" O
and O
if O
I O
ha O
n't O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
' O
t O
! O
" O
I O
earnestly O
expressed O
my O
hope O
that O
he O
would O
n't O
, O
and O
held O
tighter O
to O
the O
tombstone O
on O
which O
he O
had O
put O
me O
; O
partly O
, O
to O
keep O
myself O
upon O
it O
; O
partly O
, O
to O
keep O
myself O
from O
crying O
. O
" O
Now O

the O
man O

" O
said O
I O

He O
started O

made O
a O
short O
run O

stopped O

looked O
over O
his O
shoulder O
. O
" O
There O
, O
sir O
! O
" O
I O
timidly O
explained O

Georgiana O

That O

" O

you O

My O

the O
blacksmith O

sir O

" O
" O
Blacksmith O
, O
eh O
? O
" O
said O
he O
. O
And O
looked O
down O
at O
his O
leg O
. O
After O
darkly O
looking O
at O
his O
leg O
and O
me O
several O
times O
, O
he O
came O
closer O
to O
my O
tombstone O
, O
took O
me O
by O
both O
arms O
, O
and O
tilted O
me O
back O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
hold O
me O
; O
so O
that O
his O
eyes O
looked O
most O
powerfully O
down O
into O
mine O
, O
and O
mine O
looked O
most O
helplessly O
up O
into O
his O
. O
" O
Now O
lookee O
here O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
the O
question O
being O
whether O
you O
're O
to O
be O
let O
to O
live O
. O
You O
know O
what O
a O
file O
is O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
And O
you O
know O
what O
wittles O
is O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
After O
each O
question O
he O
tilted O
me O
over O
a O
little O
more O
, O
so O
as O
to O
give O
me O
a O
greater O
sense O
of O
helplessness O
and O
danger O
. O
" O
You O
get O
me O
a O
file O
. O
" O
He O
tilted O
me O
again O
. O
" O
And O
you O
get O
me O
wittles O
. O
" O
He O
tilted O
me O
again O
. O
" O
You O
bring O
'em O
both O
to O
me O
. O
" O
He O
tilted O
me O
again O
. O
" O
Or O
I O
'll O
have O
your O
heart O
and O
liver O
out O
. O
" O
He O
tilted O
me O
again O
. O
I O
was O
dreadfully O
frightened O
, O
and O
so O
giddy O
that O
I O
clung O
to O
him O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
If O
you O
would O
kindly O
please O
to O
let O
me O
keep O
upright O
, O
sir O
, O
perhaps O
I O
should O
n't O
be O
sick O
, O
and O
perhaps O
I O
could O
attend O
more O
. O
" O
He O
gave O
me O
a O
most O
tremendous O
dip O
and O
roll O
, O
so O
that O
the O
church O
jumped O
over O
its O
own O
weathercock O
. O
Then O
, O
he O
held O
me O
by O
the O
arms O
, O
in O
an O
upright O
position O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stone O
, O
and O
went O
on O
in O
these O
fearful O
terms O
: O
-- O
" O
You O
bring O
me O
, O
to-morrow O
morning O
early O
, O
that O
file O
and O
them O
wittles O

You O
bring O
the O
lot O
to O
me O
, O
at O
that O
old O
Battery O
over O
yonder O

You O
do O
it O
, O
and O
you O
never O

to O
say O
a O
word O
or O
dare O
to O
make O
a O
sign O
concerning O
your O
having O

such O
a O
person O
as O
me O

or O
any O

and O
you O

You O

or O

go O
from O
my O
words O
in O
any O
partickler O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
small O
it O
is O
, O
and O
your O
heart O
and O
your O
liver O
shall O
be O
tore O
out O
, O
roasted O
, O
and O
ate O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
ai O
n't O
alone O
, O
as O
you O
may O
think O
I O
am O
. O
There O
's O
a O
young O
man O
hid O
with O
me O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
which O
young O
man O
I O
am O
a O
Angel O
. O
That O
young O
man O
hears O
the O
words O
I O
speak O
. O
That O
young O
man O
has O
a O
secret O
way O
pecooliar O
to O
himself O
, O
of O
getting O
at O
a O
boy O
, O
and O
at O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
at O
his O
liver O

It O
is O
in O
wain O
for O
a O
boy O
to O
attempt O
to O
hide O
himself O
from O
that O
young O
man O
. O
A O
boy O
may O
lock O
his O
door O
, O
may O
be O
warm O
in O
bed O
, O
may O
tuck O
himself O
up O

may O
draw O
the O
clothes O
over O
his O
head O
, O
may O
think O
himself O
comfortable O
and O
safe O
, O
but O
that O
young O
man O
will O
softly O
creep O
and O
creep O
his O
way O
to O
him O
and O
tear O
him O
open O
. O
I O
am O
a O
keeping O
that O
young O
man O
from O
harming O
of O
you O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
, O
with O
great O
difficulty O
. O
I O
find O
it O
wery O
hard O
to O
hold O
that O
young O
man O
off O
of O
your O
inside O
. O
Now O
, O
what O
do O
you O
say O
? O
" O
I O
said O
that O
I O
would O
get O
him O
the O
file O
, O
and O
I O
would O
get O
him O
what O
broken O
bits O
of O
food O
I O
could O
, O
and O
I O
would O
come O
to O
him O
at O
the O
Battery O
, O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
" O
Say O
Lord O
strike O
you O
dead O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
! O
" O
said O
the O
man O
. O
I O
said O
so O
, O
and O
he O
took O
me O
down O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
" O
he O
pursued O
, O
" O
you O
remember O
what O
you O
've O
undertook O
, O
and O
you O
remember O
that O
young O
man O
, O
and O
you O
get O
home O
! O
" O
" O
Goo-good O
night O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
I O
faltered O
. O
" O
Much O
of O
that O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
glancing O
about O
him O
over O
the O
cold O
wet O
flat O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
was O
a O
frog O
. O
Or O
a O
eel O
! O
" O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
he O
hugged O
his O
shuddering O
body O
in O
both O
his O
arms O
, O
-- O
clasping O
himself O
, O
as O
if O
to O
hold O
himself O
together O
, O
-- O
and O
limped O
towards O
the O
low O
church O
wall O
. O
As O
I O
saw O
him O
go O
, O
picking O
his O
way O
among O
the O
nettles O
, O
and O
among O
the O
brambles O
that O
bound O
the O
green O
mounds O
, O
he O
looked O
in O
my O
young O
eyes O
as O
if O
he O
were O
eluding O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
dead O
people O
, O
stretching O
up O
cautiously O
out O
of O
their O
graves O
, O
to O
get O
a O
twist O
upon O
his O
ankle O
and O
pull O
him O
in O
. O
When O
he O
came O
to O
the O
low O
church O
wall O
, O
he O
got O
over O
it O
, O
like O
a O
man O
whose O
legs O
were O
numbed O
and O
stiff O
, O
and O
then O
turned O
round O
to O
look O
for O
me O
. O
When O
I O
saw O
him O
turning O
, O
I O
set O
my O
face O
towards O
home O
, O
and O
made O
the O
best O
use O
of O
my O
legs O
. O
But O
presently O
I O
looked O
over O
my O
shoulder O
, O
and O
saw O
him O
going O
on O
again O
towards O
the O
river O
, O
still O
hugging O
himself O
in O
both O
arms O
, O
and O
picking O
his O
way O
with O
his O
sore O
feet O
among O
the O
great O
stones O
dropped O
into O
the O
marshes O
here O
and O
there O
, O
for O
stepping-places O
when O
the O

hand O
and O
wrist O
were O
so O
finely O
formed O
that O
she PRON_PER
could O
wear O
sleeves O
not O
less O
bare O
of O
style O
than O
those O
in O
which O
the NOM_PER
Blessed NOM_PER
Virgin NOM_PER
appeared O
to O
Italian NOM_PER
painters NOM_PER
; O
and O
her PRON_PER
profile O
as O
well O
as O
her PRON_PER
stature O
and O
bearing O
seemed O
to O
gain O
the O
more O
dignity O
from O
her PRON_PER
plain O
garments O
, O
which O
by O
the O
side O
of O
provincial O
fashion O
gave O
her PRON_PER
the O
impressiveness O
of O
a O
fine O
quotation O
from O
the O
Bible O
, O
-- O
or O
from O
one O
of O
our NOM_PER
elder NOM_PER
poets NOM_PER
, O
-- O
in O
a O
paragraph O
of O
to-day O
's O
newspaper O
. O
She O
was O
usually O
spoken O
of O
as O
being O
remarkably O
clever O
, O
but O
with O
the O
addition O
that O
her O
sister O
Celia O
had O
more O
common-sense O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
Celia O
wore O
scarcely O
more O
trimmings O
; O
and O
it O
was O
only O
to O
close O
observers O
that O
her O
dress O
differed O
from O
her O
sister O
's O
, O
and O
had O
a O
shade O
of O
coquetry O
in O
its O
arrangements O
; O
for O
Miss O
Brooke O
's O
plain O
dressing O
was O
due O
to O
mixed O
conditions O
, O
in O
most O
of O
which O
her O
sister O
shared O
. O
The O
pride O
of O
being O
ladies O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
: O
the O
Brooke O
connections O
, O
though O
not O
exactly O
aristocratic O
, O
were O
unquestionably O
" O
good O
: O
" O
if O
you O
inquired O
backward O
for O
a O
generation O
or O
two O
, O
you O
would O
not O
find O
any O
yard-measuring O
or O
parcel-tying O
forefathers O
-- O
anything O
lower O
than O
an O
admiral O
or O
a O
clergyman O
; O
and O
there O
was O
even O
an O
ancestor O
discernible O
as O
a O
Puritan O
gentleman O
who O
served O
under O
Cromwell O
, O
but O
afterwards O
conformed O
, O
and O
managed O
to O
come O
out O
of O
all O
political O
troubles O
as O
the O
proprietor O
of O
a O
respectable O
family O
estate O
. O
Young O
women O
of O
such O
birth O
, O
living O
in O
a O
quiet O
country-house O
, O
and O
attending O
a O
village O
church O
hardly O
larger O
than O
a O
parlor O
, O
naturally O
regarded O
frippery O
as O
the O
ambition O
of O
a O
huckster O
's O
daughter O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
well-bred O
economy O
, O
which O
in O
those O
days O
made O
show O
in O
dress O
the O
first O
item O
to O
be O
deducted O
from O
, O
when O
any O
margin O
was O
required O
for O
expenses O
more O
distinctive O
of O
rank O
. O
Such O
reasons O
would O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
account O
for O
plain O
dress O
, O
quite O
apart O
from O
religious O
feeling O
; O
but O
in O
Miss O
Brooke O
's O
case O
, O
religion O
alone O
would O
have O
determined O
it O
; O
and O
Celia O
mildly O
acquiesced O
in O
all O
her O
sister O
's O
sentiments O
, O
only O
infusing O
them O
with O
that O
common-sense O
which O
is O
able O
to O
accept O
momentous O
doctrines O
without O
any O
eccentric O
agitation O
. O
Dorothea O
knew O
many O
passages O
of O
Pascal O
's O
Pensees O
and O
of O
Jeremy O
Taylor O
by O
heart O
; O
and O
to O
her O
the O
destinies O
of O
mankind O
, O
seen O
by O
the O
light O
of O
Christianity O
, O
made O
the O
solicitudes O
of O
feminine O
fashion O
appear O
an O
occupation O
for O
Bedlam O
. O
She O
could O
not O
reconcile O
the O
anxieties O
of O
a O
spiritual O
life O
involving O
eternal O
consequences O
, O
with O
a O
keen O
interest O
in O
gimp O
and O
artificial O
protrusions O
of O
drapery O
. O
Her O
mind O
was O
theoretic O
, O
and O
yearned O
by O
its O
nature O
after O
some O
lofty O
conception O
of O
the O
world O
which O
might O
frankly O
include O
the O
parish O
of O
Tipton O
and O
her O
own O
rule O
of O
conduct O
there O
; O
she O
was O
enamoured O
of O
intensity O
and O
greatness O
, O
and O
rash O
in O
embracing O
whatever O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
have O
those O
aspects O
; O
likely O
to O
seek O
martyrdom O
, O
to O
make O
retractations O
, O
and O
then O
to O
incur O
martyrdom O
after O
all O
in O
a O
quarter O
where O
she O
had O
not O
sought O
it O
. O
Certainly O
such O
elements O
in O
the O
character O
of O
a O
marriageable O
girl O
tended O
to O
interfere O
with O
her O
lot O
, O
and O
hinder O
it O
from O
being O
decided O
according O
to O
custom O
, O
by O
good O
looks O
, O
vanity O
, O
and O
merely O
canine O
affection O
. O
With O
all O
this O
, O
she O
, O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
sisters O
, O
was O
not O
yet O
twenty O
, O
and O
they O
had O
both O
been O
educated O
, O
since O
they O
were O
about O
twelve O
years O
old O
and O
had O
lost O
their O
parents O
, O
on O
plans O
at O
once O
narrow O
and O
promiscuous O
, O
first O
in O
an O
English O
family O
and O
afterwards O
in O
a O
Swiss O
family O
at O
Lausanne O
, O
their O
bachelor O
uncle O
and O
guardian O
trying O
in O
this O
way O
to O
remedy O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
their O
orphaned O
condition O
. O
It O
was O
hardly O
a O
year O
since O
they O
had O
come O
to O
live O
at O
Tipton O
Grange O
with O
their O
uncle O
, O
a O
man O
nearly O
sixty O
, O
of O
acquiescent O
temper O
, O
miscellaneous O
opinions O
, O
and O
uncertain O
vote O
. O
He O
had O
travelled O
in O
his O
younger O
years O
, O
and O
was O
held O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
county O
to O
have O
contracted O
a O
too O
rambling O
habit O
of O
mind O
. O
Mr. O
Brooke O
's O
conclusions O
were O
as O
difficult O
to O
predict O
as O
the O
weather O
: O
it O
was O
only O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
he O
would O
act O
with O
benevolent O
intentions O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
spend O
as O
little O
money O
as O
possible O
in O
carrying O
them O
out O
. O
For O
the O
most O
glutinously O
indefinite O
minds O
enclose O
some O
hard O
grains O
of O
habit O
; O
and O
a O
man O
has O
been O
seen O
lax O
about O
all O
his O
own O
interests O
except O
the O
retention O
of O
his O
snuff-box O
, O
concerning O
which O
he O
was O
watchful O
, O
suspicious O
, O
and O
greedy O
of O
clutch O
. O
In O
Mr. O
Brooke O
the O
hereditary O
strain O
of O
Puritan O
energy O
was O
clearly O
in O
abeyance O
; O
but O
in O
his O
niece O
Dorothea O
it O
glowed O
alike O
through O
faults O
and O
virtues O
, O
turning O
sometimes O
into O
impatience O
of O
her O
uncle O
's O
talk O
or O
his O
way O
of O
" O
letting O
things O
be O
" O
on O
his O
estate O
, O
and O
making O
her O
long O
all O
the O
more O
for O
the O
time O
when O
she O
would O
be O
of O
age O
and O
have O
some O
command O
of O
money O
for O
generous O
schemes O
. O
She O
was O
regarded O
as O
an O
heiress O
; O
for O
not O
only O
had O
the O
sisters O
seven O
hundred O
a-year O
each O
from O
their O
parents O
, O
but O
if O
Dorothea O
married O
and O
had O
a O
son O
, O
that O
son O
would O
inherit O
Mr. O
Brooke O
's O
estate O
, O
presumably O
worth O
about O
three O
thousand O
a-year O
-- O
a O
rental O
which O
seemed O
wealth O
to O
provincial O
families O
, O
still O
discussing O
Mr. O
Peel O
's O
late O
conduct O
on O
the O
Catholic O
question O
, O
innocent O
of O
future O
gold-fields O
, O
and O
of O
that O
gorgeous O
plutocracy O
which O
has O
so O
nobly O
exalted O
the O
necessities O
of O
genteel O
life O
. O
And O
how O
should O
Dorothea O
not O
marry O
? O
-- O
a O
girl O
so O
handsome O
and O
with O
such O
prospects O
? O
Nothing O
could O
hinder O
it O
but O
her O
love O
of O
extremes O
, O
and O
her O
insistence O
on O
regulating O
life O
according O
to O
notions O
which O
might O
cause O
a O
wary O
man O
to O
hesitate O
before O
he O
made O
her O
an O
offer O
, O
or O
even O
might O
lead O
her O
at O
last O
to O
refuse O
all O
offers O
. O
A O
young O
lady O
of O
some O
birth O
and O
fortune O
, O
who O
knelt O
suddenly O
down O
on O
a O
brick O
floor O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a O
sick O
laborer O
and O
prayed O
fervidly O
as O
if O
she O
thought O
herself O
living O
in O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Apostles O
-- O
who O
had O
strange O
whims O
of O
fasting O
like O
a O
Papist O
, O
and O
of O
sitting O
up O
at O
night O
to O
read O
old O
theological O
books O
! O
Such O
a O
wife O
might O
awaken O
you O
some O
fine O
morning O
with O
a O
new O
scheme O
for O
the O
application O
of O
her O
income O
which O
would O
interfere O
with O
political O
economy O
and O
the O
keeping O
of O
saddle-horses O
: O
a O
man O
would O
naturally O
think O
twice O
before O
he O
risked O
himself O
in O
such O
fellowship O
. O
Women O
were O
expected O
to O
have O
weak O
opinions O
; O
but O
the O
great O
safeguard O
of O
society O
and O
of O
domestic O
life O
was O
, O
that O
opinions O
were O
not O
acted O
on O
. O
Sane O
people O
did O
what O
their O
neighbors O
did O
, O
so O
that O
if O
any O
lunatics O
were O
at O
large O
, O
one O
might O
know O
and O
avoid O
them O
. O
The O
rural O
opinion O
about O
the O
new O
young O
ladies O
, O
even O
among O
the O
cottagers O
, O
was O
generally O
in O
favor O
of O
Celia O
, O
as O
being O
so O
amiable O
and O
innocent-looking O
, O
while O
Miss O
Brooke O
's O
large O
eyes O
seemed O
, O
like O
her O
religion O
, O
too O
unusual O
and O
striking O
. O
Poor O
Dorothea O
! O
compared O
with O
her O
, O
the O
innocent-looking O
Celia O
was O
knowing O
and O
worldly-wise O
; O
so O
much O
subtler O
is O
a O
human O
mind O
than O
the O
outside O
tissues O
which O
make O
a O
sort O
of O
blazonry O
or O
clock-face O
for O
it O
. O
Yet O
those O
who O
approached O
Dorothea O
, O
though O
prejudiced O
against O
her O
by O
this O
alarming O
hearsay O
, O
found O
that O
she O
had O
a O
charm O
unaccountably O
reconcilable O
with O
it O
. O
Most O
men O
thought O
her O
bewitching O
when O
she O
was O
on O
horseback O
. O
She O
loved O
the O
fresh O
air O
and O
the O
various O
aspects O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
when O
her O
eyes O
and O
cheeks O
glowed O
with O
mingled O
pleasure O
she O
looked O
very O
little O
like O
a O
devotee O
. O
Riding O
was O
an O
indulgence O
which O
she O
allowed O
herself O
in O
spite O
of O
conscientious O
qualms O
; O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
enjoyed O
it O
in O
a O
pagan O
sensuous O
way O
, O
and O
always O
looked O
forward O
to O
renouncing O
it O
. O
She O
was O
open O
, O
ardent O
, O
and O
not O
in O
the O
least O
self-admiring O
; O
indeed O
, O
it O
was O
pretty O
to O
see O
how O
her O
imagination O
adorned O
her O
sister O
Celia O
with O
attractions O
altogether O
superior O
to O
her O
own O
, O
and O
if O
any O
gentleman O
appeared O
to O
come O
to O
the O
Grange O
from O
some O
other O
motive O
than O
that O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Brooke O
, O
she O
concluded O
that O
he O
must O
be O
in O
love O
with O
Celia O
: O
Sir O
James O
Chettam O
, O
for O
example O
, O
whom O
she O
constantly O
considered O
from O
Celia O
's O
point O
of O
view O
, O
inwardly O
debating O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
good O
for O
Celia O
to O
accept O
him O
. O
That O
he O
should O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
suitor O
to O
herself O
would O
have O
seemed O
to O
her O
a O
ridiculous O
irrelevance O
. O
Dorothea O
, O
with O
all O
her O
eagerness O
to O
know O
the O
truths O
of O
life O
, O
retained O
very O
childlike O
ideas O
about O
marriage O
. O
She O
felt O
sure O
that O
she O
would O
have O
accepted O
the O
judicious O
Hooker O
, O
if O
she O
had O
been O
born O
in O
time O
to O
save O
him O
from O
that O
wretched O
mistake O
he O
made O
in O
matrimony O
; O
or O
John O
Milton O
when O
his O
blindness O
had O
come O
on O
; O
or O
any O
of O
the O
other O
great O
men O
whose O
odd O
habits O
it O
would O
have O
been O
glorious O
piety O
to O
endure O
; O
but O
an O
amiable O
handsome O
baronet O
, O
who O
said O
" O
Exactly O
" O
to O
her O
remarks O
even O
when O
she O
expressed O
uncertainty O
, O
-- O
how O
could O
he O
affect O
her O
as O
a O
lover O
? O
The O
really O
delightful O
marriage O
must O
be O
that O
where O
your O
husband O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
father O
, O
and O
could O
teach O
you O
even O
Hebrew O
, O
if O
you O
wished O
it O
. O
These O
peculiarities O
of O
Dorothea O
's O
character O
caused O
Mr. O
Brooke O
to O
be O
all O
the O
more O
blamed O
in O
neighboring O
families O
for O
not O
securing O
some O
middle-aged O
lady O
as O
guide O
and O
companion O
to O
his O
nieces O
. O
But O
he O
himself O
dreaded O
so O
much O
the O
sort O
of O
superior O
woman O
likely O
to O
be O
available O
for O
such O
a O
position O
, O
that O
he O
allowed O
himself O
to O
be O
dissuaded O
by O
Dorothea O
's O
objections O
, O
and O
was O
in O
this O
case O
brave O
enough O
to O
defy O
the O
world O
-- O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
Mrs. O
Cadwallader O
the O
Rector O
's O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
small O
group O
of O
gentry O
with O
whom O
he O
visited O
in O
the O
northeast O
corner O
of O
Loamshire O
. O
So O
Miss O
Brooke O
presided O
in O
her O
uncle O
's O
household O
, O
and O
did O
not O
at O
all O
dislike O
her O
new O
authority O
, O
with O
the O
homage O
that O
belonged O
to O
it O
. O
Sir O
James O
Chettam O
was O
going O
to O
dine O
at O
the O
Grange O
to-day O
with O
another O
gentleman O
whom O
the O
girls O
had O
never O
seen O
, O
and O
about O
whom O
Dorothea O
felt O
some O
venerating O
expectation O
. O
This O
was O
the O
Reverend O
Edward O
Casaubon O
, O
noted O
in O
the O
county O
as O
a O
man O
of O
profound O
learning O
, O
understood O
for O
many O
years O
to O
be O
engaged O
on O
a O
great O
work O
concerning O
religious O
history O
; O
also O
as O
a O
man O
of O
wealth O
enough O
to O
give O
lustre O
to O
his O
piety O
, O
and O
having O
views O
of O
his O
own O
which O
were O
to O
be O
more O
clearly O
ascertained O
on O
the O
publication O
of O
his O
book O
. O
His O
very O
name O
carried O
an O
impressiveness O
hardly O
to O
be O
measured O
without O
a O
precise O
chronology O
of O
scholarship O
. O
Early O
in O
the O
day O
Dorothea O
had O
returned O
from O
the O
infant O
school O
which O
she O
had O
set O
going O
in O
the O
village O
, O
and O
was O
taking O
her O
usual O
place O
in O
the O
pretty O
sitting-room O
which O
divided O
the O
bedrooms O
of O
the O
sisters O
, O
bent O
on O
finishing O
a O
plan O
for O
some O
buildings O
( O
a O
kind O
of O
work O
which O
she O
delighted O
in O
) O
, O
when O
Celia O
, O
who O
had O
been O
watching O
her O
with O
a O
hesitating O
desire O
to O
propose O
something O
, O
said O
-- O

Night O

The O

grew O

The O
tall O
pines O
lost O
their O
slimness O
and O
stood O
in O
wide O
blurred O
blotches O
all O
across O
the O
way O
, O
and O
a O
great O
shadowy O
bird O
arose O
, O

into O

heavy O
bundle O
and O
stood O
still O
, O
listening O
as O
the O
voice O
of O
crickets O
split O
the O
shadows O
and O
made O
the O
silence O
audible O
. O
A O
tear O
wandered O
down O
his PRON_PER
brown O
cheek O
. O
They PRON_PER
were O
at O
supper O
now O
, O
he PRON_PER
whispered O
-- O
the NOM_PER
father NOM_PER
and O
old NOM_PER
mother NOM_PER
, O
away O
back O
yonder O
beyond O
the O
night O
. O
They PRON_PER
were O
far O
away O
; O
they PRON_PER
would O
never O
be O
as O
near O
as O
once O
they PRON_PER
had O
been O
, O
for O
he PRON_PER
had O
stepped O
into O
the O
world O
. O
And O
the O
cat O
and O
Old PROP_PER
Billy PROP_PER
-- O
ah O
, O
but O
the O
world O
was O
a O
lonely O
thing O
, O
so O
wide O
and O
tall O
and O
empty O
! O
And O
so O
bare O
, O
so O
bitter O
bare O
! O
Somehow O
he PRON_PER
had O
never O
dreamed O
of O
the O
world O
as O
lonely O
before O
; O
he PRON_PER
had O
fared O
forth O
to O
beckoning O
hands O
and O
luring O
, O
and O
to O
the O
eager O
hum O
of O
human O
voices O
, O
as O
of O
some O
great O
, O
swelling O
music O
. O
Yet O
now O
he PRON_PER
was O
alone O
; O
the O
empty O
night O
was O
closing O
all O
about O
him PRON_PER
here O
in O
a O
strange O
land O
, O
and O
he PRON_PER
was O
afraid O
. O
The O
bundle O
with O
his PRON_PER
earthly O
treasure O
had O
hung O
heavy O
and O
heavier O
on O
his PRON_PER
shoulder O
; O
his PRON_PER
little O
horde O
of O
money O
was O
tightly O
wadded O
in O
his PRON_PER
sock O
, O
and O
the O
school O
lay O
hidden O
somewhere O
far O
away O
in O
the O
shadows O
. O
He PRON_PER
wondered O
how O
far O
it O
was O
; O
he PRON_PER
looked O
and O
harkened O
, O
starting O
at O
his PRON_PER
own O
heartbeats O
, O
and O
fearing O
more O
and O
more O
the O
long O
dark O
fingers O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Then O
of O
a O
sudden O
up O
from O
the O
darkness O
came O
music O
. O
It O
was O
human O
music O
, O
but O
of O
a O
wildness O
and O
a O
weirdness O
that O
startled O
the NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
as O
it O
fluttered O
and O
danced O
across O
the O
dull O
red O
waters O
of O
the O
swamp O
. O
He PRON_PER
hesitated O
, O
then O
impelled O
by O
some O
strange O
power O
, O
left O
the O
highway O
and O
slipped O
into O
the O
forest O
of O
the O
swamp O
, O
shrinking O
, O
yet O
following O
the O
song O
hungrily O
and O
half O
forgetting O
his PRON_PER
fear O
. O
A O
harsher O
, O
shriller O
note O
struck O
in O
as O
of O
many O
and O
ruder O
voices O
; O
but O
above O
it O
flew O
the O
first O
sweet O
music O
, O
birdlike O
, O
abandoned O
, O
and O
the NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
crept O
closer O
. O
The O
cabin O
crouched O
ragged O
and O
black O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
black O
waters O
. O
An O
old O
chimney O
leaned O
drunkenly O
against O
it O
, O
raging O
with O
fire O
and O
smoke O
, O
while O
through O
the O
chinks O
winked O
red O
gleams O
of O
warmth O
and O
wild O
cheer O
. O
With O
a O
revel O
of O
shouting O
and O
noise O
, O
the O
music O
suddenly O
ceased O
. O
Hoarse O
staccato O
cries O
and O
peals O
of O
laughter O
shook O
the O
old O
hut O
, O
and O
as O
the NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
stood O
there O
peering O
through O
the O
black O
trees O
, O
abruptly O
the O
door O
flew O
open O
and O
a O
flood O
of O
light O
illumined O
the O
wood O
. O
Amid O
this O
mighty O
halo O
, O
as O
on O
clouds O
of O
flame O
, O
a NOM_PER
girl NOM_PER
was O
dancing O
. O
She PRON_PER
was O
black O
, O
and O
lithe O
, O
and O
tall O
, O
and O
willowy O
. O
Her PRON_PER
garments O
twined O
and O
flew O
around O
the O
delicate O
moulding O
of O
her PRON_PER
dark O
, O
young O
, O
half-naked O
limbs O
. O
A O
heavy O
mass O
of O
hair O
clung O
motionless O
to O
her PRON_PER
wide O
forehead O
. O
Her PRON_PER
arms O
twirled O
and O
flickered O
, O
and O
body O
and O
soul O
seemed O
quivering O
and O
whirring O
in O
the O
poetry O
of O
her PRON_PER
motion O
. O
As O
she PRON_PER
danced O
she PRON_PER
sang O
. O
He PRON_PER
heard O
her PRON_PER
voice O
as O
before O
, O
fluttering O
like O
a O
bird O
's O
in O
the O
full O
sweetness O
of O
her PRON_PER
utter O
music O
. O
It O
was O
no O
tune O
nor O
melody O
, O
it O
was O
just O
formless O
, O
boundless O
music O
. O
The NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
forgot O
himself PRON_PER
and O
all O
the O
world O
besides O
. O
All O
his PRON_PER
darkness O
was O
sudden O
light O
; O
dazzled O
he PRON_PER
crept O
forward O
, O
bewildered O
, O
fascinated O
, O
until O
with O
one O
last O
wild O
whirl O
the NOM_PER
elf-girl NOM_PER
paused O
. O
The O
crimson O
light O
fell O
full O
upon O
the O
warm O
and O
velvet O
bronze O
of O
her PRON_PER
face O
-- O
her PRON_PER
midnight O
eyes O
were O
aglow O
, O
her PRON_PER
full O
purple O
lips O
apart O
, O
her PRON_PER
half O
hid O
bosom O
panting O
, O
and O
all O
the O
music O
dead O
. O
Involuntarily O
the NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
gave O
a O
gasping O
cry O
and O
awoke O
to O
swamp O
and O
night O
and O
fire O
, O
while O
a O
white O
face O
, O
drawn O
, O
red-eyed O
, O
peered O
outward O
from O
some O
hidden O
throng O
within O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
Who O
's O
that O
? O
" O
a O
harsh O
voice O
cried O
. O
" O
Where O
? O
" O
" O
Who O
is O
it O
? O
" O
and O
pale O
crowding O
faces O
blurred O
the O
light O
. O
The NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
wheeled O
blindly O
and O
fled O
in O
terror O
stumbling O
through O
the O
swamp O
, O
hearing O
strange O
sounds O
and O
feeling O
stealthy O
creeping O
hands O
and O
arms O
and O
whispering O
voices O
. O
On O
he PRON_PER
toiled O
in O
mad O
haste O
, O
struggling O
toward O
the O
road O
and O
losing O
it O
until O
finally O
beneath O
the O
shadows O
of O
a O
mighty O
oak O
he PRON_PER
sank O
exhausted O
. O
There O
he PRON_PER
lay O
a O
while O
trembling O
and O
at O
last O
drifted O
into O
dreamless O
sleep O
. O
It O
was O
morning O
when O
he PRON_PER
awoke O
and O
threw O
a O
startled O
glance O
upward O
to O
the O
twisted O
branches O
of O
the O
oak O
that O
bent O
above O
, O
sifting O
down O
sunshine O
on O
his PRON_PER
brown O
face O
and O
close O
curled O
hair O
. O
Slowly O
he PRON_PER
remembered O
the O
loneliness O
, O
the O
fear O
and O
wild O
running O
through O
the O
dark O
. O
He PRON_PER
laughed O
in O
the O
bold O
courage O
of O
day O
and O
stretched O
himself PRON_PER
. O
Then O
suddenly O
he PRON_PER
bethought O
him PRON_PER
again O
of O
that O
vision O
of O
the O
night O
-- O
the O
waving O
arms O
and O
flying O
limbs O
of O
the NOM_PER
girl NOM_PER
, O
and O
her PRON_PER
great O
black O
eyes O
looking O
into O
the O
night O
and O
calling O
him PRON_PER
. O
He PRON_PER
could O
hear O
her PRON_PER
now O
, O
and O
hear O
that O
wondrous O
savage O
music O
. O
Had O
it O
been O
real O
? O
Had O
he PRON_PER
dreamed O
? O
Or O
had O
it O
been O
some O
witch-vision O
of O
the O
night O
, O
come O
to O
tempt O
and O
lure O
him PRON_PER
to O
his PRON_PER
undoing O
? O
Where O
was O
that O
black O
and O
flaming O
cabin O
? O
Where O
was O
the NOM_PER
girl NOM_PER
-- O
the NOM_PER
soul NOM_PER
that NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
called NOM_PER
him NOM_PER
? O
_ O
She O
_ O
must O
have O
been O
real O
; O
she O
had O
to O
live O
and O
dance O
and O
sing O
; O
he O
must O
again O
look O
into O
the O
mystery O
of O
her O
great O
eyes O
. O
And O
he O
sat O
up O
in O
sudden O
determination O
, O
and O
, O
lo O
! O
gazed O
straight O
into O
the O
very O
eyes O
of O
his O
dreaming O
. O
She O
sat O
not O
four O
feet O
from O
him O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
great O
tree O
, O
her O
eyes O
now O
languorously O
abstracted O
, O
now O
alert O
and O
quizzical O
with O
mischief O
. O
She O
seemed O
but O
half-clothed O
, O
and O
her O
warm O
, O
dark O
flesh O
peeped O
furtively O
through O
the O
rent O
gown O
; O
her O
thick O
, O
crisp O
hair O
was O
frowsy O
and O
rumpled O
, O
and O
the O
long O
curves O
of O
her O
bare O
young O
arms O
gleamed O
in O
the O
morning O
sunshine O
, O
glowing O
with O
vigor O
and O
life O
. O
A O
little O
mocking O
smile O
came O
and O
sat O
upon O
her O
lips O
. O
" O
What O
you O
run O
for O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
, O
with O
dancing O
mischief O
in O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
Because O
-- O
" O
he O
hesitated O
, O
and O
his O
cheeks O
grew O
hot O
. O
" O
I O
knows O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
with O
impish O
glee O
, O
laughing O
low O
music O
. O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
he O
challenged O
, O
sturdily O
. O
" O
You O
was O
a-feared O
. O
" O
He O
bridled O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
reckon O
you O
'd O
be O
a-feared O
if O
you O
was O
caught O
out O
in O
the O
black O
dark O
all O
alone O
. O
" O
" O
Pooh O
! O
" O
she O
scoffed O
and O
hugged O
her O
knees O
. O
" O
Pooh O
! O
I O
've O
stayed O
out O
all O
alone O
heaps O
o O
' O
nights O
. O
" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
curious O
awe O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
you O
, O
" O
he O
asserted O
; O
but O
she O
tossed O
her O
head O
and O
her O
eyes O
grew O
scornful O
. O
" O
Who O
's O
a-feared O
of O
the O
dark O
? O
I O
love O
night O
. O
" O
Her O
eyes O
grew O
soft O
. O
He O
watched O
her O
silently O
, O
till O
, O
waking O
from O
her O
daydream O
, O
she O
abruptly O
asked O
: O
" O
Where O
you O
from O
? O
" O
" O
Georgia O
. O
" O
" O
Where O
's O
that O
? O
" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
in O
surprise O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
matter-of-fact O
. O
" O
It O
's O
away O
over O
yonder O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
. O
" O
Behind O
where O
the O
sun O
comes O
up O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
! O
" O
" O
Then O
it O
ai O
n't O
so O
far O
, O
" O
she O
declared O
. O
" O
I O
knows O
where O
the O
sun O
rises O
, O
and O
I O
knows O
where O
it O
sets O
. O
" O
She O
looked O
up O
at O
its O
gleaming O
splendor O
glinting O
through O
the O
leaves O
, O
and O
, O
noting O
its O
height O
, O
announced O
abruptly O
: O
" O
I O
' O
se O
hungry O
. O
" O
" O
So O
'm O
I O
, O
" O
answered O
the O
boy O
, O
fumbling O
at O
his O
bundle O
; O
and O
then O
, O
timidly O
: O
" O
Will O
you O
eat O
with O
me O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
and O
watched O
him O
with O
eager O
eyes O
. O
Untying O
the O
strips O
of O
cloth O
, O
he O
opened O
his O
box O
, O
and O
disclosed O
chicken O
and O
biscuits O
, O
ham O
and O
corn-bread O
. O
She O
clapped O
her O
hands O
in O
glee O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
any O
water O
near O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
Without O
a O
word O
, O
she O
bounded O
up O
and O
flitted O
off O
like O
a O
brown O
bird O
, O
gleaming O
dull-golden O
in O
the O
sun O
, O
glancing O
in O
and O
out O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
till O
she O
paused O
above O
a O
tiny O
black O
pool O
, O
and O
then O
came O
tripping O
and O
swaying O
back O
with O
hands O
held O
cupwise O
and O
dripping O
with O
cool O
water O
. O
" O
Drink O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
Obediently O
he O
bent O
over O
the O
little O
hands O
that O
seemed O
so O
soft O
and O
thin O
. O
He O
took O
a O
deep O
draught O
; O
and O
then O
to O
drain O
the O
last O
drop O
, O
his O
hands O
touched O
hers O
and O
the O
shock O
of O
flesh O
first O
meeting O
flesh O
startled O
them O
both O
, O
while O
the O
water O
rained O
through O
. O
A O
moment O
their O
eyes O
looked O
deep O
into O
each O
other O
's O
-- O
a O
timid O
, O
startled O
gleam O
in O
hers O
; O
a O
wonder O
in O
his O
. O
Then O
she O
said O
dreamily O
: O
" O
We O
' O
se O
known O
us O
all O
our O
lives O
, O
and O

" O
He O
hesitated O
. O
" O

" O
he O
slowly O
returned O
. O
And O
then O
, O
brightening O
, O
he O
asked O
gayly O
: O
" O

we O
'll O

friends O

" O
" O

" O
she O
said O
at O
last O
, O
slowly O
and O
solemnly O
, O
and O
another O
brief O
moment O
they O
stood O
still O
. O
Then O
the O
mischief O
danced O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
song O
bubbled O
on O
her O
lips O
. O
She O
hopped O
to O
the O
tree O
. O
" O
Come O
-- O
eat O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
And O
they O
nestled O
together O
amid O
the O
big O
black O
roots O
of O
the O
oak O
, O
laughing O
and O
talking O
while O
they O
ate O

" O

My O

the O

me O

The O

II O
One O
of O
the O
wildest O
of O
these O
stories O
related O
to O
a O
Yellow O
Diamond O
-- O
a O
famous O
gem O
in O
the O
native O
annals O
of O
India O
. O
The O
earliest O
known O
traditions O
describe O
the O
stone O
as O
having O
been O
set O
in O
the O
forehead O
of O
the O
four-handed O
Indian O
god O
who O
typifies O
the O
Moon O
. O
Partly O
from O
its O
peculiar O
colour O
, O
partly O
from O
a O
superstition O
which O
represented O
it O
as O
feeling O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
deity O
whom O
it O
adorned O
, O
and O
growing O
and O
lessening O
in O
lustre O
with O
the O
waxing O
and O
waning O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
it O
first O
gained O
the O
name O
by O
which O
it O
continues O
to O
be O
known O
in O
India O
to O
this O
day O
-- O
the O
name O
of O
THE O
MOONSTONE O
. O
A O
similar O
superstition O
was O
once O
prevalent O
, O
as O
I O
have O
heard O
, O
in O
ancient O
Greece O
and O
Rome O
; O
not O
applying O
, O
however O
( O
as O
in O
India O
) O
, O
to O
a O
diamond O
devoted O
to O
the O
service O
of O
a O
god O
, O
but O
to O
a O
semi-transparent O
stone O
of O
the O
inferior O
order O
of O
gems O
, O
supposed O
to O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
lunar O
influences O
-- O
the O
moon O
, O
in O
this O
latter O
case O
also O
, O
giving O
the O
name O
by O
which O
the O
stone O
is O
still O
known O
to O
collectors O
in O
our O
own O
time O
. O
The O
adventures O
of O
the O
Yellow O
Diamond O
begin O
with O
the O
eleventh O
century O
of O
the O
Christian O
era O
. O
At O
that O
date O
, O
the O
Mohammedan O
conqueror O
, O
Mahmoud O
of O
Ghizni O
, O
crossed O
India O
; O
seized O
on O
the O
holy O
city O
of O
Somnauth O
; O
and O
stripped O
of O
its O
treasures O
the O
famous O
temple O
, O
which O
had O
stood O
for O
centuries O
-- O
the O
shrine O
of O
Hindoo O
pilgrimage O
, O
and O
the O
wonder O
of O
the O
Eastern O
world O
. O
Of O
all O
the O
deities O
worshipped O
in O
the O
temple O
, O
the O
moon-god O
alone O
escaped O
the O
rapacity O
of O
the O
conquering O
Mohammedans O
. O
Preserved O
by O
three O
Brahmins O
, O
the O
inviolate O
deity O
, O
bearing O
the O
Yellow O
Diamond O
in O
its O
forehead O
, O
was O
removed O
by O
night O
, O
and O
was O
transported O
to O
the O
second O
of O
the O
sacred O
cities O
of O
India O
-- O
the O
city O
of O
Benares O
. O
Here O
, O
in O
a O
new O
shrine O
-- O
in O
a O
hall O
inlaid O
with O
precious O
stones O
, O
under O
a O
roof O
supported O
by O
pillars O
of O
gold O
-- O
the O
moon-god O
was O
set O
up O
and O
worshipped O
. O
Here O
, O
on O
the O
night O
when O
the O
shrine O
was O
completed O
, O
Vishnu O
the O
Preserver O
appeared O
to O
the O
three O
Brahmins O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
The O
deity O
breathed O
the O
breath O
of O
his O
divinity O
on O
the O
Diamond O
in O
the O
forehead O
of O
the O
god O
. O
And O
the O
Brahmins O
knelt O
and O
hid O
their O
faces O
in O
their O
robes O
. O
The O
deity O
commanded O
that O
the O
Moonstone O
should O
be O
watched O
, O
from O
that O
time O
forth O
, O
by O
three O
priests O
in O
turn O
, O
night O
and O
day O
, O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
generations O
of O
men O
. O
And O
the O
Brahmins O
heard O
, O
and O
bowed O
before O
his O
will O
. O
The O
deity O
predicted O
certain O
disaster O
to O
the O
presumptuous O
mortal O
who O
laid O
hands O
on O
the O
sacred O
gem O
, O
and O
to O
all O
of O
his O
house O
and O
name O
who O
received O
it O
after O
him O
. O
And O
the O
Brahmins O
caused O
the O
prophecy O
to O
be O
written O
over O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
shrine O
in O
letters O
of O
gold O
. O
One O
age O
followed O
another O
-- O
and O
still O
, O
generation O
after O
generation O
, O
the O
successors O
of O
the O
three O
Brahmins O
watched O
their O
priceless O
Moonstone O
, O
night O
and O
day O
. O
One O
age O
followed O
another O
until O
the O
first O
years O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
Christian O
century O
saw O
the O
reign O
of O
Aurungzebe O
, O
Emperor O
of O
the O
Moguls O
. O
At O
his O
command O
havoc O
and O
rapine O
were O
let O
loose O
once O
more O
among O
the O
temples O
of O
the O
worship O
of O
Brahmah O
. O
The O
shrine O
of O
the O
four-handed O
god O
was O
polluted O
by O
the O
slaughter O
of O
sacred O
animals O
; O
the O
images O
of O
the O
deities O
were O
broken O
in O
pieces O
; O
and O
the O
Moonstone O
was O
seized O
by O
an O
officer O
of O
rank O
in O
the O
army O
of O
Aurungzebe O
. O
Powerless O
to O
recover O
their O
lost O
treasure O
by O
open O
force O
, O
the O
three O
guardian O
priests O
followed O
and O
watched O
it O
in O
disguise O
. O
The O
generations O
succeeded O
each O
other O
; O
the O
warrior O
who O
had O
committed O
the O
sacrilege O
perished O
miserably O
; O
the O
Moonstone O
passed O
( O
carrying O
its O
curse O
with O
it O
) O
from O
one O
lawless O
Mohammedan O
hand O
to O
another O
; O
and O
still O
, O
through O
all O
chances O
and O
changes O
, O
the O
successors O
of O
the O
three O
guardian O
priests O
kept O
their O
watch O
, O
waiting O
the O
day O
when O
the O
will O
of O
Vishnu O
the O
Preserver O
should O
restore O
to O
them O
their O
sacred O
gem O
. O
Time O
rolled O
on O
from O
the O
first O
to O
the O
last O
years O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
Christian O
century O
. O
The O
Diamond O
fell O
into O
the O
possession O
of O
Tippoo O
, O
Sultan O
of O
Seringapatam O
, O
who O
caused O
it O
to O
be O
placed O
as O
an O
ornament O
in O
the O
handle O
of O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
who O
commanded O
it O
to O
be O
kept O
among O
the O
choicest O
treasures O
of O
his O
armoury O
. O
Even O
then O
-- O
in O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
Sultan O
himself O
-- O
the O
three O
guardian O
priests O
still O
kept O
their O
watch O
in O
secret O
. O
There O
were O
three O
officers O
of O
Tippoo O
’s O
household O
, O
strangers O
to O
the O
rest O
, O
who O
had O
won O
their O
master O
’s O
confidence O
by O
conforming O
, O
or O
appearing O
to O
conform O
, O
to O
the O
Mussulman O
faith O
; O
and O
to O
those O
three O
men O
report O
pointed O
as O
the O
three O
priests O
in O
disguise O
. O
III O
So O
, O
as O
told O
in O
our O
camp O
, O
ran O
the O
fanciful O
story O
of O
the O
Moonstone O
. O
It O
made O
no O
serious O
impression O
on O
any O
of O
us O
except O
my O
cousin O
-- O
whose O
love O
of O
the O
marvellous O
induced O
him O
to O
believe O
it O
. O
On O
the O
night O
before O
the O
assault O
on O
Seringapatam O
, O
he O
was O
absurdly O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
and O
with O
others O
, O
for O
treating O
the O
whole O
thing O
as O
a O
fable O
. O
A O
foolish O
wrangle O
followed O
; O
and O
Herncastle O
’s O
unlucky O
temper O
got O
the O
better O
of O
him O
. O
He O
declared O
, O
in O
his O
boastful O
way O
, O
that O
we O
should O
see O
the O
Diamond O
on O
his O
finger O
, O
if O
the O
English O
army O
took O
Seringapatam O
. O
The O
sally O
was O
saluted O
by O
a O
roar O
of O
laughter O
, O
and O
there O
, O
as O
we O
all O
thought O
that O
night O
, O
the O
thing O
ended O
. O
Let O
me O
now O
take O
you O
on O
to O
the O
day O
of O
the O
assault O
. O
My O
cousin O
and O
I O
were O
separated O
at O
the O
outset O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
when O
we O
forded O
the O
river O
; O
when O
we O
planted O
the O
English O
flag O
in O
the O
first O
breach O
; O
when O
we O
crossed O
the O
ditch O
beyond O
; O
and O
, O
fighting O
every O
inch O
of O
our O
way O
, O
entered O
the O
town O
. O
It O
was O
only O
at O
dusk O
, O
when O
the O
place O
was O
ours O
, O
and O
after O
General O
Baird O
himself O
had O
found O
the O
dead O
body O
of O
Tippoo O
under O
a O
heap O
of O
the O
slain O
, O
that O
Herncastle O
and O
I O
met O
. O
We O
were O
each O
attached O
to O
a O
party O
sent O
out O
by O
the O
general O
’s O
orders O
to O
prevent O
the O
plunder O
and O
confusion O
which O
followed O
our O
conquest O
. O
The O
camp-followers O
committed O
deplorable O
excesses O
; O
and O
, O
worse O
still O
, O
the O
soldiers O
found O
their O
way O
, O
by O
a O
guarded O
door O
, O
into O
the O
treasury O
of O
the O
Palace O
, O
and O
loaded O
themselves O
with O
gold O
and O
jewels O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
court O
outside O
the O
treasury O
that O
my O
cousin O
and O
I O
met O
, O
to O
enforce O
the O
laws O
of O
discipline O
on O
our O
own O
soldiers O
. O
Herncastle O
’s O
fiery O
temper O
had O
been O
, O
as O
I O
could O
plainly O
see O
, O
exasperated O
to O
a O
kind O
of O
frenzy O
by O
the O
terrible O
slaughter O
through O
which O
we O
had O
passed O
. O
He O
was O
very O
unfit O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
to O
perform O
the O
duty O
that O
had O
been O
entrusted O
to O
him O
. O
There O
was O
riot O
and O
confusion O
enough O
in O
the O
treasury O
, O
but O
no O
violence O
that O
I O
saw O
. O
The O
men O
( O
if O
I O
may O
use O
such O
an O
expression O
) O
disgraced O
themselves O
good-humouredly O
. O
All O
sorts O
of O
rough O
jests O
and O
catchwords O
were O
bandied O
about O
among O
them O
; O
and O
the O
story O
of O
the O
Diamond O
turned O
up O
again O
unexpectedly O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
mischievous O
joke O
. O
" O
Who O
’s O
got O
the O
Moonstone O
? O
" O
was O
the O
rallying O
cry O
which O
perpetually O
caused O
the O
plundering O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
stopped O
in O
one O
place O
, O
to O
break O
out O
in O
another O
. O
While O
I O
was O
still O
vainly O
trying O
to O
establish O
order O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
frightful O
yelling O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
courtyard O
, O
and O
at O
once O
ran O
towards O
the O
cries O
, O
in O
dread O
of O
finding O
some O
new O
outbreak O
of O
the O
pillage O
in O
that O
direction O
. O
I O
got O
to O
an O
open O
door O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
bodies O
of O
two O
Indians O
( O
by O
their O
dress O
, O
as O
I O
guessed O
, O
officers O
of O
the O
palace O
) O
lying O
across O
the O
entrance O
, O
dead O
. O
A O
cry O
inside O
hurried O
me O
into O
a O
room O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
serve O
as O
an O
armoury O
. O
A O
third O
Indian O
, O
mortally O
wounded O
, O
was O
sinking O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
a O
man O
whose O
back O
was O
towards O
me O
. O
The O
man O
turned O
at O
the O
instant O
when O
I O
came O
in O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
John O
Herncastle O
, O
with O
a O
torch O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
a O
dagger O
dripping O
with O
blood O
in O
the O
other O
. O
A O
stone O
, O
set O
like O
a O
pommel O
, O
in O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dagger O
’s O
handle O
, O
flashed O
in O
the O
torchlight O
, O
as O
he O
turned O
on O
me O
, O
like O
a O
gleam O
of O
fire O
. O
The O
dying O
Indian O
sank O
to O
his O
knees O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
dagger O
in O
Herncastle O
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
his O
native O
language O
-- O
" O
The O
Moonstone O
will O
have O
its O
vengeance O
yet O
on O
you O
and O
yours O
! O
" O
He O
spoke O
those O
words O
, O
and O
fell O
dead O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Before O
I O
could O
stir O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
the O
men O
who O
had O
followed O
me O
across O
the O
courtyard O
crowded O
in O
. O
My O
cousin O
rushed O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
like O
a O
madman O
. O
" O
Clear O
the O
room O
! O
" O
he O
shouted O
to O
me O
, O
" O
and O
set O
a O
guard O
on O
the O
door O
! O
" O
The O
men O
fell O
back O
as O
he O
threw O
himself O
on O
them O
with O
his O
torch O
and O
his O
dagger O
. O
I O
put O
two O
sentinels O
of O
my O
own O
company O
, O
on O
whom O
I O
could O
rely O
, O
to O
keep O
the O
door O
. O
Through O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
night O
, O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
of O
my O
cousin O
. O
Early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
plunder O
still O
going O
on O
, O
General O
Baird O
announced O
publicly O
by O
beat O
of O
drum O
, O
that O
any O
thief O
detected O
in O
the O
fact O
, O
be O
he O
whom O
he O
might O
, O
should O
be O
hung O
. O
The O
provost-marshal O
was O
in O
attendance O
, O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
General O
was O
in O
earnest O
; O
and O
in O
the O
throng O
that O
followed O
the O
proclamation O
, O
Herncastle O
and O
I O
met O
again O
. O
He O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Good O
morning O
. O
" O
I O
waited O
before O
I O
gave O
him O
my O
hand O
in O
return O
. O
" O
Tell O
me O
first O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
how O
the O
Indian O
in O
the O
armoury O
met O
his O
death O
, O
and O
what O
those O
last O
words O
meant O
, O
when O
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
dagger O
in O
your O
hand O
. O
" O
" O
The O
Indian O
met O
his O
death O
, O
as O
I O
suppose O
, O
by O
a O
mortal O
wound O
, O
" O
said O
Herncastle O
. O
" O
What O

rich NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
comfortable NOM_PER
home NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
happy NOM_PER
disposition NOM_PER
, O
seemed O
to O
unite O
some O
of O
the O
best O
blessings O
of O
existence O
; O
and O
had O
lived O
nearly O
twenty-one O
years O
in O
the O
world O
with O
very O
little O
to O
distress O
or O
vex O
her PRON_PER
. O
She PRON_PER
was O
the NOM_PER
youngest NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
two NOM_PER
daughters NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
most NOM_PER

; O
and O
had O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
marriage O
, O
been O
mistress O
of O
his O
house O
from O
a O
very O
early O
period O
. O
Her O
mother O
had O
died O
too O
long O
ago O
for O
her O
to O
have O
more O
than O
an O
indistinct O
remembrance O
of O
her O
caresses O
; O
and O
her O
place O
had O
been O
supplied O
by O
an O
excellent O
woman O
as O
governess O
, O
who O
had O
fallen O
little O
short O
of O
a O
mother O
in O
affection O
. O
Sixteen O
years O
had O
Miss O
Taylor O
been O
in O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
's O
family O
, O
less O
as O
a O
governess O
than O
a O
friend O
, O
very O
fond O
of O
both O
daughters O
, O
but O
particularly O
of O
Emma O
. O
Between O
_ O
them O
_ O
it O
was O
more O
the O
intimacy O
of O
sisters O
. O
Even O
before O
Miss O
Taylor O
had O
ceased O
to O
hold O
the O
nominal O
office O
of O
governess O
, O
the O
mildness O
of O
her O
temper O
had O
hardly O
allowed O
her O
to O
impose O
any O
restraint O
; O
and O
the O
shadow O
of O
authority O
being O
now O
long O
passed O
away O
, O
they O
had O
been O
living O
together O
as O
friend O
and O
friend O
very O
mutually O
attached O
, O
and O
Emma O
doing O
just O
what O
she O
liked O
; O
highly O
esteeming O
Miss O
Taylor O
's O
judgment O
, O
but O
directed O
chiefly O
by O
her O
own O
. O
The O
real O
evils O
, O
indeed O
, O
of O
Emma O
's O
situation O
were O
the O
power O
of O
having O
rather O
too O
much O
her O
own O
way O
, O
and O
a O
disposition O
to O
think O
a O
little O
too O
well O
of O
herself O
; O
these O
were O
the O
disadvantages O
which O
threatened O
alloy O
to O
her O
many O
enjoyments O
. O
The O
danger O
, O
however O
, O
was O
at O
present O
so O
unperceived O
, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
rank O
as O
misfortunes O
with O
her O
. O
Sorrow O
came O
-- O
a O
gentle O
sorrow O
-- O
but O
not O
at O
all O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
any O
disagreeable O
consciousness O
. O
-- O
Miss O
Taylor O
married O
. O
It O
was O
Miss O
Taylor O
's O
loss O
which O
first O
brought O
grief O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
wedding-day O
of O
this O
beloved O
friend O
that O
Emma O
first O
sat O
in O
mournful O
thought O
of O
any O
continuance O
. O
The O
wedding O
over O
, O
and O
the O
bride-people O
gone O
, O
her O
father O
and O
herself O
were O
left O
to O
dine O
together O
, O
with O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
third O
to O
cheer O
a O
long O
evening O
. O
Her O
father O
composed O
himself O
to O
sleep O
after O
dinner O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
she O
had O
then O
only O
to O
sit O
and O
think O
of O
what O
she O
had O
lost O
. O
The O
event O
had O
every O
promise O
of O
happiness O
for O
her O
friend O
. O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
a O
man O
of O
unexceptionable O
character O
, O
easy O
fortune O
, O
suitable O
age O
, O
and O
pleasant O
manners O
; O
and O
there O
was O
some O
satisfaction O
in O
considering O
with O
what O
self-denying O
, O
generous O
friendship O
she O
had O
always O
wished O
and O
promoted O
the O
match O
; O
but O
it O
was O
a O
black O
morning O
's O
work O
for O
her O
. O
The O
want O
of O
Miss O
Taylor O
would O
be O
felt O
every O
hour O
of O
every O
day O
. O
She O
recalled O
her O
past O
kindness O
-- O
the O
kindness O
, O
the O
affection O
of O
sixteen O
years O
-- O
how O
she O
had O
taught O
and O
how O
she O
had O
played O
with O
her O
from O
five O
years O
old O
-- O
how O
she O
had O
devoted O
all O
her O
powers O
to O
attach O
and O
amuse O
her O
in O
health O
-- O
and O
how O
nursed O
her O
through O
the O
various O
illnesses O
of O
childhood O
. O
A O
large O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
was O
owing O
here O
; O
but O
the O
intercourse O
of O
the O
last O
seven O
years O
, O
the O
equal O
footing O
and O
perfect O
unreserve O
which O
had O
soon O
followed O
Isabella O
's O
marriage O
, O
on O
their O
being O
left O
to O
each O
other O
, O
was O
yet O
a O
dearer O
, O
tenderer O
recollection O
. O
She O
had O
been O
a O
friend O
and O
companion O
such O
as O
few O
possessed O
: O
intelligent O
, O
well-informed O
, O
useful O
, O
gentle O
, O
knowing O
all O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
family O
, O
interested O
in O
all O
its O
concerns O
, O
and O
peculiarly O
interested O
in O
herself O
, O
in O
every O
pleasure O
, O
every O
scheme O
of O
hers O
-- O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
speak O
every O
thought O
as O
it O
arose O
, O
and O
who O
had O
such O
an O
affection O
for O
her O
as O
could O
never O
find O
fault O
. O
How O
was O
she O
to O
bear O
the O
change O
? O
-- O
It O
was O
true O
that O
her O
friend O
was O
going O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them O
; O
but O
Emma O
was O
aware O
that O
great O
must O
be O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
Mrs. O
Weston O
, O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them O
, O
and O
a O
Miss O
Taylor O
in O
the O
house O
; O
and O
with O
all O
her O
advantages O
, O
natural O
and O
domestic O
, O
she O
was O
now O
in O
great O
danger O
of O
suffering O
from O
intellectual O
solitude O
. O
She O
dearly O
loved O
her O
father O
, O
but O
he O
was O
no O
companion O
for O
her O
. O
He O
could O
not O
meet O
her O
in O
conversation O
, O
rational O
or O
playful O
. O
The O
evil O
of O
the O
actual O
disparity O
in O
their O
ages O
( O
and O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
not O
married O
early O
) O
was O
much O
increased O
by O
his O
constitution O
and O
habits O
; O
for O
having O
been O
a O
valetudinarian O
all O
his O
life O
, O
without O
activity O
of O
mind O
or O
body O
, O
he O
was O
a O
much O
older O
man O
in O
ways O
than O
in O
years O
; O
and O
though O
everywhere O
beloved O
for O
the O
friendliness O
of O
his O
heart O
and O
his O
amiable O
temper O
, O
his O
talents O
could O
not O
have O
recommended O
him O
at O
any O
time O
. O
Her O
sister O
, O
though O
comparatively O
but O
little O
removed O
by O
matrimony O
, O
being O
settled O
in O
London O
, O
only O
sixteen O
miles O
off O
, O
was O
much O
beyond O
her O
daily O
reach O
; O
and O
many O
a O
long O
October O
and O
November O
evening O
must O
be O
struggled O
through O
at O
Hartfield O
, O
before O
Christmas O
brought O
the O
next O
visit O
from O
Isabella O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
their O
little O
children O
, O
to O
fill O
the O
house O
, O
and O
give O
her O
pleasant O
society O
again O
. O
Highbury O
, O
the O
large O
and O
populous O
village O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
a O
town O
, O
to O
which O
Hartfield O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
separate O
lawn O
, O
and O
shrubberies O
, O
and O
name O
, O
did O
really O
belong O
, O
afforded O
her O
no O
equals O
. O
The O
Woodhouses O
were O
first O
in O
consequence O
there O
. O
All O
looked O
up O
to O
them O
. O
She O
had O
many O
acquaintance O
in O
the O
place O
, O
for O
her O
father O
was O
universally O
civil O
, O
but O
not O
one O
among O
them O
who O
could O
be O
accepted O
in O
lieu O
of O
Miss O
Taylor O
for O
even O
half O
a O
day O
. O
It O
was O
a O
melancholy O
change O
; O
and O
Emma O
could O
not O
but O
sigh O
over O
it O
, O
and O
wish O
for O
impossible O
things O
, O
till O
her O
father O
awoke O
, O
and O
made O
it O
necessary O
to O
be O
cheerful O
. O
His O
spirits O
required O
support O
. O
He O
was O
a O
nervous O
man O
, O
easily O
depressed O
; O
fond O
of O
every O
body O
that O
he O
was O
used O
to O
, O
and O
hating O
to O
part O
with O
them O
; O
hating O
change O
of O
every O
kind O
. O
Matrimony O
, O
as O
the O
origin O
of O
change O
, O
was O
always O
disagreeable O
; O
and O
he O
was O
by O
no O
means O
yet O
reconciled O
to O
his O
own O
daughter O
's O
marrying O
, O
nor O
could O
ever O
speak O
of O
her O
but O
with O
compassion O
, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
entirely O
a O
match O
of O
affection O
, O
when O
he O
was O
now O
obliged O
to O
part O
with O
Miss O
Taylor O
too O
; O
and O
from O
his O
habits O
of O
gentle O
selfishness O
, O
and O
of O
being O
never O
able O
to O
suppose O
that O
other O
people O
could O
feel O
differently O
from O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
very O
much O
disposed O
to O
think O
Miss O
Taylor O
had O
done O
as O
sad O
a O
thing O
for O
herself O
as O
for O
them O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
a O
great O
deal O
happier O
if O
she O
had O
spent O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life O
at O
Hartfield O
. O
Emma O
smiled O
and O
chatted O
as O
cheerfully O
as O
she O
could O
, O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
such O
thoughts O
; O
but O
when O
tea O
came O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
him O
not O
to O
say O
exactly O
as O
he O
had O
said O
at O
dinner O
, O
" O
Poor O
Miss O
Taylor O
! O
-- O
I O
wish O
she O
were O
here O
again O
. O
What O
a O
pity O
it O
is O
that O
Mr. O
Weston O
ever O
thought O
of O
her O
! O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
papa O
; O
you O
know O
I O
can O
not O
. O
Mr. O
Weston O
is O
such O
a O
good-humoured O
, O
pleasant O
, O
excellent O
man O
, O
that O
he O
thoroughly O
deserves O
a O
good O
wife O
; O
-- O
and O
you O
would O
not O
have O
had O
Miss O
Taylor O
live O
with O
us O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
bear O
all O
my O
odd O
humours O
, O
when O
she O
might O
have O
a O
house O
of O
her O
own O
? O
" O
" O
A O
house O
of O
her O
own O
! O
-- O
But O
where O
is O
the O
advantage O
of O
a O
house O
of O
her O
own O
? O
This O
is O
three O
times O
as O
large O
. O
-- O
And O
you O
have O
never O
any O
odd O
humours O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O
" O
How O
often O
we O
shall O
be O
going O
to O
see O
them O
, O
and O
they O
coming O
to O
see O
us O
! O
-- O
We O
shall O
be O
always O
meeting O
! O
_ O
We O
_ O
must O
begin O
; O
we O
must O
go O
and O
pay O
wedding O
visit O
very O
soon O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
how O
am O
I O
to O
get O
so O
far O
? O
Randalls O
is O
such O
a O
distance O
. O
I O
could O
not O
walk O
half O
so O
far O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
papa O
, O
nobody O
thought O
of O
your O
walking O
. O
We O
must O
go O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
" O
" O
The O
carriage O
! O
But O
James O
will O
not O
like O
to O
put O
the O
horses O
to O
for O
such O
a O
little O
way O
; O
-- O
and O
where O
are O
the O
poor O
horses O
to O
be O
while O
we O
are O
paying O
our O
visit O
? O
" O
" O
They O
are O
to O
be O
put O
into O
Mr. O
Weston O
's O
stable O
, O
papa O
. O
You O
know O
we O
have O
settled O
all O
that O
already O
. O
We O
talked O
it O
all O
over O
with O
Mr. O
Weston O
last O
night O
. O
And O
as O
for O
James O
, O
you O
may O
be O
very O
sure O
he O
will O
always O
like O
going O
to O
Randalls O
, O
because O
of O
his O
daughter O
's O
being O
housemaid O
there O
. O
I O
only O
doubt O
whether O
he O
will O
ever O
take O
us O
anywhere O
else O
. O
That O
was O
your O
doing O
, O
papa O
. O
You O
got O
Hannah O
that O
good O
place O
. O
Nobody O
thought O
of O
Hannah O
till O
you O
mentioned O
her O
-- O
James O
is O
so O
obliged O
to O
you O
! O
" O
" O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
I O
did O
think O
of O
her O
. O
It O
was O
very O
lucky O
, O
for O
I O
would O
not O
have O
had O
poor O
James O
think O
himself O
slighted O
upon O
any O
account O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
make O
a O
very O
good O
servant O
: O
she O
is O
a O
civil O
, O
pretty-spoken O
girl O
; O
I O
have O
a O
great O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
Whenever O
I O
see O
her O
, O
she O
always O
curtseys O
and O
asks O
me O
how O
I O
do O
, O
in O
a O
very O
pretty O
manner O
; O
and O
when O
you O
have O
had O
her O
here O
to O
do O
needlework O
, O
I O
observe O
she O
always O
turns O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
the O
right O
way O
and O
never O
bangs O
it O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
be O
an O
excellent O
servant O
; O
and O
it O
will O
be O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
poor O
Miss O
Taylor O
to O
have O
somebody O
about O
her O
that O
she O
is O
used O
to O
see O
. O
Whenever O
James O
goes O
over O
to O
see O
his O
daughter O
, O
you O
know O
, O
she O
will O
be O
hearing O
of O
us O
. O
He O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
her O
how O
we O
all O
are O
. O
" O
Emma O
spared O
no O
exertions O
to O
maintain O
this O
happier O
flow O
of O
ideas O
, O
and O
hoped O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
backgammon O
, O
to O
get O
her O
father O
tolerably O
through O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
be O
attacked O
by O
no O
regrets O
but O
her O
own O
. O
The O
backgammon-table O
was O
placed O
; O
but O
a O
visitor O
immediately O
afterwards O
walked O
in O
and O
made O
it O
unnecessary O
. O
Mr. O
Knightley O
, O
a O
sensible O
man O
about O
seven O
or O
eight-and-thirty O
, O
was O
not O
only O
a O
very O
old O
and O
intimate O
friend O
of O
the O
family O
, O
but O
particularly O
connected O
with O
it O
, O
as O
the O
elder O
brother O
of O
Isabella O
's O
husband O
. O
He O
lived O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
Highbury O
, O
was O
a O
frequent O
visitor O
, O
and O
always O
welcome O
, O
and O
at O
this O
time O
more O
welcome O
than O
usual O
, O
as O
coming O
directly O
from O
their O
mutual O
connexions O
in O
London O
. O
He O
had O
returned O
to O
a O
late O
dinner O
, O
after O
some O
days O
' O
absence O
, O
and O
now O
walked O
up O
to O
Hartfield O
to O
say O
that O
all O
were O
well O
in O
Brunswick O
Square O
. O
It O
was O
a O
happy O
circumstance O
, O
and O
animated O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
for O
some O
time O
. O
Mr. O
Knightley O
had O
a O
cheerful O
manner O

which O
always O
did O
him O
good O
; O
and O
his O
many O
inquiries O
after O
" O
poor O
Isabella O
" O
and O
her O
children O
were O
answered O
most O
satisfactorily O
. O
When O
this O
was O
over O
, O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
gratefully O
observed O
, O
" O
It O
is O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
, O
Mr. O
Knightley O
, O
to O
come O
out O
at O
this O
late O
hour O
to O
call O
upon O
us O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
must O
have O
had O
a O
shocking O
walk O

" O
" O

I O
A O
green O
and O
yellow O
parrot O
, O
which O
hung O
in O
a O
cage O
outside O
the O
door O
, O
kept O
repeating O
over O
and O
over O
: O
" O
Allez O
vous-en O
! O
Allez O
vous-en O
! O
Sapristi O
! O
That O
's O
all O
right O
! O
" O
He O
could O
speak O
a O
little O
Spanish O
, O
and O
also O
a O
language O
which O
nobody NOM_PER
understood O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
the O
mocking-bird O
that O
hung O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
door O
, O
whistling O
his O
fluty O
notes O
out O
upon O
the O
breeze O
with O
maddening O
persistence O
. O
Mr. PROP_PER
Pontellier PROP_PER
, O
unable O
to O
read O
his PRON_PER
newspaper O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
comfort O
, O
arose O
with O
an O
expression O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
disgust O
. O
He PRON_PER
walked O
down O
the O
gallery O
and O
across O
the O
narrow O
" O
bridges O
" O
which O
connected O
the O
Lebrun O
cottages O
one O
with O
the O
other O
. O
He PRON_PER
had O
been O
seated O
before O
the O
door O
of O
the O
main O
house O
. O
The O
parrot O
and O
the O
mockingbird O
were O
the O
property O
of O
Madame PROP_PER
Lebrun PROP_PER
, O
and O
they O
had O
the O
right O
to O
make O
all O
the O
noise O
they O
wished O
. O
Mr. PROP_PER
Pontellier PROP_PER
had O
the O
privilege O
of O
quitting O
their PRON_PER
society O
when O
they PRON_PER
ceased O
to O
be O
entertaining O
. O
He PRON_PER
stopped O
before O
the O
door O
of O
his PRON_PER
own O
cottage O
, O
which O
was O
the O
fourth O
one O
from O
the O
main O
building O
and O
next O
to O
the O
last O
. O
Seating O
himself PRON_PER
in O
a O
wicker O
rocker O
which O
was O
there O
, O
he PRON_PER
once O
more O
applied O
himself PRON_PER
to O
the O
task O
of O
reading O
the O
newspaper O
. O
The O
day O
was O
Sunday O
; O
the O
paper O
was O
a O
day O
old O
. O
The O
Sunday O
papers O
had O
not O
yet O
reached O
Grand O
Isle O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
already O
acquainted O
with O
the O
market O
reports O
, O
and O
he PRON_PER
glanced O
restlessly O
over O
the O
editorials O
and O
bits O
of O
news O
which O
he PRON_PER
had O
not O
had O
time O
to O
read O
before O
quitting O
New O
Orleans O
the O
day O
before O
. O
Mr. PROP_PER
Pontellier PROP_PER
wore O
eye-glasses O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
forty NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
medium NOM_PER
height NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
rather NOM_PER
slender NOM_PER

; O
he PRON_PER
stooped O
a O
little O

His PRON_PER
hair O
was O
brown O
and O
straight O
, O
parted O
on O
one O
side O
. O
His PRON_PER
beard O
was O
neatly O
and O
closely O
trimmed O
. O
Once O
in O
a O
while O
he PRON_PER
withdrew O
his PRON_PER
glance O
from O
the O
newspaper O
and O
looked O
about O
him PRON_PER
. O
There O
was O
more O
noise O
than O
ever O
over O
at O
the O
house O
. O
The O
main O
building O
was O
called O
" O
the O
house O
, O
" O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
the O
cottages O
. O
The O
chattering O
and O
whistling O
birds O
were O
still O
at O
it O
. O
Two NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
girls NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
Farival NOM_PER
twins NOM_PER
, O
were O
playing O
a O
duet O
from O
" O
Zampa O
" O
upon O
the O
piano O
. O
Madame PROP_PER
Lebrun PROP_PER
was O
bustling O
in O
and O
out O
, O
giving O
orders O
in O
a O
high O
key O
to O
a NOM_PER
yard-boy NOM_PER
whenever O
she PRON_PER
got O
inside O
the O
house O
, O
and O
directions O
in O
an O
equally O
high O
voice O
to O
a NOM_PER
dining-room NOM_PER
servant NOM_PER
whenever O
she PRON_PER
got O
outside O
. O
She PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
fresh NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
pretty NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
clad NOM_PER
always NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
white NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
elbow NOM_PER
sleeves NOM_PER
. O
Her PRON_PER
starched O
skirts O
crinkled O
as O
she PRON_PER
came O
and O
went O
. O
Farther O
down O
, O
before O
one O
of O
the O
cottages O
, O
a NOM_PER
lady NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
black NOM_PER
was O
walking O
demurely O
up O
and O
down O
, O
telling O
her PRON_PER
beads O
. O
A NOM_PER
good NOM_PER
many NOM_PER
persons NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
pension NOM_PER
had O
gone O
over O
to O
the O
Cheniere O
Caminada O
in O
Beaudelet O
's O
lugger O
to O
hear O
mass O
. O
Some NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
people NOM_PER
were O
out O
under O
the O
wateroaks O
playing O
croquet O
. O
Mr. PROP_PER
Pontellier PROP_PER
's O
two O
children O
were O
there O
-- O
sturdy O
little O
fellows O
of O
four O
and O
five O
. O
A O
quadroon O
nurse O
followed O
them O
about O
with O
a O
faraway O
, O
meditative O
air O
. O
Mr. O
Pontellier O
finally O
lit O
a O
cigar O
and O
began O
to O
smoke O
, O
letting O
the O
paper O
drag O
idly O
from O
his O
hand O
. O
He O
fixed O
his O
gaze O
upon O
a O
white O
sunshade O
that O
was O
advancing O
at O
snail O
's O
pace O
from O
the O
beach O
. O
He O
could O
see O
it O
plainly O
between O
the O
gaunt O
trunks O
of O
the O
water-oaks O
and O
across O
the O
stretch O
of O
yellow O
camomile O
. O
The O
gulf O
looked O
far O
away O
, O
melting O
hazily O
into O
the O
blue O
of O
the O
horizon O
. O
The O
sunshade O
continued O
to O
approach O
slowly O
. O
Beneath O
its O
pink-lined O
shelter O
were O
his O
wife O
, O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
, O
and O
young O
Robert O
Lebrun O
. O
When O
they O
reached O
the O
cottage O
, O
the O
two O
seated O
themselves O
with O
some O
appearance O
of O
fatigue O
upon O
the O
upper O
step O
of O
the O
porch O
, O
facing O
each O
other O
, O
each O
leaning O
against O
a O
supporting O
post O
. O
" O
What O
folly O
! O
to O
bathe O
at O
such O
an O
hour O
in O
such O
heat O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mr. O
Pontellier O
. O
He O
himself O
had O
taken O
a O
plunge O
at O
daylight O
. O
That O
was O
why O
the O
morning O
seemed O
long O
to O
him O
. O
" O
You O
are O
burnt O
beyond O
recognition O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
looking O
at O
his O
wife O
as O
one O
looks O
at O
a O
valuable O
piece O
of O
personal O
property O
which O
has O
suffered O
some O
damage O
. O
She O
held O
up O
her O
hands O
, O
strong O
, O
shapely O
hands O
, O
and O
surveyed O
them O
critically O
, O
drawing O
up O
her O
fawn O
sleeves O
above O
the O
wrists O
. O
Looking O
at O
them O
reminded O
her O
of O
her O
rings O
, O
which O
she O
had O
given O
to O
her O
husband O
before O
leaving O
for O
the O
beach O
. O
She O
silently O
reached O
out O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
, O
understanding O
, O
took O
the O
rings O
from O
his O
vest O
pocket O
and O
dropped O
them O
into O
her O
open O
palm O
. O
She O
slipped O
them O
upon O
her O
fingers O
; O
then O
clasping O
her O
knees O
, O
she O
looked O
across O
at O
Robert O
and O
began O
to O
laugh O
. O
The O
rings O
sparkled O
upon O
her O
fingers O
. O
He O
sent O
back O
an O
answering O
smile O
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
Pontellier O
, O
looking O
lazily O
and O
amused O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O
It O
was O
some O
utter O
nonsense O
; O
some O
adventure O
out O
there O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
they O
both O
tried O
to O
relate O
it O
at O
once O
. O
It O
did O
not O
seem O
half O
so O
amusing O
when O
told O
. O
They O
realized O
this O
, O
and O
so O
did O
Mr. O
Pontellier O
. O
He O
yawned O
and O
stretched O
himself O
. O
Then O
he O
got O
up O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
go O
over O
to O
Klein O
's O
hotel O
and O
play O
a O
game O
of O
billiards O
. O
" O
Come O
go O
along O
, O
Lebrun O
, O
" O
he O
proposed O
to O
Robert O
. O
But O
Robert O
admitted O
quite O
frankly O
that O
he O
preferred O
to O
stay O
where O
he O
was O
and O
talk O
to O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
send O
him O
about O
his O
business O
when O
he O
bores O
you O
, O
Edna O
, O
" O
instructed O
her O
husband O
as O
he O
prepared O
to O
leave O
. O
" O
Here O
, O
take O
the O
umbrella O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
holding O
it O
out O
to O
him O
. O
He O
accepted O
the O
sunshade O
, O
and O
lifting O
it O
over O
his O
head O
descended O
the O
steps O
and O
walked O
away O
. O
" O
Coming O
back O
to O
dinner O
? O
" O
his O
wife O
called O
after O
him O
. O
He O
halted O
a O
moment O
and O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
. O
He O
felt O
in O
his O
vest O
pocket O
; O
there O
was O
a O
ten-dollar O
bill O
there O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
; O
perhaps O
he O
would O
return O
for O
the O
early O
dinner O
and O
perhaps O
he O
would O
not O
. O
It O
all O
depended O
upon O
the O
company O
which O
he O
found O
over O
at O
Klein O
's O
and O
the O
size O
of O
" O
the O
game O
. O
" O
He O
did O
not O
say O
this O
, O
but O
she O
understood O
it O
, O
and O
laughed O
, O
nodding O
good-by O
to O
him O
. O
Both O
children O
wanted O
to O
follow O
their O
father O
when O
they O
saw O
him O
starting O
out O
. O
He O
kissed O
them O
and O
promised O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
bonbons O
and O
peanuts O
. O
II O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
's O
eyes O
were O
quick O
and O
bright O
; O
they O
were O
a O
yellowish O
brown O
, O
about O
the O
color O
of O
her O
hair O
. O
She O
had O
a O
way O
of O
turning O
them O
swiftly O
upon O
an O
object O
and O
holding O
them O
there O
as O
if O
lost O
in O
some O
inward O
maze O
of O
contemplation O
or O
thought O
. O
Her O
eyebrows O
were O
a O
shade O
darker O
than O
her O
hair O
. O
They O
were O
thick O
and O
almost O
horizontal O
, O
emphasizing O
the O
depth O
of O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
was O
rather O
handsome O
than O
beautiful O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
captivating O
by O
reason O
of O
a O
certain O
frankness O
of O
expression O
and O
a O
contradictory O
subtle O
play O
of O
features O
. O
Her O
manner O
was O
engaging O
. O
Robert O
rolled O
a O
cigarette O
. O
He O
smoked O
cigarettes O
because O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
cigars O
, O
he O
said O
. O
He O
had O
a O
cigar O
in O
his O
pocket O
which O
Mr. O
Pontellier O
had O
presented O
him O
with O
, O
and O
he O
was O
saving O
it O
for O
his O
after-dinner O
smoke O
. O
This O
seemed O
quite O
proper O
and O
natural O
on O
his O
part O
. O
In O
coloring O
he O
was O
not O
unlike O
his O
companion O
. O
A O
clean-shaved O
face O
made O
the O
resemblance O
more O
pronounced O
than O
it O
would O
otherwise O
have O
been O
. O
There O
rested O
no O
shadow O
of O
care O
upon O
his O
open O
countenance O
. O
His O
eyes O
gathered O
in O
and O
reflected O
the O
light O
and O
languor O
of O
the O
summer O
day O
. O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
reached O
over O
for O
a O
palm-leaf O
fan O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
porch O
and O
began O
to O
fan O
herself O
, O
while O
Robert O
sent O
between O
his O
lips O
light O
puffs O
from O
his O
cigarette O
. O
They O
chatted O
incessantly O
: O
about O
the O
things O
around O
them O
; O
their O
amusing O
adventure O
out O
in O
the O
water O
-- O
it O
had O
again O
assumed O
its O
entertaining O
aspect O
; O
about O
the O
wind O
, O
the O
trees O
, O
the O
people O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
Cheniere O
; O
about O
the O
children O
playing O
croquet O
under O
the O
oaks O
, O
and O
the O
Farival O
twins O
, O
who O
were O
now O
performing O
the O
overture O
to O
" O
The O
Poet O
and O
the O
Peasant O
. O
" O
Robert O
talked O
a O
good O
deal O
about O
himself O
. O
He O
was O
very O
young O
, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
any O
better O
. O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
talked O
a O
little O
about O
herself O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
. O
Each O
was O
interested O
in O
what O
the O
other O
said O
. O
Robert O
spoke O
of O
his O
intention O
to O
go O
to O
Mexico O
in O
the O
autumn O
, O
where O
fortune O
awaited O
him O
. O
He O
was O
always O
intending O
to O
go O
to O
Mexico O
, O
but O
some O
way O
never O
got O
there O
. O
Meanwhile O
he O
held O
on O
to O
his O
modest O
position O
in O
a O
mercantile O
house O
in O
New O
Orleans O
, O
where O
an O
equal O
familiarity O
with O
English O
, O
French O
and O
Spanish O
gave O
him O
no O
small O
value O
as O
a O
clerk O
and O
correspondent O
. O
He O
was O
spending O
his O
summer O
vacation O
, O
as O
he O
always O
did O
, O
with O
his O
mother O
at O
Grand O
Isle O
. O
In O
former O
times O
, O
before O
Robert O
could O
remember O
, O
" O
the O
house O
" O
had O
been O
a O
summer O
luxury O
of O
the O
Lebruns O
. O
Now O
, O
flanked O
by O
its O
dozen O
or O
more O
cottages O
, O
which O
were O
always O
filled O
with O
exclusive O
visitors O
from O
the O
" O
Quartier O
Francais O
, O
" O
it O
enabled O
Madame O
Lebrun O
to O
maintain O
the O
easy O
and O
comfortable O
existence O
which O
appeared O
to O
be O
her O
birthright O
. O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
talked O
about O
her O
father O
's O
Mississippi O
plantation O
and O
her O
girlhood O
home O
in O
the O
old O
Kentucky O
bluegrass O
country O
. O
She O
was O
an O
American O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
small O
infusion O
of O
French O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
lost O
in O
dilution O
. O
She O
read O
a O
letter O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
who O
was O
away O
in O
the O
East O
, O
and O
who O
had O
engaged O
herself O
to O
be O
married O
. O
Robert O
was O
interested O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
manner O
of O
girls O
the O
sisters O
were O
, O
what O
the O
father O
was O
like O
, O
and O
how O
long O
the O
mother O
had O
been O
dead O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
folded O
the O
letter O
it O
was O
time O
for O
her O
to O
dress O
for O
the O
early O
dinner O
. O
" O
I O
see O
Leonce O
is O
n't O
coming O
back O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
in O
the O
direction O
whence O
her O
husband O
had O
disappeared O
. O
Robert O
supposed O
he O
was O
not O
, O
as O
there O
were O
a O
good O
many O
New O
Orleans O
club O
men O
over O
at O
Klein O
's O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Pontellier O
left O
him O
to O
enter O
her O
room O
, O
the O
young O
man O
descended O
the O
steps O
and O
strolled O
over O
toward O
the O
croquet O
players O
, O
where O
, O
during O
the O
half-hour O
before O
dinner O
, O
he O
amused O
himself O
with O
the O
little O
Pontellier O
children O
, O
who O
were O
very O
fond O
of O

Mary PROP_PER

was O
the NOM_PER

Eliza NOM_PER
, O
a O
gentle O
, O
fashionable O
girl O
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
indolence O
in O
her O
temper O
, O
which O
might O
be O
termed O
negative O
good-nature O
: O
her O
virtues O
, O
indeed O
, O
were O
all O
of O
that O
stamp O
. O
She O
carefully O
attended O
to O
the O
_ O
shews O
_ O
of O
things O
, O
and O
her O
opinions O
, O
I O
should O
have O
said O
prejudices O
, O
were O
such O
as O
the O
generality O
approved O
of O
. O
She O
was O
educated O
with O
the O
expectation O
of O
a O
large O
fortune O
, O
of O
course O
became O
a O
mere O
machine O
: O
the O
homage O
of O
her O
attendants O
made O
a O
great O
part O
of O
her O
puerile O
amusements O
, O
and O
she O
never O
imagined O
there O
were O
any O
relative O
duties O
for O
her O
to O
fulfil O
: O
notions O
of O
her O
own O
consequence O
, O
by O
these O
means O
, O
were O
interwoven O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
the O
years O
of O
youth O
spent O
in O
acquiring O
a O
few O
superficial O
accomplishments O
, O
without O
having O
any O
taste O
for O
them O
. O
When O
she O
was O
first O
introduced O
into O
the O
polite O
circle O
, O
she O
danced O
with O
an O
officer O
, O
whom O
she O
faintly O
wished O
to O
be O
united O
to O
; O
but O
her O
father O
soon O
after O
recommending O
another O
in O
a O
more O
distinguished O
rank O
of O
life O
, O
she O
readily O
submitted O
to O
his O
will O
, O
and O
promised O
to O
love O
, O
honour O
, O
and O
obey O
, O
( O
a O
vicious O
fool O
, O
) O
as O
in O
duty O
bound O
. O
While O
they O
resided O
in O
London O
, O
they O
lived O
in O
the O
usual O
fashionable O
style O
, O
and O
seldom O
saw O
each O
other O
; O
nor O
were O
they O
much O
more O
sociable O
when O
they O
wooed O
rural O
felicity O
for O
more O
than O
half O
the O
year O
, O
in O
a O
delightful O
country O
, O
where O
Nature O
, O
with O
lavish O
hand O
, O
had O
scattered O
beauties O
around O
; O
for O
the O
master O
, O
with O
brute O
, O
unconscious O
gaze O
, O
passed O
them O
by O
unobserved O
, O
and O
sought O
amusement O
in O
country O
sports O
. O
He O
hunted O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
after O
eating O
an O
immoderate O
dinner O
, O
generally O
fell O
asleep O
: O
this O
seasonable O
rest O
enabled O
him O
to O
digest O
the O
cumbrous O
load O
; O
he O
would O
then O
visit O
some O
of O
his O
pretty O
tenants O
; O
and O
when O
he O
compared O
their O
ruddy O
glow O
of O
health O
with O
his O
wife O
's O
countenance O
, O
which O
even O
rouge O
could O
not O
enliven O
, O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
say O
which O
a O
_ O
gourmand O
_ O
would O
give O
the O
preference O
to O
. O
Their O
vulgar O
dance O
of O
spirits O
were O
infinitely O
more O
agreeable O
to O
his O
fancy O
than O
her O
sickly O
, O
die-away O
languor O
. O
Her O
voice O
was O
but O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O
sound O
, O
and O
she O
had O
, O
to O
complete O
her O
delicacy O
, O
so O
relaxed O
her O
nerves O
, O
that O
she O
became O
a O
mere O
nothing O
. O
Many O
such O
noughts O
are O
there O
in O
the O
female O
world O
! O
yet O
she O
had O
a O
good O
opinion O
of O
her O
own O
merit O
, O
-- O
truly O
, O
she O
said O
long O
prayers O
, O
-- O
and O
sometimes O
read O
her O
Week O
's O
Preparation O
: O
she O
dreaded O
that O
horrid O
place O
vulgarly O
called O
_ O
hell O
_ O
, O
the O
regions O
below O
; O
but O
whether O
her O
's O
was O
a O
mounting O
spirit O
, O
I O
can O
not O
pretend O
to O
determine O
; O
or O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
planet O
would O
have O
been O
proper O
for O
her O
, O
when O
she O
left O
her O
_ O

part O
in O
this O
world O
, O
let O
metaphysicians O
settle O
; O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
to O
her O
unclothed O
spirit O

As O
she O
was O
sometimes O
obliged O
to O
be O
alone O
, O
or O
only O
with O
her O
French O
waiting-maid O
, O
she O
sent O
to O
the O

all O

while O
she O
was O
dressing O
her O
hair O
, O
and O
she O
could O
turn O
her O
eyes O
from O
the O
glass O
, O
she O
ran O
over O
those O
most O
delightful O
substitutes O
for O

I O

bodily O

the O

and O
the O
compliments O
offered O
up O
at O
the O
shrine O
of O
false O
beauty O
, O
are O
all O
equally O
addressed O
to O

When O
she O
could O
not O
any O
longer O
indulge O
the O
caprices O
of O

tried O
another O

The O
Platonic O
Marriage O
, O
Eliza O
Warwick O

and O
some O
other O
interesting O
tales O
were O
perused O
with O
eagerness O

Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
natural O
than O
the O
developement O
of O
the O
passions O
, O
nor O
more O
striking O
than O
the O
views O
of O
the O
human O
heart O

which O
caught O
the O
swain O
by O
the O
upper-garment O
, O
and O
presented O
to O
his O
ravished O
eyes O
a O
portrait O
. O
-- O
Fatal O
image O
! O
-- O
It O
planted O
a O
thorn O
in O
a O
till O
then O
insensible O
heart O
, O
and O
sent O
a O
new O
kind O
of O
a O
knight-errant O
into O
the O
world O
. O
But O
even O
this O
was O
nothing O
to O
the O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
the O
circumstance O
on O
which O
it O
hung O

the O
hornet O
settling O
on O

face O

What O
a O

heart-rending O

accident O
! O
She O
planted O
, O
in O
imitation O
of O
those O
susceptible O
souls O
, O
a O
rose O
bush O
; O
but O
there O
was O
not O
a O
lover O
to O
weep O
in O
concert O
with O
her O
, O
when O
she O
watered O
it O
with O
her O
tears O

Alas O

Alas O
! O
If O
my O
readers O
would O
excuse O
the O
sportiveness O
of O
fancy O
, O
and O
give O
me O
credit O
for O
genius O
, O
I O
would O
go O
on O
and O
tell O
them O
such O
tales O
as O
would O
force O
the O
sweet O
tears O
of O
sensibility O
to O
flow O
in O
copious O
showers O
down O
beautiful O
cheeks O
, O
to O
the O
discomposure O

c. O
Nay O
, O
I O
would O
make O
it O
so O
interesting O
, O
that O
the O
fair O
peruser O
should O
beg O
the O
hair-dresser O
to O
settle O
the O
curls O
himself O
, O
and O
not O
interrupt O
her O
. O
She O
had O
besides O
another O
resource O
, O
two O
most O
beautiful O
dogs O
, O
who O
shared O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
reclined O
on O
cushions O
near O
her O
all O
the O
day O
. O
These O
she O
watched O
with O
the O
most O
assiduous O
care O
, O
and O
bestowed O
on O
them O
the O
warmest O
caresses O
. O
This O
fondness O
for O
animals O
was O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
_ O
attendrissement O
_ O
which O
makes O
a O
person O
take O
pleasure O
in O
providing O
for O
the O
subsistence O
and O
comfort O
of O
a O
living O
creature O
; O
but O
it O
proceeded O
from O
vanity O
, O
it O
gave O
her O
an O
opportunity O
of O
lisping O
out O
the O
prettiest O
French O
expressions O
of O
ecstatic O
fondness O
, O
in O
accents O
that O
had O
never O
been O
attuned O
by O
tenderness O
. O
She O
was O
chaste O
, O
according O
to O
the O
vulgar O
acceptation O
of O
the O
word O
, O
that O
is O
, O
she O
did O
not O
make O
any O
actual O
_ O
faux O
pas O
_ O
; O
she O
feared O
the O
world O
, O
and O
was O
indolent O
; O
but O
then O
, O
to O
make O
amends O
for O
this O
seeming O
self-denial O
, O
she O
read O
all O
the O
sentimental O
novels O
, O
dwelt O
on O
the O
love-scenes O
, O
and O
, O
had O
she O
thought O
while O
she O
read O
, O
her O
mind O
would O
have O
been O
contaminated O
; O
as O
she O
accompanied O
the O
lovers O
to O
the O
lonely O
arbors O
, O
and O
would O
walk O
with O
them O
by O
the O
clear O
light O
of O
the O
moon O
. O
She O
wondered O
her O
husband O
did O
not O
stay O
at O
home O
. O
She O
was O
jealous O
-- O
why O
did O
he O
not O
love O
her O
, O
sit O
by O
her O
side O
, O
squeeze O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
look O
unutterable O
things O

Gentle O
reader O

I O
will O
tell O
thee O
; O
they O
neither O
of O
them O
felt O
what O
they O
could O
not O
utter O

I O
will O
not O
pretend O
to O
say O
that O
they O
always O
annexed O
an O
idea O
to O
a O
word O
; O
but O
they O
had O
none O
of O
those O
feelings O
which O
are O
not O
easily O

II O

In O
due O
time O
she O
brought O
forth O
a O
son O
, O
a O
feeble O
babe O
; O
and O
the O
following O
year O
a O
daughter O
. O
After O
the O
mother O
's O
throes O
she O
felt O
very O
few O
sentiments O
of O
maternal O
tenderness O
: O
the O
children O
were O
given O
to O
nurses O
, O
and O
she O
played O
with O
her O
dogs O
. O
Want O
of O
exercise O
prevented O
the O
least O
chance O
of O
her O
recovering O
strength O
; O
and O
two O
or O
three O
milk-fevers O
brought O
on O
a O
consumption O
, O
to O
which O
her O
constitution O
tended O
. O
Her O
children O
all O
died O
in O
their O
infancy O
, O
except O
the O
two O
first O
, O
and O
she O
began O
to O
grow O
fond O
of O
the O
son O
, O
as O
he O
was O
remarkably O
handsome O
. O
For O
years O
she O
divided O
her O
time O
between O
the O
sofa O
, O
and O
the O
card-table O
. O
She O
thought O
not O
of O
death O
, O
though O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
the O
grave O
; O
nor O
did O
any O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
her O
station O
occur O
to O
her O
as O
necessary O
. O
Her O
children O
were O
left O
in O
the O
nursery O
; O
and O
when O
Mary O
, O
the O
little O
blushing O
girl O
, O
appeared O
, O
she O
would O
send O
the O
awkward O
thing O
away O
. O
To O
own O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
was O
awkward O
enough O
, O
in O
a O
house O
without O
any O
play-mates O
; O
for O
her O
brother O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
school O
, O
and O
she O
scarcely O
knew O
how O
to O
employ O
herself O
; O
she O
would O
ramble O
about O
the O
garden O
, O
admire O
the O
flowers O
, O
and O
play O
with O
the O
dogs O
. O
An O
old O
house-keeper O
told O
her O
stories O
, O
read O
to O
her O
, O
and O
, O
at O
last O
, O
taught O
her O
to O
read O
. O
Her O
mother O
talked O
of O
enquiring O
for O
a O
governess O
when O
her O
health O
would O
permit O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
interim O
desired O
her O
own O
maid O
to O
teach O
her O
French O
. O
As O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
read O
, O
she O
perused O
with O
avidity O
every O
book O
that O
came O
in O
her O
way O
. O
Neglected O
in O
every O
respect O
, O
and O
left O
to O
the O
operations O
of O
her O
own O
mind O
, O
she O
considered O
every O
thing O
that O
came O
under O
her O
inspection O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
think O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
of O
a O
separate O
state O
, O
and O
that O
angels O
sometimes O
visited O
this O
earth O
. O
She O
would O
sit O
in O
a O
thick O
wood O
in O
the O
park O
, O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
; O
make O
little O
songs O
addressed O
to O
them O
, O
and O
sing O
them O
to O
tunes O
of O
her O
own O
composing O
; O
and O
her O
native O
wood O
notes O
wild O
were O
sweet O
and O
touching O
. O
Her O
father O
always O
exclaimed O
against O
female O
acquirements O
, O
and O
was O
glad O
that O
his O
wife O
's O
indolence O
and O
ill O
health O
made O
her O
not O
trouble O
herself O
about O
them O
. O
She O
had O
besides O
another O
reason O
, O
she O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
have O
a O
fine O
tall O
girl O
brought O
forward O
into O
notice O
as O
her O
daughter O
; O
she O
still O
expected O
to O
recover O
, O
and O
figure O
away O
in O
the O
gay O
world O
. O
Her O
husband O
was O
very O
tyrannical O
and O
passionate O
; O
indeed O
so O
very O
easily O
irritated O
when O
inebriated O
, O
that O
Mary O
was O
continually O
in O
dread O
lest O
he O
should O
frighten O
her O
mother O
to O
death O
; O
her O
sickness O
called O
forth O
all O
Mary O
's O
tenderness O
, O
and O
exercised O
her O
compassion O
so O
continually O
, O
that O
it O
became O
more O
than O
a O
match O
for O
self-love O
, O
and O
was O
the O
governing O
propensity O
of O
her O
heart O
through O
life O
. O
She O
was O
violent O
in O
her O
temper O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
her O
father O
's O
faults O
, O
and O
would O
weep O
when O
obliged O
to O
compare O
his O
temper O
with O
her O
own O
. O
-- O
She O
did O
more O
; O
artless O
prayers O
rose O
to O
Heaven O
for O
pardon O
, O
when O
she O
was O
conscious O
of O
having O
erred O
; O
and O
her O
contrition O
was O
so O
exceedingly O
painful O
, O
that O
she O
watched O
diligently O
the O
first O
movements O
of O
anger O
and O
impatience O
, O
to O
save O
herself O
this O
cruel O
remorse O
. O
Sublime O
ideas O
filled O
her O
young O
mind O
-- O
always O
connected O
with O
devotional O
sentiments O
; O
extemporary O
effusions O
of O
gratitude O
, O
and O
rhapsodies O
of O
praise O
would O
burst O
often O
from O
her O
, O
when O
she O
listened O
to O
the O
birds O
, O
or O
pursued O
the O
deer O

She O
would O
gaze O
on O
the O

ramble O
through O

The O
wandering O

which O
she O
imagined O
inhabited O
every O
part O
of O
nature O
, O
were O
her O
constant O

She O
began O
to O
consider O
the O

formed O
just O

his O

, O

she O

not O

soon O

, O
have O
sought O
out O

Her O
sensibility O
prompted O
her O

search O
for O
an O
object O

on O

it O
was O
not O

her O
mother O
had O
often O
disappointed O
her O
, O
and O
the O
apparent O
partiality O
she O
shewed O
to O
her O
brother O
gave O
her O
exquisite O
pain O
-- O
produced O
a O
kind O
of O
habitual O
melancholy O
, O
led O
her O
into O
a O
fondness O
for O
reading O

I PRON_PER
have O
seldom O
heard O
him PRON_PER
mention O
her PRON_PER
under O
any O
other O

. O
In O
his PRON_PER
eyes O
she PRON_PER
eclipses O
and O
predominates O
the O
whole O
of O
her PRON_PER
sex O
. O
It O
was O
not O
that O
he PRON_PER
felt O
any O
emotion O
akin O
to O

for O
Irene PROP_PER
Adler PROP_PER
. O
All O
emotions O
, O
and O
that O
one O
particularly O
, O
were O
abhorrent O
to O
his PRON_PER
cold O
, O
precise O
but O
admirably O
balanced O
mind O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
, O
I PRON_PER
take O
it O
, O
the NOM_PER
most NOM_PER
perfect NOM_PER
reasoning NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
observing NOM_PER
machine NOM_PER
that NOM_PER
the NOM_PER

but O
as O
a NOM_PER

he PRON_PER
would O
have O
placed O
himself PRON_PER
in O
a O
false O

. O
He PRON_PER
never O
spoke O
of O
the O
softer O
passions O
, O
save O
with O
a O
gibe O
and O
a O
sneer O
. O
They O
were O
admirable O

the NOM_PER

-- O
excellent O
for O

But O
for O

reasoner NOM_PER
to O
admit O
such O
intrusions O
into O
his PRON_PER
own O
delicate O
and O
finely O
adjusted O
temperament O
was O
to O
introduce O
a O
distracting O
factor O
which O
might O
throw O
a O
doubt O
upon O
all O
his PRON_PER
mental O
results O
. O
Grit O
in O
a O
sensitive O
instrument O
, O
or O
a O
crack O
in O
one O
of O
his PRON_PER
own O
high-power O

, O
would O
not O
be O
more O
disturbing O
than O
a O
strong O
emotion O
in O
a O
nature O
such O
as O
his PRON_PER
. O
And O
yet O
there O
was O
but O
one NOM_PER

to O
him PRON_PER

that O

was O
the PROP_PER

of O

I PRON_PER
had O
seen O
little O
of O
Holmes PROP_PER
lately O

My PRON_PER

had O
drifted O
us PRON_PER
away O

My PRON_PER

, O
were O
sufficient O
to O
absorb O
all O
my O
attention O
, O
while O
Holmes O
, O
who O
loathed O
every O
form O
of O
society O
with O
his O
whole O
Bohemian O
soul O
, O
remained O
in O
our O
lodgings O
in O
Baker O
Street O
, O
buried O
among O
his O
old O
books O
, O
and O
alternating O
from O
week O
to O
week O
between O
cocaine O
and O
ambition O
, O
the O
drowsiness O
of O
the O
drug O
, O
and O
the O
fierce O
energy O
of O
his O
own O
keen O
nature O
. O
He O
was O
still O
, O
as O
ever O
, O
deeply O
attracted O
by O
the O
study O
of O
crime O
, O
and O
occupied O
his O
immense O
faculties O
and O
extraordinary O
powers O
of O
observation O
in O
following O
out O
those O
clues O
, O
and O
clearing O
up O
those O
mysteries O
which O
had O
been O
abandoned O
as O
hopeless O
by O
the O
official O
police O
. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
I O
heard O
some O
vague O
account O
of O
his O
doings O
: O
of O
his O
summons O
to O
Odessa O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Trepoff O
murder O
, O
of O
his O
clearing O
up O
of O
the O
singular O
tragedy O
of O
the O
Atkinson O
brothers O
at O
Trincomalee O
, O
and O
finally O
of O
the O
mission O
which O
he O
had O
accomplished O
so O
delicately O
and O
successfully O
for O
the O
reigning O
family O
of O
Holland O
. O
Beyond O
these O
signs O
of O
his O
activity O
, O
however O
, O
which O
I O
merely O
shared O
with O
all O
the O
readers O
of O
the O
daily O
press O
, O
I O
knew O
little O
of O
my O
former O
friend O
and O
companion O
. O
One O
night O
-- O
it O
was O
on O
the O
twentieth O
of O
March O
, O
1888 O
-- O
I O
was O
returning O
from O
a O
journey O
to O
a O
patient O
( O
for O
I O
had O
now O
returned O
to O
civil O
practice O
) O
, O
when O
my O
way O
led O
me O
through O
Baker O
Street O
. O
As O
I O
passed O
the O
well-remembered O
door O
, O
which O
must O
always O
be O
associated O
in O
my O
mind O
with O
my O
wooing O
, O
and O
with O
the O
dark O
incidents O
of O
the O
Study O
in O
Scarlet O
, O
I O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
keen O
desire O
to O
see O
Holmes O
again O
, O
and O
to O
know O
how O
he O
was O
employing O
his O
extraordinary O
powers O
. O
His O
rooms O
were O
brilliantly O
lit O
, O
and O
, O
even O
as O
I O
looked O
up O
, O
I O
saw O
his O
tall O
, O
spare O
figure O
pass O
twice O
in O
a O
dark O
silhouette O
against O
the O
blind O
. O
He O
was O
pacing O
the O
room O
swiftly O
, O
eagerly O
, O
with O
his O
head O
sunk O
upon O
his O
chest O
and O
his O
hands O
clasped O
behind O
him O
. O
To O
me O
, O
who O
knew O
his O
every O
mood O
and O
habit O
, O
his O
attitude O
and O
manner O
told O
their O
own O
story O
. O
He O
was O
at O
work O
again O
. O
He O
had O
risen O
out O
of O
his O
drug-created O
dreams O
and O
was O
hot O
upon O
the O
scent O
of O
some O
new O
problem O
. O
I O
rang O
the O
bell O
and O
was O
shown O
up O
to O
the O
chamber O
which O
had O
formerly O
been O
in O
part O
my O
own O
. O
His O
manner O
was O
not O
effusive O
. O
It O
seldom O
was O
; O
but O
he O
was O
glad O
, O
I O
think O
, O
to O
see O
me O
. O
With O
hardly O
a O
word O
spoken O
, O
but O
with O
a O
kindly O
eye O
, O
he O
waved O
me O
to O
an O
armchair O
, O
threw O
across O
his O
case O
of O
cigars O
, O
and O
indicated O
a O
spirit O
case O
and O
a O
gasogene O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
Then O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
fire O
and O
looked O
me O
over O
in O
his O
singular O
introspective O
fashion O
. O
" O
Wedlock O
suits O
you O
, O
" O
he O
remarked O
. O
" O
I O
think O
, O
Watson O
, O
that O
you O
have O
put O
on O
seven O
and O
a O
half O
pounds O
since O
I O
saw O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Seven O
! O
" O
I O
answered O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
a O
little O
more O
. O
Just O
a O
trifle O
more O
, O
I O
fancy O
, O
Watson O
. O
And O
in O
practice O
again O
, O
I O
observe O
. O
You O
did O
not O
tell O
me O
that O
you O
intended O
to O
go O
into O
harness O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
, O
how O
do O
you O
know O
? O
" O
" O
I O
see O
it O
, O
I O
deduce O
it O
. O
How O
do O
I O
know O
that O
you O
have O
been O
getting O
yourself O
very O
wet O
lately O
, O
and O
that O
you O
have O
a O
most O
clumsy O
and O
careless O
servant O
girl O
? O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Holmes O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
this O
is O
too O
much O
. O
You O
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
burned O
, O
had O
you O
lived O
a O
few O
centuries O
ago O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
had O
a O
country O
walk O
on O
Thursday O
and O
came O
home O
in O
a O
dreadful O
mess O
, O
but O
as O
I O
have O
changed O
my O
clothes O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
you O
deduce O
it O
. O
As O
to O
Mary O
Jane O
, O
she O
is O
incorrigible O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
has O
given O
her O
notice O
, O
but O
there O
, O
again O
, O
I O
fail O
to O
see O
how O
you O
work O
it O
out O
. O
" O
He O
chuckled O
to O
himself O
and O
rubbed O
his O
long O
, O
nervous O
hands O
together O
. O
" O
It O
is O
simplicity O
itself O
, O
" O
said O
he O
; O
" O
my O
eyes O
tell O
me O
that O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
your O
left O
shoe O
, O
just O
where O
the O
firelight O
strikes O
it O
, O
the O
leather O
is O
scored O
by O
six O
almost O
parallel O
cuts O
. O
Obviously O
they O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
someone O
who O
has O
very O
carelessly O
scraped O
round O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
sole O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
crusted O
mud O
from O
it O
. O
Hence O
, O
you O
see O
, O
my O
double O
deduction O
that O
you O
had O
been O
out O
in O
vile O
weather O
, O
and O
that O
you O
had O
a O
particularly O
malignant O
boot-slitting O
specimen O
of O
the O
London O
slavey O
. O
As O
to O
your O
practice O
, O
if O
a O
gentleman O
walks O
into O
my O
rooms O
smelling O
of O
iodoform O
, O
with O
a O
black O
mark O
of O
nitrate O
of O
silver O
upon O
his O
right O
forefinger O
, O
and O
a O
bulge O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
his O
top-hat O
to O
show O
where O
he O
has O
secreted O
his O
stethoscope O
, O
I O
must O
be O
dull O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
I O
do O
not O
pronounce O
him O
to O
be O
an O
active O
member O
of O
the O
medical O
profession O
. O
" O
I O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
he O
explained O
his O
process O
of O
deduction O
. O
" O
When O
I O
hear O
you O
give O
your O
reasons O
, O
" O
I O
remarked O
, O
" O
the O
thing O
always O
appears O
to O
me O
to O
be O
so O
ridiculously O
simple O
that O
I O
could O
easily O
do O
it O
myself O
, O
though O
at O
each O
successive O
instance O
of O
your O
reasoning O
I O
am O
baffled O
until O
you O
explain O
your O
process O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
believe O
that O
my O
eyes O
are O
as O
good O
as O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
Quite O
so O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
lighting O
a O
cigarette O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
down O
into O
an O
armchair O
. O
" O
You O
see O
, O
but O
you O
do O
not O
observe O
. O
The O
distinction O
is O
clear O
. O
For O
example O
, O
you O
have O
frequently O
seen O
the O
steps O
which O
lead O
up O
from O
the O
hall O
to O
this O
room O
. O
" O
" O
Frequently O
. O
" O
" O
How O
often O
? O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
some O
hundreds O
of O
times O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
how O
many O
are O
there O
? O
" O
" O
How O
many O
? O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
" O
" O
Quite O
so O
! O
You O
have O
not O
observed O
. O
And O
yet O
you O
have O
seen O
. O
That O
is O
just O
my O
point O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
know O
that O
there O
are O
seventeen O
steps O
, O
because O
I O
have O
both O
seen O
and O
observed O
. O
By-the-way O
, O
since O
you O
are O
interested O
in O
these O
little O
problems O
, O
and O
since O
you O
are O
good O
enough O
to O
chronicle O
one O
or O
two O
of O
my O
trifling O
experiences O
, O
you O
may O
be O
interested O
in O
this O
. O
" O
He O
threw O
over O
a O
sheet O
of O
thick O
, O
pink-tinted O
note-paper O
which O
had O
been O
lying O
open O
upon O
the O
table O
. O
" O
It O
came O
by O
the O
last O
post O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
Read O
it O
aloud O
. O
" O
The O
note O
was O
undated O
, O
and O
without O
either O
signature O
or O
address O
. O
" O
There O
will O
call O
upon O
you O
to-night O
, O
at O
a O
quarter O
to O
eight O
o'clock O
, O
" O
it O
said O
, O
" O
a O
gentleman O
who O
desires O
to O
consult O
you O
upon O
a O
matter O
of O
the O
very O
deepest O
moment O
. O
Your O
recent O
services O
to O
one O
of O
the O
royal O
houses O
of O
Europe O
have O
shown O
that O
you O
are O
one O
who O
may O
safely O
be O
trusted O
with O
matters O
which O
are O
of O
an O
importance O
which O
can O
hardly O
be O
exaggerated O
. O
This O
account O
of O
you O
we O
have O
from O
all O
quarters O
received O
. O
Be O
in O
your O
chamber O
then O
at O
that O
hour O
, O
and O
do O
not O
take O
it O
amiss O
if O
your O
visitor O
wear O
a O
mask O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
indeed O
a O
mystery O
, O
" O
I O
remarked O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
imagine O
that O
it O
means O
? O
" O
" O
I O
have O
no O
data O
yet O
. O
It O
is O
a O
capital O
mistake O
to O
theorize O
before O
one O
has O
data O
. O
Insensibly O
one O
begins O
to O
twist O
facts O
to O
suit O
theories O
, O
instead O
of O
theories O
to O
suit O
facts O
. O
But O
the O
note O
itself O
. O
What O
do O
you O
deduce O
from O
it O
? O
" O
I O
carefully O
examined O
the O
writing O
, O
and O
the O
paper O
upon O
which O
it O
was O
written O
. O
" O
The O
man O
who O
wrote O
it O
was O
presumably O
well O
to O
do O
, O
" O
I O
remarked O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
imitate O
my O
companion O
's O
processes O
. O
" O
Such O
paper O
could O
not O
be O
bought O
under O
half O
a O
crown O
a O
packet O
. O
It O
is O
peculiarly O
strong O
and O
stiff O
. O
" O
" O
Peculiar O
-- O
that O
is O
the O
very O
word O
, O
" O
said O
Holmes O
. O
" O
It O
is O
not O
an O
English O
paper O

all O

Hold O
it O
up O
to O

" O

THE NOM_PER
TWO NOM_PER
POETS NOM_PER
OF O
SAFFRON O
PARK O
THE O
suburb O
of O
Saffron O
Park O
lay O
on O
the O
sunset O
side O
of O
London O
, O
as O
red O
and O
ragged O
as O
a O
cloud O
of O
sunset O
. O
It O
was O
built O
of O
a O
bright O
brick O
throughout O
; O
its O
sky-line O
was O
fantastic O
, O
and O
even O
its O
ground O
plan O
was O
wild O
. O
It O
had O
been O
the O
outburst O
of O
a NOM_PER
speculative NOM_PER
builder NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
faintly NOM_PER
tinged NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
art NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
called NOM_PER
its NOM_PER
architecture NOM_PER
sometimes NOM_PER
Elizabethan NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
sometimes NOM_PER
Queen NOM_PER
Anne NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
apparently NOM_PER
under NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
impression NOM_PER
that NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
two NOM_PER
sovereigns NOM_PER
were NOM_PER
identical NOM_PER
. O
It O
was O
described O
with O
some O
justice O
as O
an O
artistic O
colony O
, O
though O
it O
never O
in O
any O
definable O
way O
produced O
any O
art O
. O
But O
although O
its O
pretensions O
to O
be O
an O
intellectual O
centre O
were O
a O
little O
vague O
, O
its O
pretensions O
to O
be O
a O
pleasant O
place O
were O
quite O
indisputable O
. O
The O
stranger O
who O
looked O
for O
the O
first O
time O
at O
the O
quaint O
red O
houses O
could O
only O
think O
how O
very O
oddly O
shaped O
the O
people O
must O
be O
who O
could O
fit O
in O
to O
them O
. O
Nor O
when O
he O
met O
the O
people O
was O
he O
disappointed O
in O
this O
respect O
. O
The O
place O
was O
not O
only O
pleasant O
, O
but O
perfect O
, O
if O
once O
he O
could O
regard O
it O
not O
as O
a O
deception O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
dream O
. O
Even O
if O
the O
people O
were O
not O
" O
artists O
, O
" O
the O
whole O
was O
nevertheless O
artistic O
. O
That O
young O
man O
with O
the O
long O
, O
auburn O
hair O
and O
the O
impudent O
face O
-- O
that O
young O
man O
was O
not O
really O
a O
poet O
; O
but O
surely O
he O
was O
a O
poem O
. O
That O
old O
gentleman O
with O
the O
wild O
, O
white O
beard O
and O
the O
wild O
, O
white O
hat O
-- O
that O
venerable O
humbug O
was O
not O
really O
a O
philosopher O
; O
but O
at O
least O
he O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
philosophy O
in O
others O
. O
That O
scientific O
gentleman O
with O
the O
bald O
, O
egg-like O
head O
and O
the O
bare O
, O
bird-like O
neck O
had O
no O
real O
right O
to O
the O
airs O
of O
science O
that O
he O
assumed O
. O
He O
had O
not O
discovered O
anything O
new O
in O
biology O
; O
but O
what O
biological O
creature O
could O
he O
have O
discovered O
more O
singular O
than O
himself O
? O
Thus O
, O
and O
thus O
only O
, O
the O
whole O
place O
had O
properly O
to O
be O
regarded O
; O
it O
had O
to O
be O
considered O
not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
workshop O
for O
artists O
, O
but O
as O
a O
frail O
but O
finished O
work O
of O
art O
. O
A O
man O
who O
stepped O
into O
its O
social O
atmosphere O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
had O
stepped O
into O
a O
written O
comedy O
. O
More O
especially O
this O
attractive O
unreality O
fell O
upon O
it O
about O
nightfall O
, O
when O
the O
extravagant O
roofs O
were O
dark O
against O
the O
afterglow O
and O
the O
whole O
insane O
village O
seemed O
as O
separate O
as O
a O
drifting O
cloud O
. O
This O
again O
was O
more O
strongly O
true O
of O
the O
many O
nights O
of O
local O
festivity O
, O
when O
the O
little O
gardens O
were O
often O
illuminated O
, O
and O
the O
big O
Chinese O
lanterns O
glowed O
in O
the O
dwarfish O
trees O
like O
some O
fierce O
and O
monstrous O
fruit O
. O
And O
this O
was O
strongest O
of O
all O
on O
one O
particular O
evening O
, O
still O
vaguely O
remembered O
in O
the O
locality O
, O
of O
which O
the O
auburn-haired O
poet O
was O
the O
hero O
. O
It O
was O
not O
by O
any O
means O
the O
only O
evening O
of O
which O
he O
was O
the O
hero O
. O
On O
many O
nights O
those O
passing O
by O
his O
little O
back O
garden O
might O
hear O
his O
high O
, O
didactic O
voice O
laying O
down O
the O
law O
to O
men O
and O
particularly O
to O
women O
. O
The O
attitude O
of O
women O
in O
such O
cases O
was O
indeed O
one O
of O
the O
paradoxes O
of O
the O
place O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
women O
were O
of O
the O
kind O
vaguely O
called O
emancipated O
, O
and O
professed O
some O
protest O
against O
male O
supremacy O
. O
Yet O
these O
new O
women O
would O
always O
pay O
to O
a O
man O
the O
extravagant O
compliment O
which O
no O
ordinary O
woman O
ever O
pays O
to O
him O
, O
that O
of O
listening O
while O
he O
is O
talking O
. O
And O
Mr. O
Lucian O
Gregory O
, O
the O
red-haired O
poet O
, O
was O
really O
( O
in O
some O
sense O
) O
a O
man O
worth O
listening O
to O
, O
even O
if O
one O
only O
laughed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
He O
put O
the O
old O
cant O
of O
the O
lawlessness O
of O
art O
and O
the O
art O
of O
lawlessness O
with O
a O
certain O
impudent O
freshness O
which O
gave O
at O
least O
a O
momentary O
pleasure O
. O
He O
was O
helped O
in O
some O
degree O
by O
the O
arresting O
oddity O
of O
his O
appearance O
, O
which O
he O
worked O
, O
as O
the O
phrase O
goes O
, O
for O
all O
it O
was O
worth O
. O
His O
dark O
red O
hair O
parted O
in O
the O
middle O
was O
literally O
like O
a O
woman O
’s O
, O
and O
curved O
into O
the O
slow O
curls O
of O
a O
virgin O
in O
a O
pre-Raphaelite O
picture O
. O
From O
within O
this O
almost O
saintly O
oval O
, O
however O
, O
his O
face O
projected O
suddenly O
broad O
and O
brutal O
, O
the O
chin O
carried O
forward O
with O
a O
look O
of O
cockney O
contempt O
. O
This O
combination O
at O
once O
tickled O
and O
terrified O
the O
nerves O
of O
a O
neurotic O
population O
. O
He O
seemed O
like O
a O
walking O
blasphemy O
, O
a O
blend O
of O
the O
angel O
and O
the O
ape O
. O
This O
particular O
evening O
, O
if O
it O
is O
remembered O
for O
nothing O
else O
, O
will O
be O
remembered O
in O
that O
place O
for O
its O
strange O
sunset O
. O
It O
looked O
like O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
. O
All O
the O
heaven O
seemed O
covered O
with O
a O
quite O
vivid O
and O
palpable O
plumage O
; O
you O
could O
only O
say O
that O
the O
sky O
was O
full O
of O
feathers O
, O
and O
of O
feathers O
that O
almost O
brushed O
the O
face O
. O
Across O
the O
great O
part O
of O
the O
dome O
they O
were O
grey O
, O
with O
the O
strangest O
tints O
of O
violet O
and O
mauve O
and O
an O
unnatural O
pink O
or O
pale O
green O
; O
but O
towards O
the O
west O
the O
whole O
grew O
past O
description O
, O
transparent O
and O
passionate O
, O
and O
the O
last O
red-hot O
plumes O
of O
it O
covered O
up O
the O
sun O
like O
something O
too O
good O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
The O
whole O
was O
so O
close O
about O
the O
earth O
, O
as O
to O
express O
nothing O
but O
a O
violent O
secrecy O
. O
The O
very O
empyrean O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
secret O
. O
It O
expressed O
that O
splendid O
smallness O
which O
is O
the O
soul O
of O
local O
patriotism O
. O
The O
very O
sky O
seemed O
small O
. O
I O
say O
that O
there O
are O
some O
inhabitants O
who O
may O
remember O
the O
evening O
if O
only O
by O
that O
oppressive O
sky O
. O
There O
are O
others O
who O
may O
remember O
it O
because O
it O
marked O
the O
first O
appearance O
in O
the O
place O
of O
the O
second O
poet O
of O
Saffron O
Park O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
the O
red-haired O
revolutionary O
had O
reigned O
without O
a O
rival O
; O
it O
was O
upon O
the O
night O
of O
the O
sunset O
that O
his O
solitude O
suddenly O
ended O
. O
The O
new O
poet O
, O
who O
introduced O
himself O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Gabriel O
Syme O
was O
a O
very O
mild-looking O
mortal O
, O
with O
a O
fair O
, O
pointed O
beard O
and O
faint O
, O
yellow O
hair O
. O
But O
an O
impression O
grew O
that O
he O
was O
less O
meek O
than O
he O
looked O
. O
He O
signalised O
his O
entrance O
by O
differing O
with O
the O
established O
poet O
, O
Gregory O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
nature O
of O
poetry O
. O
He O
said O
that O
he O
( O
Syme O
) O
was O
poet O
of O
law O
, O
a O
poet O
of O
order O
; O
nay O
, O
he O
said O
he O
was O
a O
poet O
of O
respectability O
. O
So O
all O
the O
Saffron O
Parkers O
looked O
at O
him O
as O
if O
he O
had O
that O
moment O
fallen O
out O
of O
that O
impossible O
sky O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
Mr. O
Lucian O
Gregory O
, O
the O
anarchic O
poet O
, O
connected O
the O
two O
events O
. O
" O
It O
may O
well O
be O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
in O
his O
sudden O
lyrical O
manner O
, O
" O
it O
may O
well O
be O
on O
such O
a O
night O
of O
clouds O
and O
cruel O
colours O
that O
there O
is O
brought O
forth O
upon O
the O
earth O
such O
a O
portent O
as O
a O
respectable O
poet O
. O
You O
say O
you O
are O
a O
poet O
of O
law O
; O
I O
say O
you O
are O
a O
contradiction O
in O
terms O
. O
I O
only O
wonder O
there O
were O
not O
comets O
and O
earthquakes O
on O
the O
night O
you O
appeared O
in O
this O
garden O
. O
" O
The O
man O
with O
the O
meek O
blue O
eyes O
and O
the O
pale O
, O
pointed O
beard O
endured O
these O
thunders O
with O
a O
certain O
submissive O
solemnity O
. O
The O
third O
party O
of O
the O
group O
, O
Gregory O
’s O
sister O
Rosamond O
, O
who O
had O
her O
brother O
’s O
braids O
of O
red O
hair O
, O
but O
a O
kindlier O
face O
underneath O
them O
, O
laughed O
with O
such O
mixture O
of O
admiration O
and O
disapproval O
as O
she O
gave O
commonly O
to O
the O
family O
oracle O
. O
Gregory O
resumed O
in O
high O
oratorical O
good O
humour O
. O
" O
An O
artist O
is O
identical O
with O
an O
anarchist O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
. O
" O
You O
might O
transpose O
the O
words O
anywhere O
. O
An O
anarchist O
is O
an O
artist O
. O
The O
man O
who O
throws O
a O
bomb O
is O
an O
artist O
, O
because O
he O
prefers O
a O
great O
moment O
to O
everything O
. O
He O
sees O
how O
much O
more O
valuable O
is O
one O
burst O
of O
blazing O
light O
, O
one O
peal O
of O
perfect O
thunder O
, O
than O
the O
mere O
common O
bodies O
of O
a O
few O
shapeless O
policemen O
. O
An O
artist O
disregards O
all O
governments O
, O
abolishes O
all O
conventions O
. O
The O
poet O
delights O
in O
disorder O
only O
. O
If O
it O
were O
not O
so O
, O
the O
most O
poetical O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
would O
be O
the O
Underground O
Railway O
. O
" O
" O
So O
it O
is O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Syme O
. O
" O
Nonsense O
! O
" O
said O
Gregory O
, O
who O
was O
very O
rational O
when O
anyone O
else O
attempted O
paradox O
. O
" O
Why O
do O
all O
the O
clerks O
and O
navvies O
in O
the O
railway O
trains O
look O
so O
sad O
and O
tired O
, O
so O
very O
sad O
and O
tired O
? O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
. O
It O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
the O
train O
is O
going O
right O
. O
It O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
whatever O
place O
they O
have O
taken O
a O
ticket O
for O
that O
place O
they O
will O
reach O
. O
It O
is O
because O
after O
they O
have O
passed O
Sloane O
Square O
they O
know O
that O
the O
next O
station O
must O
be O
Victoria O
, O
and O
nothing O
but O
Victoria O
. O
Oh O
, O
their O
wild O
rapture O
! O
oh O
, O
their O
eyes O
like O
stars O
and O
their O
souls O
again O
in O
Eden O
, O
if O
the O
next O
station O
were O
unaccountably O
Baker O
Street O
! O
" O
" O
It O
is O
you O
who O
are O
unpoetical O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
poet O
Syme O
. O
" O
If O
what O
you O
say O
of O
clerks O
is O
true O
, O
they O
can O
only O
be O
as O
prosaic O
as O
your O
poetry O
. O
The O
rare O
, O
strange O
thing O
is O
to O
hit O
the O
mark O
; O
the O
gross O
, O
obvious O
thing O
is O
to O
miss O
it O
. O
We O
feel O
it O
is O
epical O
when O
man O
with O
one O
wild O
arrow O
strikes O
a O
distant O
bird O
. O
Is O
it O
not O
also O
epical O
when O
man O
with O
one O
wild O
engine O
strikes O
a O
distant O
station O
? O
Chaos O
is O
dull O
; O
because O
in O
chaos O
the O
train O
might O
indeed O
go O
anywhere O
, O
to O
Baker O
Street O
or O
to O
Bagdad O
. O
But O
man O
is O
a O
magician O

and O
his O
whole O
magic O
is O
in O
this O
, O
that O
he O
does O
say O
Victoria O

lo O
! O
it O
is O
Victoria O

No O

take O
your O
books O

Gregory O
sarcastically O

" O
I O
tell O
you O

" O
went O
on O
Syme O
with O
passion O

" O
that O
every O
time O
a O
train O
comes O
in O
I O
feel O
that O
it O
has O
broken O
past O
batteries O
of O
besiegers O
, O
and O
that O
man O
has O
won O
a O
battle O
against O
chaos O
. O
You O
say O
contemptuously O
that O
when O
one O
has O
left O
Sloane O
Square O
one O
must O
come O
to O
Victoria O
. O
I O
say O
that O
one O
might O
do O
a O
thousand O
things O
instead O
, O
and O
that O
whenever O
I O
really O
come O
there O
I O
have O
the O
sense O
of O
hairbreadth O
escape O
. O
And O
when O
I O
hear O
the O
guard O
shout O
out O
the O
word O
‘ O
Victoria O
, O
’ O
it O
is O
not O
an O
unmeaning O
word O
. O
It O
is O
to O
me O
the O
cry O
of O
a O
herald O
announcing O
conquest O
. O
It O
is O
to O
me O
indeed O
‘ O
Victoria O
’ O
; O
it O
is O
the O
victory O
of O
Adam O
. O
" O
Gregory O
wagged O
his O
heavy O
, O
red O
head O
with O
a O
slow O
and O
sad O
smile O
. O
" O
And O
even O
then O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
we O
poets O
always O
ask O
the O
question O
, O
‘ O
And O
what O
is O
Victoria O
now O
that O
you O
have O
got O
there O
? O
’ O
You O
think O

We O
know O
that O
the O
New O
Jerusalem O

only O
be O

Yes O
, O
the O

will O
be O
discontented O

in O

The O
poet O
is O
always O
in O
revolt O

" O
" O
There O
again O

" O
said O
Syme O
irritably O
, O
" O
what O
is O
there O
poetical O
about O
being O
in O
revolt O
? O
You O
might O
as O
well O
say O
that O
it O
is O
poetical O
to O
be O
sea-sick O
. O
Being O
sick O
is O
a O
revolt O
. O
Both O
being O
sick O
and O
being O
rebellious O
may O
be O
the O
wholesome O
thing O
on O
certain O
desperate O
occasions O
; O
but O
I O
’m O
hanged O
if O
I O
can O
see O
why O
they O
are O
poetical O

Revolt O
in O
the O
abstract O

It O

" O
Belcour O
preferred O
the O

and O
they O
sauntered O
out O
to O
view O
the O
town O
, O
and O
to O
make O
remarks O
on O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
as O
they O
returned O
from O

. O
Montraville O
was O
a O
Lieutenant O
in O
the O
army O
: O
Belcour O
was O
his O
brother O
officer O
: O
they O
had O
been O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
their O
friends O
previous O
to O
their O
departure O
for O
America O
, O
and O
were O
now O
returning O
to O
Portsmouth O
, O
where O
the O
troops O
waited O
orders O
for O
embarkation O
. O
They O
had O
stopped O
at O
Chichester O
to O
dine O
; O
and O
knowing O
they O
had O
sufficient O
time O
to O
reach O
the O
place O
of O
destination O
before O
dark O
, O
and O
yet O
allow O
them O
a O
walk O
, O
had O
resolved O
, O
it O
being O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
to O
take O
a O
survey O
of O
the O
Chichester O
ladies O
as O
they O
returned O
from O
their O
devotions O
. O
They O
had O
gratified O
their O
curiosity O
, O
and O
were O
preparing O
to O
return O
to O
the O
inn O
without O
honouring O
any O
of O
the O
belles O
with O
particular O
notice O
, O
when O
Madame O
Du O
Pont O
, O
at O
the O
head O
of O
her O
school O
, O
descended O
from O
the O
church O
. O
Such O
an O
assemblage O
of O
youth O
and O
innocence O
naturally O
attracted O
the O
young O
soldiers O
: O
they O
stopped O
; O
and O
, O
as O
the O
little O
cavalcade O
passed O
, O
almost O
involuntarily O
pulled O
off O
their O
hats O
. O
A O
tall O
, O
elegant O
girl O
looked O
at O
Montraville O
and O
blushed O
: O
he O
instantly O
recollected O
the O
features O
of O
Charlotte O
Temple O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
once O
seen O
and O
danced O
with O
at O
a O
ball O
at O
Portsmouth O
. O
At O
that O
time O
he O
thought O
on O
her O
only O
as O
a O
very O
lovely O
child O
, O
she O
being O
then O
only O
thirteen O
; O
but O
the O
improvement O
two O
years O
had O
made O
in O
her O
person O
, O
and O
the O
blush O
of O
recollection O
which O
suffused O
her O
cheeks O
as O
she O
passed O
, O
awakened O
in O
his O
bosom O
new O
and O
pleasing O
ideas O
. O
Vanity O
led O
him O
to O
think O
that O
pleasure O
at O
again O
beholding O
him O
might O
have O
occasioned O
the O
emotion O
he O
had O
witnessed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
vanity O
led O
him O
to O
wish O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O
" O
She O
is O
the O
sweetest O
girl O
in O
the O
world O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
entered O
the O
inn O
. O
Belcour O
stared O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
notice O
her O
? O
" O
continued O
Montraville O
: O
" O
she O
had O
on O
a O
blue O
bonnet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
lovely O
eyes O
of O
the O
same O
colour O
, O
has O
contrived O
to O
make O
me O
feel O
devilish O
odd O
about O
the O
heart O
. O
" O
" O
Pho O
, O
" O
said O
Belcour O
, O
" O
a O
musket O
ball O
from O
our O
friends O
, O
the O
Americans O
, O
may O
in O
less O
than O
two O
months O
make O
you O
feel O
worse O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
think O
of O
the O
future O
, O
" O
replied O
Montraville O
; O
" O
but O
am O
determined O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
the O
present O
, O
and O
would O
willingly O
compound O
with O
any O
kind O
Familiar O
who O
would O
inform O
me O
who O
the O
girl O
is O
, O
and O
how O
I O
might O
be O
likely O
to O
obtain O
an O
interview O
. O
" O
But O
no O
kind O
Familiar O
at O
that O
time O
appearing O
, O
and O
the O
chaise O
which O
they O
had O
ordered O
, O
driving O
up O
to O
the O
door O
, O
Montraville O
and O
his O
companion O
were O
obliged O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
Chichester O
and O
its O
fair O
inhabitant O
, O
and O
proceed O
on O
their O
journey O
. O
But O
Charlotte O
had O
made O
too O
great O
an O
impression O
on O
his O
mind O
to O
be O
easily O
eradicated O
: O
having O
therefore O
spent O
three O
whole O
days O
in O
thinking O
on O
her O
and O
in O
endeavouring O
to O
form O
some O
plan O
for O
seeing O
her O
, O
he O
determined O
to O
set O
off O
for O
Chichester O
, O
and O
trust O
to O
chance O
either O
to O
favour O
or O
frustrate O
his O
designs O
. O
Arriving O
at O
the O
verge O
of O
the O
town O
, O
he O
dismounted O
, O
and O
sending O
the O
servant O
forward O
with O
the O
horses O
, O
proceeded O
toward O
the O
place O
, O
where O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
an O
extensive O
pleasure O
ground O
, O
stood O
the O
mansion O
which O
contained O
the O
lovely O
Charlotte O
Temple O
. O
Montraville O
leaned O
on O
a O
broken O
gate O
, O
and O
looked O
earnestly O
at O
the O
house O
. O
The O
wall O
which O
surrounded O
it O
was O
high O
, O
and O
perhaps O
the O
Argus O
’s O
who O
guarded O
the O
Hesperian O
fruit O
within O
, O
were O
more O
watchful O
than O
those O
famed O
of O
old O
. O
"‘ O
Tis O
a O
romantic O
attempt O
, O
" O
said O
he O
; O
" O
and O
should O
I O
even O
succeed O
in O
seeing O
and O
conversing O
with O
her O
, O
it O
can O
be O
productive O
of O
no O
good O
: O
I O
must O
of O
necessity O
leave O
England O
in O
a O
few O
days O
, O
and O
probably O
may O
never O
return O
; O
why O
then O
should O
I O
endeavour O
to O
engage O
the O
affections O
of O
this O
lovely O
girl O
, O
only O
to O
leave O
her O
a O
prey O
to O
a O
thousand O
inquietudes O
, O
of O
which O
at O
present O
she O
has O
no O
idea O
? O
I O
will O
return O
to O
Portsmouth O
and O
think O
no O
more O
about O
her O
. O
" O
The O
evening O
now O
was O
closed O
; O
a O
serene O
stillness O
reigned O
; O
and O
the O
chaste O
Queen O
of O
Night O
with O
her O
silver O
crescent O
faintly O
illuminated O
the O
hemisphere O
. O
The O
mind O
of O
Montraville O
was O
hushed O
into O
composure O
by O
the O
serenity O
of O
the O
surrounding O
objects O
. O
" O
I O
will O
think O
on O
her O
no O
more O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
and O
turned O
with O
an O
intention O
to O
leave O
the O
place O
; O
but O
as O
he O
turned O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
gate O
which O
led O
to O
the O
pleasure O
grounds O
open O
, O
and O
two O
women O
come O
out O
, O
who O
walked O
arm-in-arm O
across O
the O
field O
. O
" O
I O
will O
at O
least O
see O
who O
these O
are O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
He O
overtook O
them O
, O
and O
giving O
them O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
begged O
leave O
to O
see O
them O
into O
the O
more O
frequented O
parts O
of O
the O
town O
: O
but O
how O
was O
he O
delighted O
, O
when O
, O
waiting O
for O
an O
answer O
, O
he O
discovered O
, O
under O
the O
concealment O
of O
a O
large O
bonnet O
, O
the O
face O
of O
Charlotte O
Temple O
. O
He O
soon O
found O
means O
to O
ingratiate O
himself O
with O
her O
companion O
, O
who O
was O
a O
French O
teacher O
at O
the O
school O
, O
and O
, O
at O
parting O
, O
slipped O
a O
letter O

had O
purposely O
written O
, O
into O
Charlotte O
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
five O
guineas O
into O
that O
of O
Mademoiselle O

who O
promised O

her O

DOMESTIC O
CONCERNS O
. O
MR. O
Temple O
was O
the O
youngest O
son O
of O
a O
nobleman O
whose O
fortune O
was O
by O
no O
means O
adequate O
to O
the O
antiquity O
, O
grandeur O
, O
and O
I O
may O
add O
, O
pride O
of O
the O
family O
. O
He O
saw O
his O
elder O
brother O
made O
completely O
wretched O
by O
marrying O
a O
disagreeable O
woman O
, O
whose O
fortune O
helped O
to O
prop O
the O
sinking O
dignity O
of O
the O
house O
; O
and O
he O
beheld O
his O
sisters O
legally O
prostituted O
to O
old O
, O
decrepid O
men O
, O
whose O
titles O
gave O
them O
consequence O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
whose O
affluence O
rendered O
them O
splendidly O
miserable O
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
sacrifice O
internal O
happiness O
for O
outward O
shew O
, O
" O

he O
: O
" O
I O
will O
seek O
Content O
; O
and O
, O
if O
I O
find O
her O
in O
a O
cottage O
, O
will O
embrace O
her O
with O
as O
much O
cordiality O
as O
I O
should O
if O
seated O
on O
a O
throne O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Temple O
possessed O
a O
small O
estate O
of O
about O
five O
hundred O
pounds O
a O
year O
; O
and O
with O
that O
he O
resolved O
to O
preserve O
independence O
, O
to O
marry O
where O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
heart O
should O
direct O
him O
, O
and O
to O
confine O
his O
expenses O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
his O
income O
. O
He O
had O
a O
heart O
open O
to O
every O
generous O
feeling O
of O
humanity O
, O
and O
a O
hand O
ready O
to O
dispense O
to O
those O
who O
wanted O
part O
of O
the O
blessings O
he O
enjoyed O
himself O
. O
As O
he O
was O
universally O
known O
to O
be O
the O
friend O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
, O
his O
advice O
and O
bounty O
was O
frequently O
solicited O
; O
nor O
was O
it O
seldom O
that O
he O
sought O
out O
indigent O
merit O
, O
and O
raised O
it O
from O
obscurity O
, O
confining O
his O
own O
expenses O
within O
a O
very O
narrow O
compass O
. O
" O
You O
are O
a O
benevolent O
fellow O
, O
" O
said O
a O
young O
officer O
to O
him O
one O
day O
; O
" O
and O
I O
have O
a O
great O
mind O
to O
give O
you O
a O
fine O
subject O

exercise O

goodness O
of O
your O
heart O
upon O
. O
" O
" O
You O
can O
not O
oblige O
me O
more O
, O
" O
said O
Temple O
, O
" O
than O
to O
point O
out O
any O
way O
by O
which O
I O
can O
be O
serviceable O
to O
my O
fellow O
creatures O
. O
" O
" O
Come O
along O
then O
, O
" O
said O
the O
young O
man O
, O
" O
we O
will O
go O
and O
visit O
a O
man O
who O
is O
not O
in O
so O
good O
a O
lodging O
as O
he O
deserves O
; O
and O
, O
were O
it O
not O
that O
he O
has O
an O
angel O
with O
him O
, O
who O
comforts O
and O
supports O
him O
, O
he O
must O
long O
since O
have O
sunk O
under O
his O
misfortunes O
. O
" O
The O
young O
man O
’s O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
proceed O
; O
and O
Temple O
, O
unwilling O
to O
irritate O
his O
feelings O
by O
making O
further O
enquiries O
, O
followed O
him O
in O
silence O
, O
til O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
Fleet O
prison O
. O
The O
officer O
enquired O
for O
Captain O
Eldridge O
: O
a O
person O
led O
them O
up O
several O
pair O
of O
dirty O
stairs O
, O
and O
pointing O
to O
a O
door O
which O
led O
to O
a O
miserable O
, O
small O
apartment O
, O
said O
that O
was O
the O
Captain O
’s O
room O
, O
and O
retired O
. O
The O
officer O
, O
whose O
name O
was O
Blakeney O
, O
tapped O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
was O
bid O
to O
enter O
by O
a O
voice O
melodiously O
soft O
. O
He O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
discovered O
to O
Temple O
a O
scene O
which O
rivetted O
him O
to O
the O
spot O
with O
astonishment O
. O
The O
apartment O
, O
though O
small O
, O
and O
bearing O
strong O
marks O
of O
poverty O
, O
was O
neat O
in O
the O
extreme O
. O
In O
an O
arm-chair O
, O
his O
head O
reclined O
upon O
his O
hand O
, O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
a O
book O
which O
lay O
open O
before O
him O
, O
sat O
an O
aged O
man O
in O
a O
Lieutenant O
’s O
uniform O
, O
which O
, O
though O
threadbare O
, O
would O
sooner O
call O
a O
blush O
of O
shame O
into O
the O
face O
of O
those O
who O
could O
neglect O
real O
merit O
, O
than O
cause O
the O
hectic O
of O
confusion O
to O
glow O
on O
the O
cheeks O
of O
him O
who O
wore O
it O
. O
Beside O
him O
sat O
a O
lovely O
creature O
busied O
in O
painting O
a O
fan O
mount O
. O
She O
was O
fair O
as O
the O
lily O
, O
but O
sorrow O
had O
nipped O
the O
rose O
in O
her O
cheek O
before O
it O
was O

Her O
eyes O
were O
blue O
; O
and O
her O
hair O
, O
which O
was O
light O
brown O
, O
was O
slightly O
confined O
under O
a O
plain O
muslin O
cap O
, O
tied O
round O
with O
a O
black O
ribbon O
; O
a O
white O
linen O
gown O
and O
plain O
lawn O
handkerchief O
composed O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
dress O
; O
and O
in O
this O
simple O
attire O
, O
she O
was O
more O
irresistibly O
charming O
to O
such O
a O
heart O
as O
Temple O
’s O
, O
than O
she O
would O
have O
been O
, O
if O
adorned O
with O
all O
the O
splendor O
of O
a O
courtly O
belle O
. O
When O
they O
entered O
, O
the O
old O
man O
arose O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
shaking O
Blakeney O
by O
the O
hand O
with O
great O
cordiality O
, O
offered O
Temple O
his O
chair O
; O
and O
there O
being O
but O
three O
in O
the O
room O
, O
seated O
himself O
on O
the O
side O
of O
his O
little O
bed O
with O
evident O
composure O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
strange O
place O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
Temple O
, O
" O
to O
receive O
visitors O
of O
distinction O
in O
; O
but O
we O
must O
fit O
our O
feelings O
to O
our O
station O
. O
While O
I O
am O
not O
ashamed O
to O
own O
the O
cause O
which O
brought O
me O
here O
, O
why O
should O
I O
blush O
at O
my O
situation O
? O
Our O
misfortunes O
are O
not O
our O
faults O
; O
and O
were O
it O
not O
for O
that O
poor O
girl O
-- O
" O
Here O
the O
philosopher O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
father O
. O
He O
rose O
hastily O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
walking O
toward O
the O
window O
, O
wiped O
off O
a O
tear O
which O
he O
was O
afraid O
would O
tarnish O
the O
cheek O
of O
a O
sailor O
. O
Temple O
cast O
his O
eye O
on O
Miss O
Eldridge O
: O
a O
pellucid O
drop O
had O
stolen O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
fallen O
upon O
a O
rose O

was O
painting O
. O
It O
blotted O
and O
discoloured O
the O
flower O

" O
said O
he O
mentally O
: O
" O
the O
rose O
of O
youth O

health O
soon O
fades O
when O
watered O
by O
the O
tear O
of O
affliction O

CHAPTER O
1 O
The O
studio O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
rich O
odour O
of O
roses O
, O
and O
when O
the O
light O
summer O
wind O
stirred O
amidst O
the O
trees O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
there O
came O
through O
the O
open O
door O
the O
heavy O
scent O
of O
the O
lilac O
, O
or O
the O
more O
delicate O
perfume O
of O
the O
pink-flowering O
thorn O
. O
From O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
divan O
of O
Persian O
saddle-bags O
on O
which O
he PRON_PER
was O
lying O
, O
smoking O
, O
as O
was O
his PRON_PER
custom O
, O
innumerable O
cigarettes O
, O
Lord PROP_PER
Henry PROP_PER
Wotton PROP_PER
could O
just O
catch O
the O
gleam O
of O
the O
honey-sweet O
and O
honey-coloured O
blossoms O
of O
a O
laburnum O
, O
whose O
tremulous O
branches O
seemed O
hardly O
able O
to O
bear O
the O
burden O
of O
a O
beauty O
so O
flamelike O
as O
theirs O
; O
and O
now O
and O
then O
the O
fantastic O
shadows O
of O
birds O
in O
flight O
flitted O
across O
the O
long O
tussore-silk O
curtains O
that O
were O
stretched O
in O
front O
of O
the O
huge O
window O
, O
producing O
a O
kind O
of O
momentary O
Japanese O
effect O
, O
and O
making O
him PRON_PER
think O
of O
those O
pallid O
, O
jade-faced O
painters O
of O
Tokyo O
who O
, O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
an O
art O
that O
is O
necessarily O
immobile O
, O
seek O
to O
convey O
the O
sense O
of O
swiftness O
and O
motion O
. O
The O
sullen O
murmur O
of O
the O
bees O
shouldering O
their O
way O
through O
the O
long O
unmown O
grass O
, O
or O
circling O
with O
monotonous O
insistence O
round O
the O
dusty O
gilt O
horns O
of O
the O
straggling O
woodbine O
, O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
stillness O
more O
oppressive O
. O
The O
dim O
roar O
of O
London O
was O
like O
the O
bourdon O
note O
of O
a O
distant O
organ O
. O
In O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room O
, O
clamped O
to O
an O
upright O
easel O
, O
stood O
the O
full-length O
portrait O
of O
a NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
extraordinary NOM_PER
personal NOM_PER
beauty NOM_PER
, O
and O
in O
front O
of O
it O
, O
some O
little O
distance O
away O
, O
was O
sitting O
the NOM_PER
artist NOM_PER
himself NOM_PER
, O
Basil O
Hallward O
, O
whose O
sudden O
disappearance O
some O
years O
ago O
caused O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
such O
public O
excitement O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
so O
many O
strange O
conjectures O
. O
As O
the O
painter O
looked O
at O
the O
gracious O
and O
comely O
form O
he O
had O
so O
skilfully O
mirrored O
in O
his O
art O
, O
a O
smile O
of O
pleasure O
passed O
across O
his O
face O
, O
and O
seemed O
about O
to O
linger O
there O
. O
But O
he O
suddenly O
started O
up O
, O
and O
closing O
his O
eyes O
, O
placed O
his O
fingers O
upon O
the O
lids O
, O
as O
though O
he O
sought O
to O
imprison O
within O
his O
brain O
some O
curious O
dream O
from O
which O
he O
feared O
he O
might O
awake O
. O
" O
It O
is O
your O
best O
work O
, O
Basil O
, O
the O
best O
thing O
you O
have O
ever O
done O
, O
" O
said O
Lord O
Henry O
languidly O
. O
" O
You O
must O
certainly O
send O
it O
next O
year O
to O
the O
Grosvenor O
. O
The O
Academy O
is O
too O
large O
and O
too O
vulgar O
. O
Whenever O
I O
have O
gone O
there O
, O
there O
have O
been O
either O
so O
many O
people O
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
see O
the O
pictures O
, O
which O
was O
dreadful O
, O
or O
so O
many O
pictures O
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
see O
the O
people O
, O
which O
was O
worse O
. O
The O
Grosvenor O
is O
really O
the O
only O
place O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
shall O
send O
it O
anywhere O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
tossing O
his O
head O
back O
in O
that O
odd O
way O
that O
used O
to O
make O
his O
friends O
laugh O
at O
him O
at O
Oxford O
. O
" O
No O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
send O
it O
anywhere O
. O
" O
Lord O
Henry O
elevated O
his O
eyebrows O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
in O
amazement O
through O
the O
thin O
blue O
wreaths O
of O
smoke O
that O
curled O
up O
in O
such O
fanciful O
whorls O
from O
his O
heavy O
, O
opium-tainted O
cigarette O
. O
" O
Not O
send O
it O
anywhere O
? O
My O
dear O
fellow O
, O
why O
? O
Have O
you O
any O
reason O
? O
What O
odd O
chaps O
you O
painters O
are O
! O
You O
do O
anything O
in O
the O
world O
to O
gain O
a O
reputation O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
have O
one O
, O
you O
seem O
to O
want O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
. O
It O
is O
silly O
of O
you O
, O
for O
there O
is O
only O
one O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
worse O
than O
being O
talked O
about O
, O
and O
that O
is O
not O
being O
talked O
about O
. O
A O
portrait O
like O
this O
would O
set O
you O
far O
above O
all O
the O
young O
men O
in O
England O
, O
and O
make O
the O
old O
men O
quite O
jealous O
, O
if O
old O
men O
are O
ever O
capable O
of O
any O
emotion O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
you O
will O
laugh O
at O
me O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
but O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
exhibit O
it O
. O
I O
have O
put O
too O
much O
of O
myself O
into O
it O
. O
" O
Lord O
Henry O
stretched O
himself O
out O
on O
the O
divan O
and O
laughed O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
knew O
you O
would O
; O
but O
it O
is O
quite O
true O
, O
all O
the O
same O
. O
" O
" O
Too O
much O
of O
yourself O
in O
it O
! O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Basil O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
you O
were O
so O
vain O
; O
and O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
see O
any O
resemblance O
between O
you O
, O
with O
your O
rugged O
strong O
face O
and O
your O
coal-black O
hair O
, O
and O
this O
young O
Adonis O
, O
who O
looks O
as O
if O
he O
was O
made O
out O
of O
ivory O
and O
rose-leaves O
. O
Why O
, O
my O
dear O
Basil O
, O
he O
is O
a O
Narcissus O
, O
and O
you O
-- O
well O
, O
of O
course O
you O
have O
an O
intellectual O
expression O
and O
all O
that O
. O
But O
beauty O
, O
real O
beauty O
, O
ends O
where O
an O
intellectual O
expression O
begins O
. O
Intellect O
is O
in O
itself O
a O
mode O
of O
exaggeration O
, O
and O
destroys O
the O
harmony O
of O
any O
face O
. O
The O
moment O
one O
sits O
down O
to O
think O
, O
one O
becomes O
all O
nose O
, O
or O
all O
forehead O
, O
or O
something O
horrid O
. O
Look O
at O
the O
successful O
men O
in O
any O
of O
the O
learned O
professions O
. O
How O
perfectly O
hideous O
they O
are O
! O
Except O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
the O
Church O
. O
But O
then O
in O
the O
Church O
they O
do O
n't O
think O
. O
A O
bishop O
keeps O
on O
saying O
at O
the O
age O
of O
eighty O
what O
he O
was O
told O
to O
say O
when O
he O
was O
a O
boy O
of O
eighteen O
, O
and O
as O
a O
natural O
consequence O
he O
always O
looks O
absolutely O
delightful O
. O
Your O
mysterious O
young O
friend O
, O
whose O
name O
you O
have O
never O
told O
me O
, O
but O
whose O
picture O
really O
fascinates O
me O
, O
never O
thinks O
. O
I O
feel O
quite O
sure O
of O
that O
. O
He O
is O
some O
brainless O
beautiful O
creature O
who O
should O
be O
always O
here O
in O
winter O
when O
we O
have O
no O
flowers O
to O
look O
at O
, O
and O
always O
here O
in O
summer O
when O
we O
want O
something O
to O
chill O
our O
intelligence O
. O
Do O
n't O
flatter O
yourself O
, O
Basil O
: O
you O
are O
not O
in O
the O
least O
like O
him O
. O
" O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
understand O
me O
, O
Harry O
, O
" O
answered O
the O
artist O
. O
" O
Of O
course O
I O
am O
not O
like O
him O
. O
I O
know O
that O
perfectly O
well O
. O
Indeed O
, O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
look O
like O
him O
. O
You O
shrug O
your O
shoulders O
? O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
the O
truth O
. O
There O
is O
a O
fatality O
about O
all O
physical O
and O
intellectual O
distinction O
, O
the O
sort O
of O
fatality O
that O
seems O
to O
dog O
through O
history O
the O
faltering O
steps O
of O
kings O
. O
It O
is O
better O
not O
to O
be O
different O
from O
one O
's O
fellows O
. O
The O
ugly O
and O
the O
stupid O
have O
the O
best O
of O
it O
in O
this O
world O
. O
They O
can O
sit O
at O
their O
ease O
and O
gape O
at O
the O
play O
. O
If O
they O
know O
nothing O
of O
victory O
, O
they O
are O
at O
least O
spared O
the O
knowledge O
of O
defeat O
. O
They O
live O
as O
we O
all O
should O
live O
-- O
undisturbed O
, O
indifferent O
, O
and O
without O
disquiet O
. O
They O
neither O
bring O
ruin O
upon O
others O
, O
nor O
ever O
receive O
it O
from O
alien O
hands O
. O
Your O
rank O
and O
wealth O
, O
Harry O
; O
my O
brains O

such O
as O
they O
are O

my O

whatever O
it O

all O

terribly O

" O
" O
Dorian O
Gray O
? O
Is O
that O
his O
name O
? O
" O
asked O
Lord O
Henry O
, O
walking O
across O
the O
studio O
towards O
Basil O
Hallward O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
that O
is O
his O
name O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
intend O
to O
tell O
it O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
But O
why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
explain O
. O
When O
I O
like O
people O
immensely O
, O
I O
never O
tell O
their O
names O
to O
any O
one O
. O
It O
is O
like O
surrendering O
a O
part O
of O
them O
. O
I O
have O
grown O
to O
love O
secrecy O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
one O
thing O
that O
can O
make O
modern O
life O
mysterious O
or O
marvellous O
to O
us O
. O
The O
commonest O
thing O
is O
delightful O
if O
one O
only O
hides O
it O
. O
When O
I O
leave O
town O
now O
I O
never O
tell O
my O
people O
where O
I O
am O
going O
. O
If O
I O
did O
, O
I O
would O
lose O
all O
my O
pleasure O
. O
It O
is O
a O
silly O
habit O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
but O
somehow O
it O
seems O
to O
bring O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
romance O
into O
one O
's O
life O
. O
I O
suppose O
you O
think O
me O
awfully O
foolish O
about O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
" O
answered O
Lord O
Henry O
, O
" O
not O
at O
all O
, O
my O
dear O
Basil O
. O
You O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
I O
am O
married O
, O
and O
the O
one O
charm O
of O
marriage O
is O
that O
it O
makes O
a O
life O
of O
deception O
absolutely O
necessary O
for O
both O
parties O
. O
I O
never O
know O
where O
my O
wife O
is O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
never O
knows O
what O
I O
am O
doing O
. O
When O
we O
meet O
-- O
we O
do O
meet O
occasionally O
, O
when O
we O
dine O
out O
together O
, O
or O
go O
down O
to O
the O
Duke O
's O
-- O
we O
tell O
each O
other O
the O
most O
absurd O
stories O
with O
the O
most O
serious O
faces O
. O
My O
wife O
is O
very O
good O
at O
it O
-- O
much O
better O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
than O
I O
am O
. O
She O
never O
gets O
confused O
over O
her O
dates O
, O
and O
I O
always O
do O
. O
But O
when O
she O
does O
find O
me O
out O
, O
she O
makes O
no O
row O
at O
all O
. O
I O
sometimes O
wish O
she O
would O
; O
but O
she O
merely O
laughs O
at O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
hate O
the O
way O
you O
talk O
about O
your O
married O
life O
, O
Harry O
, O
" O
said O
Basil O
Hallward O
, O
strolling O
towards O
the O
door O
that O
led O
into O
the O
garden O
. O
" O
I O
believe O
that O
you O
are O
really O
a O
very O
good O
husband O
, O
but O
that O
you O
are O
thoroughly O
ashamed O
of O
your O
own O
virtues O
. O
You O
are O
an O
extraordinary O
fellow O
. O
You O
never O
say O
a O
moral O
thing O
, O
and O
you O
never O
do O
a O
wrong O
thing O
. O
Your O
cynicism O

Being O
natural O
is O
simply O
a O
pose O

and O
the O
most O
irritating O
pose O
I O
know O
, O
" O
cried O
Lord O
Henry O
, O
laughing O
; O
and O
the O
two O
young O
men O
went O
out O
into O
the O
garden O
together O
and O
ensconced O
themselves O
on O
a O
long O
bamboo O
seat O
that O
stood O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
tall O
laurel O
bush O
. O
The O
sunlight O
slipped O
over O
the O
polished O
leaves O
. O
In O
the O
grass O
, O
white O
daisies O
were O
tremulous O
. O
After O
a O
pause O
, O
Lord O
Henry O
pulled O
out O
his O
watch O
. O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
must O
be O
going O
, O
Basil O
, O
" O
he O
murmured O
, O
" O
and O
before O
I O
go O
, O
I O
insist O
on O
your O
answering O
a O
question O
I O
put O
to O
you O
some O
time O
ago O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
that O
? O
" O
said O
the O
painter O
, O
keeping O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
You O
know O
quite O
well O

" O
I O
do O
not O
, O
Harry O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
is O
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
why O
you O
wo O
n't O
exhibit O
Dorian O
Gray O
's O
picture O
. O
I O
want O
the O
real O
reason O
. O
" O
" O
I O
told O
you O
the O
real O
reason O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
you O
did O
not O
. O
You O
said O
it O
was O
because O
there O
was O
too O
much O
of O
yourself O
in O
it O
. O
Now O
, O
that O
is O
childish O
. O
" O
" O
Harry O
, O
" O
said O
Basil O
Hallward O
, O
looking O
him O
straight O
in O
the O
face O
, O
" O
every O
portrait O
that O
is O
painted O
with O
feeling O
is O
a O
portrait O
of O
the O
artist O
, O
not O
of O
the O
sitter O
. O
The O
sitter O
is O
merely O
the O
accident O
, O
the O
occasion O
. O
It O
is O
not O
he O
who O
is O
revealed O
by O
the O
painter O
; O
it O
is O
rather O
the O
painter O
who O
, O
on O
the O
coloured O
canvas O
, O
reveals O
himself O
. O
The O
reason O
I O
will O
not O
exhibit O
this O
picture O
is O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
have O
shown O
in O
it O
the O
secret O
of O
my O
own O
soul O
. O
" O
Lord O
Henry O
laughed O
. O
" O
And O
what O
is O
that O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
I O
will O
tell O
you O

an O
expression O
of O
perplexity O
came O
over O

John O

paused O
sadly O
, O
then O
resumed O
: O
" O
If O
he O
had O
died O
, O
I O
might O
, O
as O
you O

he O
was O
abducted O
at O
the O
age O
of O
four O
by O
a O
revengeful O
servant O
whom O
I O
had O
discharged O
from O

Heaven O
knows O
whether O
he O
is O

it O
is O
impressed O
upon O
my O
mind O
that O
he O

it O
may O
be O
in O
misery O

it O
may O
be O
as O
a O

" O
Florence O
Linden O
sank O
impulsively O
on O
her O
knees O
beside O
her O
uncle O

chair O
. O
" O
Do O

say O
that O

And O
I O

too O

" O
There O
was O
a O
shade O
of O
jealousy O
in O
the O
voice O
of O
Curtis O
Waring O
as O
he O
entered O
the O
library O
through O
the O
open O
door O
, O
and O
approaching O
his O
uncle O
, O
pressed O
his O
hand O
. O
He O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
dark-complexioned O
man O
, O
of O
perhaps O
thirty-five O
, O
with O
shifty O
, O
black O
eyes O
and O
thin O
lips O
, O
shaded O
by O
a O
dark O
mustache O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
face O
to O
trust O
. O
Even O
when O
he O
smiled O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
face O
did O
not O
soften O
. O
Yet O
he O
could O
moderate O
his O
voice O
so O
as O
to O
express O
tenderness O
and O
sympathy O
. O
He O
was O
the O
son O
of O
an O
elder O
sister O
of O
Mr. O
Linden O
, O
while O
Florence O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
younger O
brother O
. O
Both O
were O
orphans O
, O
and O
both O
formed O
a O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Linden O
's O
household O
, O
and O
owed O
everything O
to O
his O
bounty O
. O
Curtis O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
in O
some O
business O
downtown O
; O
but O
he O
received O
a O
liberal O
allowance O
from O
his O
uncle O
, O
and O
often O
drew O
upon O
him O
for O
outside O
assistance O
. O
As O
he O
stood O
with O
his O
uncle O
's O
hand O
in O
his O
, O
he O
was O
necessarily O
brought O
near O
Florence O
, O
who O
instinctively O
drew O
a O
little O
away O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
shudder O
indicating O
repugnance O
. O
Slight O
as O
it O
was O
, O
Curtis O
detected O
it O
, O
and O
his O
face O
darkened O
. O
John O
Linden O
looked O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
I O
have O
a O
nephew O

a O
niece O

You O
are O
both O
dear O

no O

take O
the O
place O

it O

fourteen O

is O
fourteen O

long O

no O

John O
Linden O
, O
vehemently O

" O

do O
not O
, O
I O
will O
not O
, O
believe O
it O

still O
lives O
, O

I O
live O
only O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
one O
day O
clasping O
him O
in O
my O
arms O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
very O
improbable O
, O
uncle O
, O
" O
said O
Curtis O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
annoyance O
. O
" O
There O
is O
n't O
one O
chance O
in O
a O
hundred O
that O
my O
cousin O
still O
lives O

The O
grave O
has O
closed O
over O
him O
long O
since O
. O
The O
sooner O
you O
make O
up O
your O
mind O
to O
accept O
the O
inevitable O
the O
better O
. O
" O
The O
drawn O
features O
of O
the O
old O
man O
showed O
that O
the O
words O
had O
a O
depressing O
effect O
upon O
his O
mind O
, O
but O
Florence O
interrupted O
her O
cousin O
with O
an O
indignant O
protest O
. O
" O
How O
can O
you O
speak O
so O
, O
Curtis O
? O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
. O
" O
Leave O
Uncle O

the O
hope O
that O

so O
long O
cherished O

a O
presentiment O

brightened O
up O

eagerly O

probable O

old O
would O
Harvey O
be O
if O
he O
still O
lived O
? O
" O
" O
Eighteen O
-- O
nearly O
a O
year O
older O
than O
yourself O

" O
" O
How O
strange O

I O
always O
think O
of O
him O
as O
a O
little O
boy O

I O
, O
too O
, O
Florence O

He O
rises O
before O
me O
in O
his O
little O
velvet O
suit O
, O
as O
he O
was O
when O
I O
last O
saw O
him O
, O
with O
his O
sweet O
, O
boyish O
face O

in O
which O
his O
mother O

looks O
were O
reflected O

harshly O

rough O

serving O
his O
time O
at O
Blackwell O

, O
a O
hardened O
young O

it O
would O
be O
bitter O
mortification O

the O
sorrowful O
part O

in O
a O
voice O
of O
anguish O

most O
dread O

indignantly O

" O
Indeed O

sinking O
his O
voice O
into O
softly O
modulated O
accents O

coldly O

rising O
from O

aloof O

Mr. O
Linden O
, O
wearily O
. O
" O
Curtis O
, O
will O
you O
ring O
the O
bell O
? O
I O
am O
tired O

eagerly O

" O
It O

too O
much O

more O
helpless O

I O

said O
Curtis O
. O
John O
Linden O
, O
supported O
on O
either O
side O
by O
his O
nephew O
and O
niece O
, O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
was O
assisted O
to O
his O
chamber O
. O
Curtis O
and O
Florence O
returned O
to O
the O
library O
. O
" O
Florence O
, O
" O
said O
her O
cousin O
, O
" O
my O
uncle O
's O
intentions O
, O
as O
expressed O
to-night O
, O
make O
it O
desirable O
that O
there O
should O
be O
an O
understanding O
between O
us O
. O
Take O
a O
seat O
beside O
me O
" O
-- O
leading O
her O
to O
a O
sofa O

" O
and O
let O
us O
talk O
this O
matter O
over O
. O
" O
With O
a O
gesture O
of O
repulsion O
Florence O
declined O
the O
proffered O
seat O
, O
and O
remained O
standing O
. O
" O
As O
you O
please O
, O
" O
she O
answered O
, O
coldly O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
be O
seated O
? O
" O
" O
No O
; O
our O
interview O
will O
be O
brief O

" O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
come O
to O
the O
point O

Uncle O
John O
wishes O
to O
see O
us O
united O
. O
" O
" O
It O
can O
never O
be O
! O
" O
said O
Florence O
, O
decidedly O
. O
Curtis O
bit O
his O
lip O
in O
mortification O
, O
for O
her O
tone O
was O
cold O
and O
scornful O
. O
Mingled O
with O
this O
mortification O
was O
genuine O
regret O
, O
for O
, O
so O
far O
as O
he O
was O
capable O
of O
loving O
any O
one O

loved O

it O
his O

There O

more O

once O

CHAPTER O
I O
A NOM_PER
RED-HAIRED NOM_PER
GIRL NOM_PER
The O
residence O
of O
Mr. PROP_PER
Peter PROP_PER
Pett PROP_PER
, O
the NOM_PER
well-known NOM_PER
financier NOM_PER
, O
on O
Riverside O
Drive O
is O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
eyesores O
of O
that O
breezy O
and O
expensive O
boulevard O
. O
As O
you PRON_PER
pass O
by O
in O
your PRON_PER
limousine O
, O
or O
while O
enjoying O
ten O
cents O
worth O
of O
fresh O
air O
on O
top O
of O
a O
green O
omnibus O
, O
it O
jumps O
out O
and O
bites O
at O
you PRON_PER
. O
Architects NOM_PER
, O
confronted O
with O
it O
, O
reel O
and O
throw O
up O
their PRON_PER
hands O
defensively O
, O
and O
even O
the NOM_PER
lay NOM_PER
observer NOM_PER
has O
a O
sense O
of O
shock O
. O
The O
place O
resembles O
in O
almost O
equal O
proportions O
a O
cathedral O
, O
a O
suburban O
villa O
, O
a O
hotel O
and O
a O
Chinese O
pagoda O
. O
Many O
of O
its O
windows O
are O
of O
stained O
glass O
, O
and O
above O
the O
porch O
stand O
two O
terra-cotta O
lions O
, O
considerably O
more O
repulsive O
even O
than O
the O
complacent O
animals O
which O
guard O
New O
York O
's O
Public O
Library O
. O
It O
is O
a O
house O
which O
is O
impossible O
to O
overlook O
: O
and O
it O
was O
probably O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Pett PROP_PER
insisted O
on O
her NOM_PER
husband NOM_PER
buying O
it O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
liked O
to O
be O
noticed O
. O
Through O
the O
rich O
interior O
of O
this O
mansion O
Mr. O
Pett O
, O
its O
nominal O
proprietor O
, O
was O
wandering O
like O
a O
lost O
spirit O
. O
The O
hour O
was O
about O
ten O
of O
a O
fine O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
Sabbath O
calm O
which O
was O
upon O
the O
house O
had O
not O
communicated O
itself O
to O
him O
. O
There O
was O
a O
look O
of O
exasperation O
on O
his O
usually O
patient O
face O
, O
and O
a O
muttered O
oath O
, O
picked O
up O
no O
doubt O
on O
the O
godless O
Stock O
Exchange O
, O
escaped O
his O
lips O
. O
" O
Darn O
it O
! O
" O
He O
was O
afflicted O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
pathos O
of O
his O
position O
. O
It O
was O
not O
as O
if O
he O
demanded O
much O
from O
life O
. O
He O
asked O
but O
little O
here O
below O
. O
At O
that O
moment O
all O
that O
he O
wanted O
was O
a O
quiet O
spot O
where O
he O
might O
read O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
in O
solitary O
peace O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
find O
one O
. O
Intruders O
lurked O
behind O
every O
door O
. O
The O
place O
was O
congested O
. O
This O
sort O
of O
thing O
had O
been O
growing O
worse O
and O
worse O
ever O
since O
his O
marriage O
two O
years O
previously O
. O
There O
was O
a O
strong O
literary O
virus O
in O
Mrs. O
Pett O
's O
system O
. O
She O
not O
only O
wrote O
voluminously O
herself O
-- O
the O
name O
Nesta O
Ford O
Pett O
is O
familiar O
to O
all O
lovers O
of O
sensational O
fiction O
-- O
but O
aimed O
at O
maintaining O
a O
salon O
. O
Starting O
, O
in O
pursuance O
of O
this O
aim O
, O
with O
a O
single O
specimen O
, O
-- O
her O
nephew O
, O
Willie O
Partridge O
, O
who O
was O
working O
on O
a O
new O
explosive O
which O
would O
eventually O
revolutionise O
war O
-- O
she O
had O
gradually O
added O
to O
her O
collections O
, O
until O
now O
she O
gave O
shelter O
beneath O
her O
terra-cotta O
roof O
to O
no O
fewer O
than O
six O
young O
and O
unrecognised O
geniuses O
. O
Six O
brilliant O
youths O
, O
mostly O
novelists O
who O
had O
not O
yet O
started O
and O
poets O
who O
were O
about O
to O
begin O
, O
cluttered O
up O
Mr. O
Pett O
's O
rooms O
on O
this O
fair O
June O
morning O
, O
while O
he O
, O
clutching O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
, O
wandered O
about O
, O
finding O
, O
like O
the O
dove O
in O
Genesis O
, O
no O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
at O
such O
times O
that O
he O
was O
almost O
inclined O
to O
envy O
his O
wife O
's O
first O
husband O
, O
a O
business O
friend O
of O
his O
named O
Elmer O
Ford O
, O
who O
had O
perished O
suddenly O
of O
an O
apoplectic O
seizure O
: O
and O
the O
pity O
which O
he O
generally O
felt O
for O
the O
deceased O
tended O
to O
shift O
its O
focus O
. O
Marriage O
had O
certainly O
complicated O
life O
for O
Mr. O
Pett O
, O
as O
it O
frequently O
does O
for O
the O
man O
who O
waits O
fifty O
years O
before O
trying O
it O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
geniuses O
, O
Mrs. O
Pett O
had O
brought O
with O
her O
to O
her O
new O
home O
her O
only O
son O
, O
Ogden O
, O
a O
fourteen-year-old O
boy O
of O
a O
singularly O
unloveable O
type O
. O
Years O
of O
grown-up O
society O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
anything O
approaching O
discipline O
had O
given O
him O
a O
precocity O
on O
which O
the O
earnest O
efforts O
of O
a O
series O
of O
private O
tutors O
had O
expended O
themselves O
in O
vain O
. O
They O
came O
, O
full O
of O
optimism O
and O
self-confidence O
, O
to O
retire O
after O
a O
brief O
interval O
, O
shattered O
by O
the O
boy O
's O
stodgy O
resistance O
to O
education O
in O
any O
form O
or O
shape O
. O
To O
Mr. O
Pett O
, O
never O
at O
his O
ease O
with O
boys O
, O
Ogden O
Ford O
was O
a O
constant O
irritant O
. O
He O
disliked O
his O
stepson O
's O
personality O
, O
and O
he O
more O
than O
suspected O
him O
of O
stealing O
his O
cigarettes O
. O
It O
was O
an O
additional O
annoyance O
that O
he O
was O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
impossibility O
of O
ever O
catching O
him O
at O
it O
. O
Mr. O
Pett O
resumed O
his O
journey O
. O
He O
had O
interrupted O
it O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
listen O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
morning-room O
, O
but O
, O
a O
remark O
in O
a O
high O
tenor O
voice O
about O
the O
essential O
Christianity O
of O
the O
poet O
Shelley O
filtering O
through O
the O
oak O
, O
he O
had O
moved O
on O
. O
Silence O
from O
behind O
another O
door O
farther O
down O
the O
passage O
encouraged O
him O
to O
place O
his O
fingers O
on O
the O
handle O
, O
but O
a O
crashing O
chord O
from O
an O
unseen O
piano O
made O
him O
remove O
them O
swiftly O
. O
He O
roamed O
on O
, O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
the O
process O
of O
elimination O
had O
brought O
him O
to O
what O
was O
technically O
his O
own O
private O
library O
-- O
a O
large O
, O
soothing O
room O
full O
of O
old O
books O
, O
of O
which O
his O
father O
had O
been O
a O
great O
collector O
. O
Mr. O
Pett O
did O
not O
read O
old O
books O
himself O
, O
but O
he O
liked O
to O
be O
among O
them O
, O
and O
it O
is O
proof O
of O
his O
pessimism O
that O
he O
had O
not O
tried O
the O
library O
first O
. O
To O
his O
depressed O
mind O
it O
had O
seemed O
hardly O
possible O
that O
there O
could O
be O
nobody O
there O
. O
He O
stood O
outside O
the O
door O
, O
listening O
tensely O
. O
He O
could O
hear O
nothing O
. O
He O
went O
in O
, O
and O
for O
an O
instant O
experienced O
that O
ecstatic O
thrill O
which O
only O
comes O
to O
elderly O
gentlemen O
of O
solitary O
habit O
who O
in O
a O
house O
full O
of O
their O
juniors O
find O
themselves O
alone O
at O
last O
. O
Then O
a O
voice O
spoke O
, O
shattering O
his O
dream O
of O
solitude O
. O
" O
Hello O
, O
pop O
! O
" O
Ogden O
Ford O
was O
sprawling O
in O
a O
deep O
chair O
in O
the O
shadows O
. O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
pop O
, O
come O
in O
. O
Lots O
of O
room O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Pett O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway O
, O
regarding O
his O
step-son O
with O
a O
sombre O
eye O
. O
He O
resented O
the O
boy O
's O
tone O
of O
easy O
patronage O
, O
all O
the O
harder O
to O
endure O
with O
philosophic O
calm O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
latter O
was O
lounging O
in O
his O
favourite O
chair O
. O
Even O
from O
an O
aesthetic O
point O
of O
view O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
bulging O
child O
offended O
him O
. O
Ogden O
Ford O
was O
round O
and O
blobby O
and O
looked O
overfed O
. O
He O
had O
the O
plethoric O
habit O
of O
one O
to O
whom O
wholesome O
exercise O
is O
a O
stranger O
and O
the O
sallow O
complexion O
of O
the O
confirmed O
candy-fiend O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
a O
bare O
half O
hour O
after O
breakfast O
, O
his O
jaws O
were O
moving O
with O
a O
rhythmical O
, O
champing O
motion O
. O
" O
What O
are O
you O
eating O
, O
boy O
? O
" O
demanded O
Mr. O
Pett O
, O
his O
disappointment O
turning O
to O
irritability O
. O
" O
Candy O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
not O
eat O
candy O
all O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Mother O
gave O
it O
to O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Ogden O
simply O
. O
As O
he O
had O
anticipated O
, O
the O
shot O
silenced O
the O
enemy O
's O
battery O
. O
Mr. O
Pett O
grunted O
, O
but O
made O
no O
verbal O
comment O
. O
Ogden O
celebrated O
his O
victory O
by O
putting O
another O
piece O
of O
candy O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O
" O
Got O
a O
grouch O
this O
morning O
, O
have O
n't O
you O
, O
pop O
? O
" O
" O
I O
will O
not O
be O
spoken O
to O
like O
that O
! O
" O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
had O
, O
" O
said O
his O
step-son O
complacently O
. O
" O
I O
can O
always O
tell O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
you O
want O
to O
come O
picking O
on O
me O
, O
though O
. O
I O
've O
done O
nothing O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Pett O
was O
sniffing O
suspiciously O
. O
" O
You O
've O
been O
smoking O
. O
" O
" O
Me O
!! O
" O
" O
Smoking O
cigarettes O

sir O
! O
" O
" O
There O
are O
two O
butts O
in O
the O
ash-tray O

" O
" O
I O
did O
n't O
put O
them O
there O
. O
" O
" O
One O
of O
them O
is O
warm O

" O
" O
It O
's O
a O
warm O
day O
. O
" O
" O
You O
dropped O
it O
there O
when O
you O
heard O
me O
come O
in O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
sir O
! O
I O
've O
only O
been O
here O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O
I O
guess O
one O
of O
the O
fellows O
was O
in O
here O
before O
me O
. O
They O
're O
always O
swiping O
your O
coffin-nails O
. O
You O
ought O
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
, O
pop O
. O
You O
ought O
to O
assert O
yourself O
. O
" O
A O
sense O
of O
helplessness O
came O
upon O
Mr. O
Pett O
. O
For O
the O
thousandth O
time O
he O
felt O
himself O
baffled O
by O
this O
calm O
, O
goggle-eyed O
boy O
who O
treated O
him O
with O
such O
supercilious O
coolness O
. O
" O
You O
ought O
to O
be O
out O
in O
the O
open O
air O
this O
lovely O
morning O
, O
" O
he O
said O
feebly O
. O
" O
All O
right O

go O
for O
a O
walk O

you O
will O

" O
" O
I O
-- O
I O
have O
other O
things O
to O
do O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Pett O
, O
recoiling O
from O
the O
prospect O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
this O
fresh-air O
stuff O
is O
overrated O
anyway O
. O
Where O
's O
the O
sense O
of O
having O
a O
home O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
stop O
in O
it O
? O
" O
" O
When O
I O
was O
your O
age O

I O
would O
have O
been O
out O
on O
a O
morning O

" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
a O
martyr O

said O
Mr. O

who O
was O
touchy O
on O
the O
subject O

" O
Mr. O
Pett O
retired O
, O
fermenting O
. O
He O
wondered O
how O
another O
man O
would O
have O
handled O
this O
situation O
. O
The O
ridiculous O
inconsistency O
of O
the O
human O
character O
infuriated O
him O
. O
Why O
should O
he O
be O
a O
totally O
different O
man O
on O
Riverside O
Drive O
from O
the O
person O
he O
was O
in O
Pine O
Street O
? O
Why O
should O
he O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
own O
in O
Pine O
Street O
with O
grown O
men O
-- O
whiskered O
, O
square-jawed O
financiers O
-- O
and O
yet O
be O
unable O
on O
Riverside O
Drive O
to O
eject O
a O
fourteen-year-old O
boy O
from O
an O
easy O
chair O
? O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
sometimes O
that O
a O
curious O
paralysis O
of O
the O
will O
came O
over O
him O
out O
of O
business O
hours O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
he O
had O
still O
to O
find O
a O
place O
where O
he O
could O
read O
his O
Sunday O
paper O
. O
He O
stood O
for O
a O
while O
in O
thought O
. O
Then O
his O
brow O
cleared O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
mount O
the O
stairs O
. O
Reaching O
the O
top O
floor O
, O
he O
walked O
along O
the O
passage O
and O
knocked O
on O
a O
door O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
From O
behind O
this O
door O
, O
as O
from O
behind O
those O
below O
, O
sounds O
proceeded O
, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
discourage O
Mr. O
Pett O
. O
It O
was O
the O
tapping O
of O
a O
typewriter O
that O
he O
heard O
, O
and O
he O
listened O
to O
it O
with O
an O
air O
of O
benevolent O
approval O
. O
He O
loved O
to O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
typewriter O
: O
it O
made O
home O
so O
like O

" O
Come O

" O
called O
a O
girl O

. O
The O
room O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Pett O
found O
himself O
was O
small O
but O
cosy O
, O
and O
its O
cosiness O
-- O
oddly O
, O
considering O
the O
sex O
of O
its O
owner O
-- O
had O
that O
peculiar O
quality O
which O
belongs O
as O
a O
rule O
to O
the O
dens O
of O
men O

A O
large O

CHAPTER O
I O
When O
I PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
small NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
century O
I PRON_PER
remember O
an NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
wore NOM_PER
knee-breeches NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
worsted NOM_PER
stockings NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
used NOM_PER
to NOM_PER
hobble NOM_PER
about NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
street NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
our NOM_PER
village NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
help NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
stick NOM_PER
. O
He O
must O
have O
been O
getting O
on O
for O
eighty O
in O
the O
year O
1807 O
, O
earlier O
than O
which O
date O
I O
suppose O
I O
can O
hardly O
remember O
him O
, O
for O
I O
was O
born O
in O
1802 O
. O
A O
few O
white O
locks O
hung O
about O
his O
ears O
, O
his O
shoulders O
were O
bent O
and O
his O
knees O
feeble O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
hale O
, O
and O
was O
much O
respected O
in O
our O
little O
world O
of O
Paleham O
. O
His O
name O
was O
Pontifex O
. O
His O
wife O
was O
said O
to O
be O
his O
master O
; O
I O
have O
been O
told O
she O
brought O
him O
a O
little O
money O
, O
but O
it O
can O
not O
have O
been O
much O
. O
She O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
square-shouldered O
person O
( O
I O
have O
heard O
my O
father O
call O
her O
a O
Gothic O
woman O
) O
who O
had O
insisted O
on O
being O
married O
to O
Mr O
Pontifex O
when O
he O
was O
young O
and O
too O
good-natured O
to O
say O
nay O
to O
any O
woman O
who O
wooed O
him O
. O
The O
pair O
had O
lived O
not O
unhappily O
together O
, O
for O
Mr O
Pontifex O
's O
temper O
was O
easy O
and O
he O
soon O
learned O
to O
bow O
before O
his O
wife O
's O
more O
stormy O
moods O
. O
Mr O
Pontifex O
was O
a O
carpenter O
by O
trade O
; O
he O
was O
also O
at O
one O
time O
parish O
clerk O
; O
when O
I O
remember O
him O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
so O
far O
risen O
in O
life O
as O
to O
be O
no O
longer O
compelled O
to O
work O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
. O
In O
his O
earlier O
days O
he O
had O
taught O
himself O
to O
draw O
. O
I O
do O
not O
say O
he O
drew O
well O
, O
but O
it O
was O
surprising O
he O
should O
draw O
as O
well O
as O
he O
did O
. O
My O
father O
, O
who O
took O
the O
living O
of O
Paleham O
about O
the O
year O
1797 O
, O
became O
possessed O
of O
a O
good O
many O
of O
old O
Mr O
Pontifex O
's O
drawings O
, O
which O
were O
always O
of O
local O
subjects O
, O
and O
so O
unaffectedly O
painstaking O
that O
they O
might O
have O
passed O
for O
the O
work O
of O
some O
good O
early O
master O
. O
I O
remember O
them O
as O
hanging O
up O
framed O
and O
glazed O
in O
the O
study O
at O
the O
Rectory O
, O
and O
tinted O
, O
as O
all O
else O
in O
the O
room O
was O
tinted O
, O
with O
the O
green O
reflected O
from O
the O
fringe O
of O
ivy O
leaves O
that O
grew O
around O
the O
windows O
. O
I O
wonder O
how O
they O
will O
actually O
cease O
and O
come O
to O
an O
end O
as O
drawings O
, O
and O
into O
what O
new O
phases O
of O
being O
they O
will O
then O
enter O
. O
Not O
content O
with O
being O
an O
artist O
, O
Mr O
Pontifex O
must O
needs O
also O
be O
a O
musician O
. O
He O
built O
the O
organ O
in O
the O
church O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
, O
and O
made O
a O
smaller O
one O
which O
he O
kept O
in O
his O
own O
house O
. O
He O
could O
play O
as O
much O
as O
he O
could O
draw O
, O
not O
very O
well O
according O
to O
professional O
standards O
, O
but O
much O
better O
than O
could O
have O
been O
expected O
. O
I O
myself O
showed O
a O
taste O
for O
music O
at O
an O
early O
age O
, O
and O
old O
Mr O
Pontifex O
on O
finding O
it O
out O
, O
as O
he O
soon O
did O
, O
became O
partial O
to O
me O
in O
consequence O
. O
It O
may O
be O
thought O
that O
with O
so O
many O
irons O
in O
the O
fire O
he O
could O
hardly O
be O
a O
very O
thriving O
man O
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
. O
His O
father O
had O
been O
a O
day O
labourer O
, O
and O
he O
had O
himself O
begun O
life O
with O
no O
other O
capital O
than O
his O
good O
sense O
and O
good O
constitution O
; O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
was O
a O
goodly O
show O
of O
timber O
about O
his O
yard O
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
solid O
comfort O
over O
his O
whole O
establishment O
. O
Towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
eighteenth O
century O
and O
not O
long O
before O
my O
father O
came O
to O
Paleham O
, O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
farm O
of O
about O
ninety O
acres O
, O
thus O
making O
a O
considerable O
rise O
in O
life O
. O
Along O
with O
the O
farm O
there O
went O
an O
old-fashioned O
but O
comfortable O
house O
with O
a O
charming O
garden O
and O
an O
orchard O
. O
The O
carpenter O
's O
business O
was O
now O
carried O
on O
in O
one O
of O
the O
outhouses O
that O
had O
once O
been O
part O
of O
some O
conventual O
buildings O
, O
the O
remains O
of O
which O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
what O
was O
called O
the O
Abbey O
Close O
. O
The O
house O
itself O
, O
embosomed O
in O
honeysuckles O
and O
creeping O
roses O
, O
was O
an O
ornament O
to O
the O
whole O
village O
, O
nor O
were O
its O
internal O
arrangements O
less O
exemplary O
than O
its O
outside O
was O
ornamental O
. O
Report O
said O
that O
Mrs O
Pontifex O
starched O
the O
sheets O
for O
her O
best O
bed O
, O
and O
I O
can O
well O
believe O
it O
. O
How O
well O
do O
I O
remember O
her O
parlour O
half O
filled O
with O
the O
organ O
which O
her O
husband O
had O
built O
, O
and O
scented O
with O
a O
withered O
apple O
or O
two O
from O
the O
_ O
pyrus O
japonica O
_ O
that O
grew O
outside O
the O
house O
; O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
prize O
ox O
over O
the O
chimney-piece O
, O
which O
Mr O
Pontifex O
himself O
had O
painted O
; O
the O
transparency O
of O
the O
man O
coming O
to O
show O
light O
to O
a O
coach O
upon O
a O
snowy O
night O
, O
also O
by O
Mr O
Pontifex O
; O
the O
little O
old O
man O
and O
little O
old O
woman O
who O
told O
the O
weather O
; O
the O
china O
shepherd O
and O
shepherdess O
; O
the O
jars O
of O
feathery O
flowering O
grasses O
with O
a O
peacock O
's O
feather O
or O
two O
among O
them O
to O
set O
them O
off O
, O
and O
the O
china O
bowls O
full O
of O
dead O
rose O
leaves O
dried O
with O
bay O
salt O
. O
All O
has O
long O
since O
vanished O
and O
become O
a O
memory O
, O
faded O
but O
still O
fragrant O
to O
myself O
. O
Nay O
, O
but O
her O
kitchen O
-- O
and O
the O
glimpses O
into O
a O
cavernous O
cellar O
beyond O
it O
, O
wherefrom O
came O
gleams O
from O
the O
pale O
surfaces O
of O
milk O
cans O
, O
or O
it O
may O
be O
of O
the O
arms O
and O
face O
of O
a O
milkmaid O
skimming O
the O
cream O
; O
or O
again O
her O
storeroom O
, O
where O
among O
other O
treasures O
she O
kept O
the O
famous O
lipsalve O
which O
was O
one O
of O
her O
especial O
glories O
, O
and O
of O
which O
she O
would O
present O
a O
shape O
yearly O
to O
those O
whom O
she O
delighted O
to O
honour O
. O
She O
wrote O
out O
the O
recipe O
for O
this O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
mother O
a O
year O
or O
two O
before O
she O
died O
, O
but O
we O
could O
never O
make O
it O
as O
she O
did O
. O
When O
we O
were O
children O
she O
used O
sometimes O
to O
send O
her O
respects O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
and O
ask O
leave O
for O
us O
to O
come O
and O
take O
tea O
with O
her O
. O
Right O
well O
she O
used O
to O
ply O
us O
. O
As O
for O
her O
temper O
, O
we O
never O
met O
such O
a O
delightful O
old O
lady O
in O
our O
lives O
; O
whatever O
Mr O
Pontifex O
may O
have O
had O
to O
put O
up O
with O
, O
we O
had O
no O
cause O
for O
complaint O
, O
and O
then O
Mr O
Pontifex O
would O
play O
to O
us O
upon O
the O
organ O
, O
and O
we O
would O
stand O
round O
him O
open-mouthed O
and O
think O
him O
the O
most O
wonderfully O
clever O
man O
that O
ever O
was O
born O
, O
except O
of O
course O
our O
papa O
. O
Mrs O
Pontifex O
had O
no O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
at O
least O
I O
can O
call O
to O
mind O
no O
signs O
of O
this O
, O
but O
her O
husband O
had O
plenty O
of O
fun O
in O
him O
, O
though O
few O
would O
have O
guessed O
it O
from O
his O
appearance O
. O
I O
remember O
my O
father O
once O
sent O
me O
down O
to O
his O
workship O
to O
get O
some O
glue O
, O
and O
I O
happened O
to O
come O
when O
old O
Pontifex O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
scolding O
his O
boy O
. O
He O
had O
got O
the O
lad O
-- O
a O
pudding-headed O
fellow O
-- O
by O
the O
ear O
and O
was O
saying O
, O
" O
What O
? O
Lost O
again O
-- O
smothered O
o O
' O
wit O
. O
" O
( O
I O
believe O
it O
was O
the O
boy O
who O
was O
himself O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
wandering O
soul O
, O
and O
who O
was O
thus O
addressed O
as O
lost O
. O
) O
" O
Now O
, O
look O
here O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
some O
boys O
are O
born O
stupid O
, O
and O
thou O
art O
one O
of O
them O
; O
some O
achieve O
stupidity O
-- O
that O
's O
thee O
again O
, O
Jim O
-- O
thou O
wast O
both O
born O
stupid O
and O
hast O
greatly O
increased O
thy O
birthright O
-- O
and O
some O
" O
( O
and O
here O
came O
a O
climax O
during O
which O
the O
boy O
's O
head O
and O
ear O
were O
swayed O
from O
side O
to O
side O
) O
" O
have O
stupidity O
thrust O
upon O
them O
, O
which O
, O
if O
it O
please O
the O
Lord O
, O
shall O
not O
be O
thy O
case O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
for O
I O
will O
thrust O
stupidity O
from O
thee O
, O
though O
I O
have O
to O
box O
thine O
ears O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
" O
but O
I O
did O
not O
see O
that O
the O
old O
man O
really O
did O
box O
Jim O
's O
ears O
, O
or O
do O
more O
than O
pretend O
to O
frighten O
him O
, O
for O
the O
two O
understood O
one O
another O
perfectly O
well O
. O
Another O
time O
I O
remember O
hearing O
him O
call O
the O
village O
rat-catcher O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
Come O
hither O
, O
thou O
three-days-and-three-nights O
, O
thou O
, O
" O
alluding O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
learned O
, O
to O
the O
rat-catcher O
's O
periods O
of O
intoxication O
; O
but O
I O
will O
tell O
no O
more O
of O
such O
trifles O
. O
My O
father O
's O
face O
would O
always O
brighten O
when O
old O
Pontifex O
's O
name O
was O
mentioned O
. O
" O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Edward O
, O
" O
he O
would O
say O
to O
me O
, O
" O
old O
Pontifex O
was O
not O
only O
an O
able O
man O
, O
but O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
very O
ablest O
men O
that O
ever O
I O
knew O
. O
" O
This O
was O
more O
than O
I O
as O
a O
young O
man O
was O
prepared O
to O
stand O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
, O
" O
I O
answered O
, O
" O
what O
did O
he O
do O
? O
He O
could O
draw O
a O
little O
, O
but O
could O
he O
to O
save O
his O
life O
have O
got O
a O
picture O
into O
the O
Royal O
Academy O
exhibition O
? O
He O
built O
two O
organs O
and O
could O
play O
the O

of O

he O
was O

good O

why O

him O
out O

" O
" O
My O

" O
returned O
my O
father O
, O
" O
you O
must O
not O
judge O
by O
the O
work O
, O
but O
by O
the O
work O
in O
connection O
with O

Could O
Giotto O

Filippo O
Lippi O
, O
think O
you O
, O
have O
got O
a O
picture O

the O
Exhibition O

Would O
a O

one O
of O
those O
frescoes O
we O
went O
to O
see O
when O
we O
were O
at O

the O
remotest O
chance O
of O
being O
hung O
, O
if O
it O
were O
sent O
in O
for O
exhibition O
now O
? O
Why O
, O
the O
Academy O
people O
would O
be O
so O
outraged O
that O
they O
would O
not O
even O
write O
to O
poor O
Giotto O
to O
tell O
him O
to O
come O
and O
take O
his O
fresco O
away O
. O
Phew O
! O
" O
continued O
he O
, O
waxing O
warm O
, O
" O
if O
old O
Pontifex O
had O
had O
Cromwell O

chances O
he O
would O
have O
done O
all O
that O
Cromwell O
did O

done O
it O
better O

he O
would O
have O

all O
that O

it O
no O
worse O
; O
as O
it O
was O
, O
he O
was O
a O
village O

and O
I O
will O
undertake O
to O
say O
he O
never O
scamped O
a O
job O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
his O
life O

" O
" O

, O
" O

, O
" O
we O
can O
not O

I O
tell O
you O

Edward O

" O
said O
my O

with O
some O
severity O
, O
" O
we O
must O
judge O
men O
not O
so O
much O
by O
what O
they O

by O
what O

make O
us O

done O
enough O
either O
in O

the O
affairs O

to O
make O
me O
feel O
that O
I O
might O
trust O
him O
in O
an O
emergency O
he O
has O
done O
enough O

It O
is O
not O
by O
what O
a O
man O
has O
actually O
put O
upon O
his O
canvas O

by O
the O

down O

no O

I O
say O
again O

that O

At O

there O
is O

The O

One O
of O
the O
hotels O
at O
Vevey O
, O
however O
, O
is O
famous O
, O
even O
classical O
, O
being O
distinguished O
from O
many O
of O

by O
an O
air O
both O
of O

In O
this O

American NOM_PER

extremely O
numerous O
; O
it O
may O
be O
said O
, O
indeed O
, O
that O
Vevey O
assumes O
at O
this O
period O
some O
of O
the O
characteristics O
of O
an O
American O
watering O
place O
. O
There O
are O
sights O
and O
sounds O
which O
evoke O
a O
vision O

an O
echo O

of O

at O

I O
hardly O
know O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
analogies O
or O
the O
differences O
that O
were O
uppermost O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
a O
young O
American O
, O
who O
, O
two O
or O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
sat O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
the O
" O
Trois O
Couronnes O
, O
" O
looking O
about O
him O
, O
rather O
idly O
, O
at O
some O
of O
the O
graceful O
objects O
I O
have O
mentioned O
. O
It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
summer O
morning O
, O
and O
in O
whatever O
fashion O
the O
young O
American O
looked O
at O
things O
, O
they O
must O
have O
seemed O
to O
him O
charming O
. O
He O
had O
come O
from O
Geneva O
the O
day O
before O
by O
the O
little O
steamer O
, O
to O
see O
his O
aunt O
, O
who O
was O
staying O
at O
the O
hotel O
-- O
Geneva O
having O
been O
for O
a O
long O
time O
his O
place O
of O
residence O
. O
But O
his O
aunt O
had O
a O
headache O
-- O
his O
aunt O
had O
almost O
always O
a O
headache O
-- O
and O
now O
she O
was O
shut O
up O
in O
her O
room O
, O
smelling O
camphor O
, O
so O
that O
he O
was O
at O
liberty O
to O
wander O
about O
. O
He O
was O
some O
seven-and-twenty O
years O
of O
age O
; O
when O
his O
friends O
spoke O
of O
him O
, O
they O
usually O
said O
that O
he O
was O
at O
Geneva O
" O
studying O
. O
" O
When O
his O
enemies O
spoke O
of O
him O
, O
they O
said O
-- O
but O
, O
after O
all O
, O
he O
had O
no O
enemies O
; O
he O
was O
an O
extremely O
amiable O
fellow O
, O
and O
universally O
liked O
. O
What O
I O
should O
say O
is O
, O
simply O
, O
that O
when O
certain O
persons O
spoke O
of O
him O
they O
affirmed O
that O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
spending O
so O
much O
time O
at O
Geneva O
was O
that O
he O
was O
extremely O
devoted O
to O
a O
lady O
who O
lived O
there O
-- O
a O
foreign O
lady O
-- O
a O
person O
older O
than O
himself O
. O
Very O
few O
Americans O
-- O
indeed O
, O
I O
think O
none O
-- O
had O
ever O
seen O
this O
lady O
, O
about O
whom O
there O
were O
some O
singular O
stories O
. O
But O
Winterbourne O
had O
an O
old O
attachment O
for O
the O
little O
metropolis O
of O
Calvinism O
; O
he O
had O
been O
put O
to O
school O
there O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
and O
he O
had O
afterward O
gone O
to O
college O
there O
-- O
circumstances O
which O
had O
led O
to O
his O
forming O
a O
great O
many O
youthful O
friendships O
. O
Many O
of O
these O
he O
had O
kept O
, O
and O
they O
were O
a O
source O
of O
great O
satisfaction O
to O
him O
. O
After O
knocking O
at O
his O
aunt O
’s O
door O
and O
learning O
that O
she O
was O
indisposed O
, O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
walk O
about O
the O
town O
, O
and O
then O
he O
had O
come O
in O
to O
his O
breakfast O
. O
He O
had O
now O
finished O
his O
breakfast O
; O
but O
he O
was O
drinking O
a O
small O
cup O
of O
coffee O
, O
which O
had O
been O
served O
to O
him O
on O
a O
little O
table O
in O
the O
garden O
by O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
who O
looked O
like O
an O
attache O
. O
At O
last O
he O
finished O
his O
coffee O
and O
lit O
a O
cigarette O
. O
Presently O
a O
small O
boy O
came O
walking O
along O
the O
path O
-- O
an O
urchin O
of O
nine O
or O
ten O
. O
The O
child O
, O
who O
was O
diminutive O
for O
his O
years O
, O
had O
an O
aged O
expression O
of O
countenance O
, O
a O
pale O
complexion O
, O
and O
sharp O
little O
features O
. O
He O
was O
dressed O
in O
knickerbockers O
, O
with O
red O
stockings O
, O
which O
displayed O
his O
poor O
little O
spindle-shanks O
; O
he O
also O
wore O
a O
brilliant O
red O
cravat O
. O
He O
carried O
in O
his O
hand O
a O
long O
alpenstock O
, O
the O
sharp O
point O
of O
which O
he O
thrust O
into O
everything O
that O
he O
approached O
-- O
the O
flowerbeds O
, O
the O
garden O
benches O
, O
the O
trains O
of O
the O
ladies O
’ O
dresses O
. O
In O
front O
of O
Winterbourne O
he O
paused O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
bright O
, O
penetrating O
little O
eyes O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
a O
lump O
of O
sugar O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
in O
a O
sharp O
, O
hard O
little O
voice O
-- O
a O
voice O
immature O
and O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
not O
young O
. O
Winterbourne O
glanced O
at O
the O
small O
table O
near O
him O
, O
on O
which O
his O
coffee O
service O
rested O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
several O
morsels O
of O
sugar O
remained O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
you O
may O
take O
one O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
; O
" O
but O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
sugar O
is O
good O
for O
little O
boys O
. O
" O
This O
little O
boy O
stepped O
forward O
and O
carefully O
selected O
three O
of O
the O
coveted O
fragments O
, O
two O
of O
which O
he O
buried O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
knickerbockers O
, O
depositing O
the O
other O
as O
promptly O
in O
another O
place O
. O
He O
poked O
his O
alpenstock O
, O
lance-fashion O
, O
into O
Winterbourne O
’s O
bench O
and O
tried O
to O
crack O
the O
lump O
of O
sugar O
with O
his O
teeth O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
blazes O
; O
it O
’s O
har-r-d O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
pronouncing O
the O
adjective O
in O
a O
peculiar O
manner O
. O
Winterbourne O
had O
immediately O
perceived O
that O
he O
might O
have O
the O
honor O
of O
claiming O
him O
as O
a O
fellow O
countryman O
. O
" O
Take O
care O
you O
do O
n’t O
hurt O
your O
teeth O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
paternally O
. O
" O
I O
have O
n’t O
got O
any O
teeth O
to O
hurt O
. O
They O
have O
all O
come O
out O
. O
I O
have O
only O
got O
seven O
teeth O
. O
My O
mother O
counted O
them O
last O
night O
, O
and O
one O
came O
out O
right O
afterward O
. O
She O
said O
she O
’d O
slap O
me O
if O
any O
more O
came O
out O
. O
I O
ca O
n’t O
help O
it O
. O
It O
’s O
this O
old O
Europe O
. O
It O
’s O
the O
climate O
that O
makes O
them O
come O
out O
. O
In O
America O
they O
did O
n’t O
come O
out O
. O
It O
’s O
these O
hotels O
. O
" O
Winterbourne O
was O
much O
amused O
. O
" O
If O
you O
eat O
three O
lumps O
of O
sugar O
, O
your O
mother O
will O
certainly O
slap O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
She O
’s O
got O
to O
give O
me O
some O
candy O
, O
then O
, O
" O
rejoined O
his O
young O
interlocutor O
. O
" O
I O
ca O
n’t O
get O
any O
candy O
here O
-- O
any O
American O
candy O
. O
American O
candy O
’s O
the O
best O
candy O
. O
" O
" O
And O
are O
American O
little O
boys O
the O
best O
little O
boys O
? O
" O
asked O
Winterbourne O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O
I O
’m O
an O
American O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
the O
child O
. O
" O
I O
see O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
best O
! O
" O
laughed O
Winterbourne O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
an O
American O
man O
? O
" O
pursued O
this O
vivacious O
infant O
. O
And O
then O
, O
on O
Winterbourne O
’s O
affirmative O
reply O
-- O
" O
American O
men O
are O
the O
best O
, O
" O
he O
declared O
. O
His O
companion O
thanked O
him O
for O
the O
compliment O
, O
and O
the O
child O
, O
who O
had O
now O
got O
astride O
of O
his O
alpenstock O
, O
stood O
looking O
about O
him O
, O
while O
he O
attacked O
a O
second O
lump O
of O
sugar O
. O
Winterbourne O
wondered O
if O
he O
himself O
had O
been O
like O
this O
in O
his O
infancy O
, O
for O
he O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
Europe O
at O
about O
this O
age O
. O
" O
Here O
comes O
my O
sister O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
child O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
" O
She O
’s O
an O
American O
girl O
. O
" O
Winterbourne O
looked O
along O
the O
path O
and O
saw O
a O
beautiful O
young O
lady O
advancing O
. O
" O
American O
girls O
are O
the O
best O
girls O
, O
" O
he O
said O
cheerfully O
to O
his O
young O
companion O
. O
" O
My O
sister O

the O
best O

always O
blowing O
at O
me O

" O
" O
I O
imagine O
that O
is O
your O
fault O
, O
not O
hers O
, O
" O
said O
Winterbourne O
. O
The O
young O
lady O
meanwhile O
had O
drawn O
near O
. O
She O
was O
dressed O
in O
white O
muslin O
, O
with O
a O
hundred O
frills O
and O
flounces O
, O
and O
knots O
of O
pale-colored O
ribbon O
. O
She O
was O
bareheaded O
, O
but O
she O
balanced O
in O
her O
hand O
a O
large O
parasol O
, O
with O
a O
deep O
border O
of O
embroidery O
; O
and O
she O
was O
strikingly O
, O
admirably O
pretty O
. O
" O
How O
pretty O
they O
are O
! O
" O
thought O
Winterbourne O
, O
straightening O
himself O
in O
his O
seat O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
prepared O
to O
rise O
. O
The O
young O
lady O
paused O
in O
front O
of O
his O
bench O
, O
near O
the O
parapet O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
which O
overlooked O
the O
lake O
. O
The O
little O
boy O
had O
now O
converted O
his O
alpenstock O
into O
a O
vaulting O
pole O
, O
by O
the O
aid O
of O
which O
he O
was O
springing O
about O
in O
the O
gravel O
and O
kicking O
it O
up O
not O
a O
little O
. O
" O
Randolph O
, O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
" O
what O
ARE O
you O
doing O
? O
" O
" O
I O
’m O
going O
up O
the O
Alps O
, O
" O
replied O
Randolph O
. O
" O
This O
is O
the O
way O
! O
" O
And O
he O
gave O
another O
little O
jump O
, O
scattering O
the O
pebbles O
about O
Winterbourne O
’s O
ears O
. O
" O
That O
’s O
the O
way O
they O
come O
down O
, O
" O
said O
Winterbourne O
. O
" O
He O
’s O
an O
American O
man O
! O
" O
cried O
Randolph O
, O
in O
his O
little O
hard O
voice O
. O
The O
young O
lady O
gave O
no O
heed O
to O
this O
announcement O
, O
but O
looked O
straight O
at O
her O
brother O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
guess O
you O
had O
better O
be O
quiet O
, O
" O
she O
simply O
observed O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Winterbourne O
that O
he O
had O
been O
in O
a O
manner O
presented O
. O
He O
got O
up O
and O
stepped O
slowly O
toward O
the O
young O
girl O
, O
throwing O
away O
his O
cigarette O
. O
" O
This O
little O
boy O
and O
I O
have O
made O
acquaintance O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
with O
great O
civility O
. O
In O
Geneva O
, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
perfectly O
aware O
, O
a O
young O
man O
was O
not O
at O
liberty O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
young O
unmarried O
lady O
except O
under O
certain O
rarely O
occurring O
conditions O
; O
but O
here O
at O
Vevey O
, O
what O
conditions O
could O
be O
better O
than O
these O
? O
-- O
a O
pretty O
American O
girl O
coming O
and O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
you O
in O
a O
garden O
. O
This O
pretty O
American O
girl O
, O
however O
, O
on O
hearing O
Winterbourne O
’s O
observation O
, O
simply O
glanced O
at O
him O
; O
she O
then O
turned O
her O
head O
and O
looked O
over O
the O
parapet O
, O
at O
the O
lake O
and O
the O
opposite O
mountains O
. O
He O
wondered O
whether O
he O
had O
gone O
too O
far O
, O
but O
he O
decided O
that O
he O
must O
advance O
farther O
, O
rather O
than O
retreat O
. O
While O
he O
was O
thinking O
of O
something O
else O
to O
say O
, O
the O
young O
lady O
turned O
to O
the O
little O
boy O
again O
. O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
where O
you O
got O
that O
pole O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
" O
responded O
Randolph O
. O
" O
You O
do O

In O
nearly O
all O
the O
cities O
and O

of O
the O
Slave O
States O
, O
the O
real O
negro O
, O
or O
clear O
black O
, O
does O
not O
amount O
to O
more O
than O
one O
in O
four O
of O
the O
slave O
population O
. O
This O
fact O
is O
of O
itself O
the O
best O
evidence O
of O
the O
degraded O
and O
immoral O
condition O
of O
the O
relation O
of O
master O
and O
slave O
. O
Throughout O
the O
Southern O
States O
, O
there O
is O
a O
class O
of O
slaves O
who O
, O
in O
most O
of O
the O
towns O
, O
are O
permitted O
to O
hire O
their O
time O
from O
their O
owners O
, O
and O
who O
are O
always O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
high O
price O
. O
This O
class O
is O
the O
mulatto O
women O
, O
distinguished O
for O
their O
fascinating O
beauty O
. O
The O
handsomest O
of O
these O
usually O
pay O
the O
greatest O
amount O
for O
their O
time O
. O
Many O
of O
these O
women O
are O
the O
favorites O
of O
men O
of O
property O
and O
standing O
, O
who O
furnish O
them O
with O
the O
means O
of O
compensating O
their O
owners O
, O
and O
not O
a O
few O
are O
dressed O
in O
the O
most O
extravagant O
manner O
. O
When O
we O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
fact O
that O
no O
safeguard O
is O
thrown O
around O
virtue O
, O
and O
no O
inducement O
held O
out O
to O
slave-women O
to O
be O
pure O
and O
chaste O
, O
we O
will O
not O
be O
surprised O
when O
told O
that O
immorality O
and O
vice O
pervade O
the O
cities O
and O
towns O
of O
the O
South O
to O
an O
extent O
unknown O
in O
the O
Northern O
States O
. O
Indeed O
, O
many O
of O
the O
slave-women O
have O
no O
higher O
aspiration O
than O
that O
of O
becoming O
the O
finely-dressed O
mistress O
of O
some O
white O
man O
. O
At O
negro O
balls O
and O
parties O
, O
this O
class O
of O
women O
usually O
make O
the O
most O
splendid O
appearance O
, O
and O
are O
eagerly O
sought O
after O
in O
the O
dance O
, O
or O
to O
entertain O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
or O
at O
the O
table O
. O
A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
among O
the O
many O
slave-women O
in O
Richmond O
, O
Virginia O
, O
who O
hired O
their O
time O
of O
their O
masters O
, O
was O
Agnes O
, O
a O
mulatto O
owned O
by O
John O
Graves O
, O
Esq. O
, O
and O
who O
might O
be O
heard O
boasting O
that O
she O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
an O
American O
Senator O
. O
Although O
nearly O
forty O
years O
of O
age O
at O
the O
time O
of O
which O
we O
write O
, O
Agnes O
was O
still O
exceedingly O
handsome O
. O
More O
than O
half O
white O
, O
with O
long O
black O
hair O
and O
deep O
blue O
eyes O
, O
no O
one O
felt O
like O
disputing O
with O
her O
when O
she O
urged O
her O
claim O
to O
her O
relationship O
with O
the O
Anglo-Saxon O
. O
In O
her O
younger O
days O
, O
Agnes O
had O
been O
a O
housekeeper O
for O
a O
young O
slaveholder O
, O
and O
in O
sustaining O
this O
relation O
had O
become O
the O
mother O
of O
two O
daughters O
. O
After O
being O
cast O
aside O
by O
this O
young O
man O
, O
the O
slave-woman O
betook O
herself O
to O
the O
business O
of O
a O
laundress O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
most O
tasteful O
woman O
in O
Richmond O
at O
her O
vocation O
. O
Isabella O
and O
Marion O
, O
the O
two O
daughters O
of O
Agnes O
, O
resided O
with O
their O
mother O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
what O
aid O
they O
could O
in O
her O
business O
. O
The O
mother O
, O
however O
, O
was O
very O
choice O
of O
her O
daughters O
, O
and O
would O
allow O
them O
to O
perform O
no O
labor O
that O
would O
militate O
against O
their O
lady-like O
appearance O
. O
Agnes O
early O
resolved O
to O
bring O
up O
her O
daughters O
as O
ladies O
, O
as O
she O
termed O
it O
. O
As O
the O
girls O
grew O
older O
, O
the O
mother O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
stipulated O
price O
for O
them O
per O
month O
. O
Her O
notoriety O
as O
a O
laundress O
of O
the O
first O
class O
enabled O
her O
to O
put O
an O
extra O
charge O
upon O
the O
linen O
that O
passed O
through O
her O
hands O
; O
and O
although O
she O
imposed O
little O
or O
no O
work O
upon O
her O
daughters O
, O
she O
was O
enabled O
to O
live O
in O
comparative O
luxury O
and O
have O
her O
daughters O
dressed O
to O
attract O
attention O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
negro O
balls O
and O
parties O
. O
Although O
the O
term O
" O
negro O
ball O
" O
is O
applied O
to O
these O
gatherings O
, O
yet O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
the O
men O
who O
attend O
them O
are O
whites O

Negro O
balls O
and O
parties O
in O
the O
Southern O

in O
the O

quadroon O
women O
, O
a O
few O
negro O
men O
, O
and O
any O
number O
of O
white O

These O
are O

of O
the O
most O

character O

all O
take O

these O
social O
assemblies O
upon O
terms O
of O

equality O

The O
father O
and O
son O
not O
unfrequently O
meet O
and O
dance O
alike O
at O
a O
negro O
ball O
. O
It O
was O
at O
one O
of O
these O
parties O
that O
Henry O
Linwood O
, O
the O
son O
of O
a O
wealthy O
and O
retired O
gentleman O
of O
Richmond O
, O
was O
first O
introduced O
to O
Isabella O
, O
the O
oldest O
daughter O
of O
Agnes O
. O
The O
young O
man O
had O
just O
returned O
from O
Harvard O
College O
, O
where O
he O
had O
spent O
the O
previous O
five O
years O
. O
Isabella O
was O
in O
her O
eighteenth O
year O
, O
and O
was O
admitted O
by O
all O
who O
knew O
her O
to O
be O
the O
handsomest O
girl O
, O
colored O
or O
white O
, O
in O
the O
city O
. O
On O
this O
occasion O
, O
she O
was O
attired O
in O
a O
sky-blue O
silk O
dress O
, O
with O
deep O
black O
lace O
flounces O
, O
and O
bertha O
of O
the O
same O
. O
On O
her O
well-moulded O
arms O
she O
wore O
massive O
gold O
bracelets O
, O
while O
her O
rich O
black O
hair O
was O
arranged O
at O
the O
back O
in O
broad O
basket O
plaits O
, O
ornamented O
with O
pearls O
, O
and O
the O
front O
in O
the O
French O
style O
( O
a O
la O
Imperatrice O
) O
, O
which O
suited O
her O
classic O
face O
to O
perfection O
. O
Marion O
was O
scarcely O
less O
richly O
dressed O
than O
her O
sister O
. O
Henry O
Linwood O
paid O
great O
attention O
to O
Isabella O
which O
was O
looked O
upon O
with O
gratification O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
became O
a O
matter O
of O
general O
conversation O
with O
all O
present O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
young O
man O
escorted O
the O
beautiful O
quadroon O
home O
that O
evening O
, O
and O
became O
the O
favorite O
visitor O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Agnes O
. O
It O
was O
on O
a O
beautiful O
moonlight O
night O
in O
the O
month O
of O
August O
when O
all O
who O
reside O
in O
tropical O
climates O
are O
eagerly O
grasping O
for O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air O
, O
that O
Henry O
Linwood O
was O
in O
the O
garden O
which O
surrounded O
Agnes O
' O
cottage O
, O
with O
the O
young O
quadroon O
by O
his O
side O
. O
He O
drew O
from O
his O
pocket O
a O
newspaper O
wet O
from O
the O
press O
, O
and O
read O
the O
following O
advertisement O
: O
-- O
NOTICE O
. O
-- O
Seventy-nine O

will O
be O
offered O
for O
sale O

, O
being O
the O
entire O
stock O
of O
the O
late O
John O
Graves O
in O
an O
excellent O
condition O
, O
and O
all O
warranted O
against O
the O
common O
vices O
. O
Among O
them O
are O
several O
mechanics O
, O
able-bodied O
field-hands O
, O
plough-boys O
, O
and O
women O
with O
children O
, O
some O
of O
them O
very O
prolific O
, O
affording O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
for O
any O
one O
who O
wishes O
to O
raise O
a O
strong O
and O
healthy O
lot O
of O
servants O
for O
their O
own O
use O
. O
Also O
several O
mulatto O
girls O
of O
rare O
personal O
qualities O
, O
-- O
two O
of O
these O
very O
superior O
. O
Among O
the O
above O
slaves O
advertised O
for O
sale O
were O
Agnes O
and O
her O
two O
daughters O
. O
Ere O
young O
Linwood O
left O
the O
quadroon O
that O
evening O
, O
he O
promised O
her O
that O
he O
would O
become O
her O
purchaser O
, O
and O
make O
her O
free O
and O
her O
own O
mistress O
. O
Mr. O
Graves O
had O
long O
been O
considered O
not O
only O
an O
excellent O
and O
upright O
citizen O
of O
the O
first O
standing O
among O
the O
whites O
, O
but O
even O
the O
slaves O
regarded O
him O
as O
one O
of O
the O
kindest O
of O
masters O
. O
Having O
inherited O
his O
slaves O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
property O
, O
he O
became O
possessed O
of O
them O
without O
any O
consultation O
or O
wish O
of O
his O
own O
. O
He O
would O
neither O
buy O
nor O
sell O
slaves O
, O
and O
was O
exceedingly O
careful O
, O
in O
letting O
them O
out O
, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
find O
oppressive O
and O
tyrannical O
masters O
. O
No O
slave O
speculator O
ever O
dared O
to O
cross O
the O
threshold O
of O
this O
planter O
of O
the O
Old O
Dominion O
. O
He O
was O
a O
constant O
attendant O
upon O
religious O
worship O
, O
and O
was O
noted O
for O
his O
general O
benevolence O

Bible O
Society O
, O
the O
American O

cause O
of O
Foreign O

found O
in O
him O
a O
liberal O
friend O

was O
always O
anxious O
that O
his O

should O
appear O
well O

THE O
NEGRO O
SALE O
. O
As O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
, O
the O
day O
of O
sale O
brought O
an O
usually O
large O
number O
together O
to O
compete O
for O
the O
property O
to O
be O
sold O
. O
Farmers O
, O
who O
make O
a O
business O
of O
raising O
slaves O
for O
the O
market O
, O
were O
there O
, O
and O
slave-traders O
, O
who O
make O
a O
business O
of O
buying O
human O
beings O
in O
the O
slave-raising O
States O
and O
taking O
them O
to O
the O
far O
South O
, O
were O
also O
in O
attendance O
. O
Men O
and O
women O
, O
too O
, O
who O
wished O
to O
purchase O
for O
their O
own O
use O
, O
had O
found O
their O
way O
to O
the O
slave O
sale O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
throne O
was O
one O
who O
felt O
a O
deeper O
interest O
in O
the O
result O
of O
the O
sale O
than O
any O
other O
of O
the O
bystanders O
. O
This O
was O
young O
Linwood O
. O
True O
to O
his O
promise O
, O
he O
was O
there O
with O
a O
blank O
bank-check O
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
awaiting O
with O
impatience O
to O
enter O
the O
list O
as O
a O
bidder O
for O
the O
beautiful O
slave O
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
heart-rending O
scene O
to O
witness O
the O
lamentations O
of O
these O
slaves O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
had O
grown O
up O
together O
on O
the O
old O
homestead O
of O
Mr. O
Graves O
, O
and O
who O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
great O
kindness O
by O
that O
gentleman O
, O
during O
his O
life O
. O
Now O
they O
were O
to O
be O
separated O
, O
and O
form O
new O
relations O
and O
companions O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
precarious O
condition O
of O
the O
slave O
. O
Even O
when O
with O
a O
good O
master O
, O
there O
is O
no O
certainty O
of O
his O
happiness O
in O
the O
future O
. O
The O
less O
valuable O
slaves O
were O
first O
placed O
upon O
the O
auction-block O
, O
one O
after O
another O
, O
and O
sold O
to O
the O
highest O
bidder O
. O
Husbands O
and O
wives O
were O
separated O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
indifference O
that O
is O
unknown O
in O
any O
other O
relation O
in O
life O
. O
Brothers O
and O
sisters O
were O
tom O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
mothers O
saw O
their O
children O
for O
the O
last O
time O
on O
earth O
. O
It O
was O
late O
in O
the O
day O
, O
and O
when O
the O
greatest O
number O
of O
persons O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
present O
, O
when O
Agnes O
and O
her O
daughters O
were O
brought O
out O
to O
the O
place O
of O
sale O
. O
The O
mother O
was O
first O
put O
upon O
the O
auction-block O
, O
and O
sold O
to O
a O
noted O
negro O
trader O
named O
Jennings O
. O
Marion O
was O
next O
ordered O
to O
ascend O
the O
stand O
, O
which O
she O
did O
with O
a O
trembling O
step O
, O
and O
was O
sold O
for O
$ O
1200 O
. O
All O
eyes O
were O
now O
turned O
on O
Isabella O
, O
as O
she O
was O
led O
forward O
by O
the O
auctioneer O
. O
The O
appearance O
of O
the O
handsome O
quadroon O
caused O
a O
deep O
sensation O
among O
the O
crowd O
. O
There O
she O
stood O
, O
with O
a O
skin O
as O
fair O
as O
most O
white O
women O
, O
her O
features O
as O
beautifully O
regular O
as O
any O
of O
her O
sex O
of O
pure O
Anglo-Saxon O
blood O
, O
her O
long O
black O
hair O
done O
up O
in O
the O
neatest O
manner O
, O
her O
form O
tall O
and O
graceful O
, O
and O
her O
whole O
appearance O
indicating O
one O
superior O
to O
her O
condition O
. O
The O
auctioneer O
commenced O
by O
saying O
that O
Miss O
Isabella O
was O
fit O
to O
deck O
the O
drawing-room O
of O
the O
finest O
mansion O
in O
Virginia O

THE O
TURN O
OF O
THE O
SCREW O
The O
story O
had O
held O
us PRON_PER
, O
round O
the O
fire O
, O
sufficiently O
breathless O
, O
but O
except O
the O
obvious O
remark O
that O
it O
was O
gruesome O
, O
as O
, O
on O
Christmas O
Eve O
in O
an O
old O
house O
, O
a O
strange O
tale O
should O
essentially O
be O
, O
I PRON_PER
remember O
no O
comment O
uttered O
till O
somebody NOM_PER
happened O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
the O
only O
case O
he PRON_PER
had O
met O
in O
which O
such O
a O
visitation O
had O
fallen O
on O
a NOM_PER
child NOM_PER
. O
The O
case O
, O
I PRON_PER
may O
mention O
, O
was O
that O
of O
an O
apparition O
in O
just O
such O
an O
old O
house O
as O
had O
gathered O
us PRON_PER
for O
the O
occasion O
-- O
an O
appearance O
, O
of O
a O
dreadful O
kind O
, O
to O
a NOM_PER
little NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
sleeping NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
room NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
his NOM_PER
mother NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
waking NOM_PER
her NOM_PER
up NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
terror NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
it NOM_PER
; O
waking O
her O
not O
to O
dissipate O
his O
dread O
and O
soothe O
him O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
but O
to O
encounter O
also O
, O
herself O
, O
before O
she O
had O
succeeded O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
same O
sight O
that O
had O
shaken O
him O
. O
It O
was O
this O
observation O
that O
drew O
from O
Douglas O
-- O
not O
immediately O
, O
but O
later O
in O
the O
evening O
-- O
a O
reply O
that O
had O
the O
interesting O
consequence O
to O
which O
I O
call O
attention O
. O
Someone O
else O
told O
a O
story O
not O
particularly O
effective O
, O
which O
I O
saw O
he O
was O
not O
following O
. O
This O
I O
took O
for O
a O
sign O
that O
he O
had O
himself O
something O
to O
produce O
and O
that O
we O
should O
only O
have O
to O
wait O
. O
We O
waited O
in O
fact O
till O
two O
nights O
later O
; O
but O
that O
same O
evening O
, O
before O
we O
scattered O
, O
he O
brought O
out O
what O
was O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
" O
I O
quite O
agree O
-- O
in O
regard O
to O
Griffin O
’s O
ghost O
, O
or O
whatever O
it O
was O
-- O
that O
its O
appearing O
first O
to O
the O
little O
boy O
, O
at O
so O
tender O
an O
age O
, O
adds O
a O
particular O
touch O
. O
But O
it O
’s O
not O
the O
first O
occurrence O
of O
its O
charming O
kind O
that O
I O
know O
to O
have O
involved O
a O
child O
. O
If O
the O
child O
gives O
the O
effect O
another O
turn O
of O
the O
screw O
, O
what O
do O
you O
say O
to O
TWO O
children O
-- O
? O
" O
" O
We O
say O
, O
of O
course O
, O
" O
somebody O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
that O
they O
give O
two O
turns O
! O
Also O
that O
we O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
them O
. O
" O
I O
can O
see O
Douglas O
there O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
got O
up O
to O
present O
his O
back O
, O
looking O
down O
at O
his O
interlocutor O
with O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets O
. O
" O
Nobody O
but O
me O
, O
till O
now O
, O
has O
ever O
heard O
. O
It O
’s O
quite O
too O
horrible O
. O
" O
This O
, O
naturally O
, O
was O
declared O
by O
several O
voices O
to O
give O
the O
thing O
the O
utmost O
price O
, O
and O
our O
friend O
, O
with O
quiet O
art O
, O
prepared O
his O
triumph O
by O
turning O
his O
eyes O
over O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
and O
going O
on O
: O
" O
It O
’s O
beyond O
everything O
. O
Nothing O
at O
all O
that O
I O
know O
touches O
it O
. O
" O
" O
For O
sheer O
terror O
? O
" O
I O
remember O
asking O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
say O
it O
was O
not O
so O
simple O
as O
that O
; O
to O
be O
really O
at O
a O
loss O
how O
to O
qualify O
it O
. O
He O
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
made O
a O
little O
wincing O
grimace O
. O
" O
For O
dreadful O
-- O
dreadfulness O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
how O
delicious O
! O
" O
cried O
one O
of O
the O
women O
. O
He O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
her O
; O
he O
looked O
at O
me O
, O
but O
as O
if O
, O
instead O
of O
me O
, O
he O
saw O
what O
he O
spoke O
of O
. O
" O
For O
general O
uncanny O
ugliness O
and O
horror O
and O
pain O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
just O
sit O
right O
down O
and O
begin O
. O
" O
He O
turned O
round O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
gave O
a O
kick O
to O
a O
log O
, O
watched O
it O
an O
instant O
. O
Then O
as O
he O
faced O
us O
again O
: O
" O
I O
ca O
n’t O
begin O
. O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
send O
to O
town O
. O
" O
There O
was O
a O
unanimous O
groan O
at O
this O
, O
and O
much O
reproach O
; O
after O
which O
, O
in O
his O
preoccupied O
way O
, O
he O
explained O
. O
" O
The O
story O
’s O
written O
. O
It O
’s O
in O
a O
locked O
drawer O
-- O
it O
has O
not O
been O
out O
for O
years O
. O
I O
could O
write O
to O
my O
man O
and O
enclose O
the O
key O
; O
he O
could O
send O
down O
the O
packet O
as O
he O
finds O
it O
. O
" O
It O
was O
to O
me O
in O
particular O
that O
he O
appeared O
to O
propound O
this O
-- O
appeared O
almost O
to O
appeal O
for O
aid O
not O
to O
hesitate O
. O
He O
had O
broken O
a O
thickness O
of O
ice O
, O
the O
formation O
of O
many O
a O
winter O
; O
had O
had O
his O
reasons O
for O
a O
long O
silence O
. O
The O
others O
resented O
postponement O
, O
but O
it O
was O
just O
his O
scruples O
that O
charmed O
me O
. O
I O
adjured O
him O
to O
write O
by O
the O
first O
post O
and O
to O
agree O
with O
us O
for O
an O
early O
hearing O
; O
then O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
the O
experience O
in O
question O
had O
been O
his O
own O
. O
To O
this O
his O
answer O
was O
prompt O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
thank O
God O
, O
no O
! O
" O
" O
And O
is O
the O
record O
yours O
? O
You O
took O
the O
thing O
down O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
but O
the O
impression O
. O
I O
took O
that O
HERE O
" O
-- O
he O
tapped O
his O
heart O
. O
" O
I O
’ve O
never O
lost O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
your O
manuscript O
-- O
? O
" O
" O
Is O
in O
old O
, O
faded O
ink O
, O
and O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O
hand O
. O
" O
He O
hung O
fire O
again O
. O
" O
A O
woman O
’s O
. O
She O
has O
been O
dead O
these O
twenty O
years O
. O
She O
sent O
me O
the O
pages O
in O
question O
before O
she O
died O
. O
" O
They O
were O
all O
listening O
now O
, O
and O
of O
course O
there O
was O
somebody O
to O
be O
arch O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
to O
draw O
the O
inference O
. O
But O
if O
he O
put O
the O
inference O
by O
without O
a O
smile O
it O
was O
also O
without O
irritation O
. O
" O
She O
was O
a O
most O
charming O
person O
, O
but O
she O
was O
ten O
years O
older O
than O
I O
. O
She O
was O
my O
sister O
’s O
governess O
, O
" O
he O
quietly O
said O
. O
" O
She O
was O
the O
most O
agreeable O
woman O
I O
’ve O
ever O
known O
in O
her O
position O
; O
she O
would O
have O
been O
worthy O
of O
any O
whatever O
. O
It O
was O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
this O
episode O
was O
long O
before O
. O
I O
was O
at O
Trinity O
, O
and O
I O
found O
her O
at O
home O
on O
my O
coming O
down O
the O
second O
summer O
. O
I O
was O
much O
there O
that O
year O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
one O
; O
and O
we O
had O
, O
in O
her O
off-hours O
, O
some O
strolls O
and O
talks O
in O
the O
garden O
-- O
talks O
in O
which O
she O
struck O
me O
as O
awfully O
clever O
and O
nice O
. O
Oh O
yes O
; O
do O
n’t O
grin O
: O
I O
liked O
her O
extremely O
and O
am O
glad O
to O
this O
day O
to O
think O
she O
liked O
me O
, O
too O
. O
If O
she O
had O
n’t O
she O
would O
n’t O
have O
told O
me O
. O
She O
had O
never O
told O
anyone O
. O
It O
was O
n’t O
simply O
that O
she O
said O
so O
, O
but O
that O
I O
knew O
she O
had O
n’t O
. O
I O
was O
sure O
; O
I O
could O
see O
. O
You O
’ll O
easily O
judge O
why O
when O
you O
hear O
. O
" O
" O
Because O
the O
thing O
had O
been O
such O
a O
scare O
? O
" O
He O
continued O
to O
fix O
me O
. O
" O
You O
’ll O
easily O
judge O
, O
" O
he O
repeated O
: O
" O
YOU O
will O

" O
I O
fixed O
him O
, O
too O
. O
" O
I O
see O
. O
She O
was O
in O
love O
. O
" O
He O
laughed O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O
You O
ARE O
acute O
. O
Yes O
, O
she O
was O
in O
love O

That O
is O
, O
she O
had O
been O

That O
came O
out O

she O
could O
n’t O
tell O
her O
story O
without O
its O
coming O
out O

I O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
she O
saw O
I O
saw O
it O
; O
but O
neither O
of O
us O
spoke O
of O
it O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
time O
and O
the O
place O
-- O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
lawn O
, O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
great O
beeches O
and O
the O
long O
, O
hot O
summer O
afternoon O
. O
It O
was O
n’t O
a O
scene O
for O
a O
shudder O
; O
but O
oh O
-- O
! O
" O
He O
quitted O
the O
fire O
and O
dropped O
back O
into O
his O
chair O
. O
" O
You O
’ll O
receive O
the O
packet O

morning O

after O
dinner O

looked O

round O
again O

was O
almost O

quickly O

up O

he O
left O
us O
slightly O
bewildered O

From O
our O
end O
of O
the O
great O
brown O
hall O
we O
heard O
his O
step O
on O
the O
stair O
; O
whereupon O
Mrs. O
Griffin O
spoke O

" O
Well O

outbreak O

" O
I O
returned O

" O
will O
make O
a O
tremendous O
occasion O
of O
Thursday O
night O
; O
" O
and O
everyone O
so O
agreed O
with O
me O
that O
, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
it O
, O
we O
lost O
all O
attention O
for O
everything O

The O
last O
story O
, O
however O
incomplete O
and O
like O
the O
mere O
opening O
of O
a O
serial O
, O
had O
been O
told O
; O
we O
handshook O
and O
" O
candlestuck O
, O
" O
as O
somebody O
said O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
knew O
the O
next O
day O
that O
a O
letter O
containing O
the O
key O
had O
, O
by O
the O
first O
post O
, O
gone O
off O
to O
his O
London O
apartments O
; O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
just O
on O
account O
of O
-- O
the O
eventual O
diffusion O
of O
this O
knowledge O
we O
quite O
let O
him O
alone O
till O
after O
dinner O
, O
till O
such O
an O
hour O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
as O
might O
best O
accord O
with O
the O
kind O
of O
emotion O
on O
which O
our O
hopes O
were O
fixed O
. O
Then O
he O
became O
as O
communicative O
as O
we O
could O
desire O
and O
indeed O
gave O
us O
his O
best O
reason O
for O
being O
so O
. O
We O
had O
it O
from O
him O
again O
before O
the O
fire O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
as O
we O
had O
had O
our O
mild O
wonders O
of O
the O
previous O
night O
. O
It O
appeared O
that O
the O
narrative O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
read O
us O
really O
required O
for O
a O
proper O
intelligence O
a O
few O
words O
of O
prologue O
. O
Let O
me O
say O
here O
distinctly O
, O
to O
have O
done O
with O
it O
, O
that O
this O
narrative O
, O
from O
an O
exact O
transcript O
of O
my O
own O
made O
much O
later O

what O

Poor O
Douglas O

before O
his O
death O
-- O
when O
it O
was O
in O
sight O

committed O
to O
me O
the O
manuscript O
that O
reached O
him O
on O
the O
third O
of O
these O
days O
and O
that O
, O
on O
the O
same O
spot O
, O
with O
immense O
effect O

began O
to O

little O
circle O

the O
night O

the O

up O

that O

made O

more O

Buck PROP_PER
lived O
at O
a O
big O
house O
in O
the O
sun-kissed O
Santa O
Clara O
Valley O
. O
Judge PROP_PER
Miller PROP_PER
's O
place O
, O
it O
was O
called O
. O
It O
stood O
back O
from O
the O
road O
, O
half O
hidden O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
through O
which O
glimpses O
could O
be O
caught O
of O
the O
wide O
cool O
veranda O
that O
ran O
around O
its O
four O
sides O
. O
The O
house O
was O
approached O
by O
gravelled O
driveways O
which O
wound O
about O
through O
wide-spreading O
lawns O
and O
under O
the O
interlacing O
boughs O
of O
tall O
poplars O
. O
At O
the O
rear O
things O
were O
on O
even O
a O
more O
spacious O
scale O
than O
at O
the O
front O
. O
There O
were O
great O
stables O
, O
where O
a NOM_PER

held O
forth O

there O
was O

the O

took O
their O
morning O

afternoon O

And O
over O
this O
great O
demesne O
Buck O
ruled O
. O
Here O
he O
was O
born O
, O
and O
here O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
four O
years O
of O
his O
life O
. O
It O
was O
true O
, O
there O
were O
other O
dogs O
, O
There O
could O
not O
but O
be O
other O
dogs O
on O
so O
vast O
a O
place O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
count O
. O
They O
came O
and O
went O
, O
resided O
in O
the O
populous O
kennels O
, O
or O
lived O
obscurely O
in O
the O
recesses O
of O
the O
house O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
Toots O
, O
the O
Japanese O
pug O
, O
or O
Ysabel O
, O
the O
Mexican O
hairless O
, O
-- O
strange O
creatures O
that O
rarely O
put O
nose O
out O
of O
doors O
or O
set O
foot O
to O
ground O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
were O
the O
fox O
terriers O
, O
a O
score O
of O
them O
at O
least O
, O
who O
yelped O
fearful O
promises O
at O
Toots O
and O
Ysabel O
looking O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
at O
them O
and O
protected O
by O
a O
legion O
of O
housemaids O
armed O
with O
brooms O
and O
mops O
. O
But O
Buck O
was O
neither O
house-dog O
nor O
kennel-dog O
. O
The O
whole O
realm O
was O
his O
. O
He O
plunged O
into O
the O
swimming O
tank O
or O
went O
hunting O
with O
the O
Judge O
's O
sons O
; O
he O
escorted O
Mollie O
and O
Alice O
, O
the O
Judge O
's O
daughters O
, O
on O
long O
twilight O
or O
early O
morning O
rambles O
; O
on O
wintry O
nights O
he O
lay O
at O
the O
Judge O
's O
feet O
before O
the O
roaring O
library O
fire O
; O
he O
carried O
the O
Judge O
's O
grandsons O
on O
his O
back O
, O
or O
rolled O
them O
in O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
guarded O
their O
footsteps O
through O
wild O
adventures O
down O
to O
the O
fountain O
in O
the O
stable O
yard O
, O
and O
even O
beyond O
, O
where O
the O
paddocks O
were O
, O
and O
the O
berry O
patches O
. O
Among O
the O
terriers O
he O
stalked O
imperiously O
, O
and O
Toots O
and O
Ysabel O
he O
utterly O
ignored O
, O
for O
he O
was O
king O
, O
-- O
king O
over O
all O
creeping O
, O
crawling O
, O
flying O
things O
of O
Judge O
Miller O
's O
place O
, O
humans O
included O
. O
His O
father O
, O
Elmo O
, O
a O
huge O
St. O
Bernard O
, O
had O
been O
the O
Judge O
's O
inseparable O
companion O
, O
and O
Buck O
bid O
fair O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
way O
of O
his O
father O
. O
He O
was O
not O
so O
large O
, O
-- O
he O
weighed O
only O
one O
hundred O
and O
forty O
pounds O
, O
-- O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
Shep O
, O
had O
been O
a O
Scotch O
shepherd O
dog O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
one O
hundred O
and O
forty O
pounds O
, O
to O
which O
was O
added O
the O
dignity O
that O
comes O
of O
good O
living O
and O
universal O
respect O
, O
enabled O
him O
to O
carry O
himself O
in O
right O
royal O
fashion O
. O
During O
the O
four O
years O
since O
his O
puppyhood O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
life O
of O
a O
sated O
aristocrat O
; O
he O
had O
a O
fine O
pride O
in O
himself O
, O
was O
even O
a O
trifle O
egotistical O
, O
as O
country O
gentlemen O
sometimes O
become O
because O
of O
their O
insular O
situation O
. O
But O
he O
had O
saved O
himself O
by O
not O
becoming O
a O
mere O
pampered O
house-dog O
. O
Hunting O
and O
kindred O
outdoor O
delights O
had O
kept O
down O
the O
fat O
and O
hardened O
his O
muscles O
; O
and O
to O
him O
, O
as O
to O
the O
cold-tubbing O
races O
, O
the O
love O
of O
water O
had O
been O
a O
tonic O
and O
a O
health O
preserver O
. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
manner O
of O
dog O
Buck O
was O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1897 O
, O
when O
the O
Klondike O
strike O
dragged O
men O
from O
all O
the O
world O
into O
the O
frozen O
North O
. O
But O
Buck O
did O
not O
read O
the O
newspapers O
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Manuel O
, O
one O
of O
the O
gardener O
's O
helpers O
, O
was O
an O
undesirable O
acquaintance O
. O
Manuel O
had O
one O
besetting O
sin O
. O
He O
loved O
to O
play O
Chinese O
lottery O
. O
Also O
, O
in O
his O
gambling O
, O
he O
had O
one O
besetting O
weakness O
-- O
faith O
in O
a O
system O
; O
and O
this O
made O
his O
damnation O
certain O
. O
For O
to O
play O
a O
system O
requires O
money O
, O
while O
the O
wages O
of O
a O
gardener O
's O
helper O
do O
not O
lap O
over O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
wife O
and O
numerous O
progeny O
. O
The O
Judge O
was O
at O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
Raisin O
Growers O
' O
Association O
, O
and O
the O
boys O
were O
busy O
organizing O
an O
athletic O
club O
, O
on O
the O
memorable O
night O
of O
Manuel O
's O
treachery O
. O
No O
one O
saw O
him O
and O
Buck O
go O
off O
through O
the O
orchard O
on O
what O
Buck O
imagined O
was O
merely O
a O
stroll O
. O
And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
solitary O
man O
, O
no O
one O
saw O
them O
arrive O
at O
the O
little O
flag O
station O
known O
as O
College O
Park O
. O
This O
man O
talked O
with O
Manuel O
, O
and O
money O
chinked O
between O
them O
. O
" O
You O
might O
wrap O
up O
the O
goods O
before O
you O
deliver O
'm O
, O
" O
the O
stranger O
said O
gruffly O
, O
and O
Manuel O
doubled O
a O
piece O
of O
stout O
rope O
around O
Buck O
's O
neck O
under O
the O
collar O
. O
" O
Twist O
it O
, O
an O
' O
you O
'll O
choke O
'm O
plentee O
, O
" O
said O
Manuel O
, O
and O
the O
stranger O
grunted O
a O
ready O
affirmative O
. O
Buck O
had O
accepted O
the O
rope O
with O
quiet O
dignity O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
was O
an O
unwonted O
performance O
: O
but O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
trust O
in O
men O
he O
knew O
, O
and O
to O
give O
them O
credit O
for O
a O
wisdom O
that O
outreached O
his O
own O
. O
But O
when O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
rope O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
stranger O
's O
hands O
, O
he O
growled O
menacingly O
. O
He O
had O
merely O
intimated O
his O
displeasure O
, O
in O
his O
pride O
believing O
that O
to O
intimate O
was O
to O
command O
. O
But O
to O
his O
surprise O
the O
rope O
tightened O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
shutting O
off O
his O
breath O
. O
In O
quick O
rage O
he O
sprang O
at O
the O
man O
, O
who O
met O
him O
halfway O
, O
grappled O
him O
close O
by O
the O
throat O
, O
and O
with O
a O
deft O
twist O
threw O
him O
over O
on O
his O
back O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
tightened O
mercilessly O
, O
while O
Buck O
struggled O
in O
a O
fury O
, O
his O
tongue O
lolling O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
his O
great O
chest O
panting O
futilely O
. O
Never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
vilely O
treated O
, O
and O
never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
angry O
. O
But O
his O
strength O
ebbed O
, O
his O
eyes O
glazed O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
nothing O
when O
the O
train O
was O
flagged O
and O
the O
two O
men O
threw O
him O
into O
the O
baggage O
car O
. O
The O
next O
he O
knew O
, O
he O
was O
dimly O
aware O
that O
his O
tongue O
was O
hurting O
and O
that O
he O
was O
being O
jolted O
along O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
a O
conveyance O
. O
The O
hoarse O
shriek O
of O
a O
locomotive O
whistling O
a O
crossing O
told O
him O
where O
he O
was O
. O
He O
had O
travelled O
too O
often O
with O
the O
Judge O
not O
to O
know O
the O
sensation O
of O
riding O
in O
a O
baggage O
car O
. O
He O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
into O
them O
came O
the O
unbridled O
anger O
of O
a O
kidnapped O
king O
. O
The O
man O
sprang O
for O
his O
throat O
, O
but O
Buck O
was O
too O
quick O
for O
him O
. O
His O
jaws O
closed O
on O
the O
hand O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
relax O
till O
his O
senses O
were O
choked O
out O
of O
him O
once O
more O
. O
" O
Yep O
, O
has O
fits O
, O
" O
the O
man O
said O
, O
hiding O
his O
mangled O
hand O
from O
the O
baggageman O
, O
who O
had O
been O
attracted O
by O
the O
sounds O
of O
struggle O

" O
Concerning O
that O
night O

the O

spoke O

in O
a O
little O

of O
a O

on O
the O
San O
Francisco O
water O
front O
. O
" O
All O
I O
get O
is O
fifty O
for O
it O
, O
" O
he O
grumbled O
; O
" O
an O
' O
I O
would O
n't O
do O
it O
over O
for O
a O
thousand O
, O
cold O
cash O
. O
" O
His O
hand O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
bloody O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
the O
right O
trouser O
leg O
was O
ripped O
from O
knee O
to O
ankle O
. O
" O
How O
much O
did O
the O
other O
mug O
get O
? O
" O
the O
saloon-keeper O
demanded O
. O
" O
A O
hundred O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
Would O
n't O
take O
a O
sou O
less O
, O
so O
help O
me O
. O
" O
" O
That O
makes O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
, O
" O
the O
saloon-keeper O
calculated O
; O
" O
and O
he O
's O
worth O
it O
, O
or O
I O
'm O
a O
squarehead O
. O
" O
The O
kidnapper O
undid O
the O
bloody O
wrappings O
and O
looked O
at O
his O
lacerated O
hand O
. O
" O
If O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
hydrophoby O
-- O
" O
" O
It O
'll O
be O
because O
you O
was O
born O
to O
hang O
, O
" O
laughed O
the O
saloon-keeper O
. O
" O
Here O
, O
lend O
me O
a O
hand O
before O
you O
pull O
your O
freight O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O
Dazed O
, O
suffering O
intolerable O
pain O
from O
throat O
and O
tongue O
, O
with O
the O
life O
half O
throttled O
out O
of O
him O
, O
Buck O
attempted O
to O
face O
his O
tormentors O
. O
But O
he O
was O
thrown O
down O
and O
choked O
repeatedly O
, O
till O
they O
succeeded O
in O
filing O
the O
heavy O
brass O
collar O
from O
off O
his O
neck O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
was O
removed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
flung O
into O
a O
cagelike O
crate O
. O
There O
he O
lay O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
weary O
night O
, O
nursing O
his O
wrath O
and O
wounded O
pride O
. O
He O
could O
not O
understand O
what O
it O
all O
meant O
. O
What O
did O
they O
want O
with O
him O
, O
these O
strange O
men O
? O
Why O
were O
they O
keeping O
him O
pent O
up O
in O
this O
narrow O
crate O
? O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
oppressed O
by O
the O
vague O
sense O
of O
impending O
calamity O
. O
Several O
times O
during O
the O
night O
he O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
when O
the O
shed O
door O
rattled O
open O
, O
expecting O
to O
see O
the O
Judge O
, O
or O
the O
boys O
at O
least O
. O
But O
each O
time O
it O
was O
the O
bulging O
face O
of O
the O
saloon-keeper O
that O
peered O
in O
at O
him O
by O
the O
sickly O
light O
of O
a O
tallow O
candle O
. O
And O
each O
time O
the O
joyful O
bark O
that O
trembled O
in O
Buck O
's O
throat O
was O
twisted O
into O
a O
savage O
growl O
. O
But O
the O
saloon-keeper O
let O
him O
alone O
, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
four O
men O
entered O
and O
picked O
up O
the O
crate O
. O
More O
tormentors O
, O
Buck O
decided O
, O
for O
they O
were O
evil-looking O
creatures O
, O
ragged O
and O
unkempt O
; O
and O
he O
stormed O
and O
raged O
at O
them O
through O
the O
bars O
. O
They O
only O
laughed O
and O
poked O
sticks O
at O
him O
, O
which O
he O
promptly O
assailed O
with O
his O
teeth O
till O
he O
realized O
that O
that O
was O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O
Whereupon O
he O
lay O
down O
sullenly O
and O
allowed O
the O
crate O
to O
be O
lifted O
into O
a O
wagon O
. O
Then O
he O
, O
and O
the O
crate O
in O
which O
he O
was O
imprisoned O
, O
began O
a O
passage O
through O
many O
hands O
. O
Clerks O
in O
the O
express O
office O
took O
charge O
of O
him O
; O
he O
was O
carted O
about O
in O
another O
wagon O
; O
a O
truck O
carried O
him O
, O
with O
an O
assortment O
of O
boxes O
and O
parcels O
, O
upon O
a O
ferry O
steamer O
; O
he O
was O
trucked O
off O
the O
steamer O
into O
a O
great O
railway O
depot O
, O
and O
finally O
he O
was O
deposited O
in O
an O
express O
car O

CHAPTER O
I O
I PRON_PER
MEET O
SIR PROP_PER
HENRY PROP_PER
CURTIS PROP_PER
It O
is O
a O
curious O
thing O
that O
at O
my PRON_PER
age O
-- O
fifty-five O
last O
birthday O
-- O
I PRON_PER
should O
find O
myself PRON_PER
taking O
up O
a O
pen O
to O
try O
to O
write O
a O
history O
. O
I PRON_PER
wonder O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
history O
it O
will O
be O
when O
I PRON_PER
have O
finished O
it O
, O
if O
ever O
I PRON_PER
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
trip O
! O
I PRON_PER
have O
done O
a O
good O
many O
things O
in O
my PRON_PER
life O
, O
which O
seems O
a O
long O
one O
to O
me PRON_PER
, O
owing O
to O
my PRON_PER
having O
begun O
work O
so O
young O
, O
perhaps O
. O
At O
an O
age O
when O
other NOM_PER
boys NOM_PER
are O
at O
school O
I PRON_PER
was O
earning O
my PRON_PER
living O
as O
a NOM_PER
trader NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
Colony NOM_PER
. O
I PRON_PER
have O
been O
trading O
, O
hunting O
, O
fighting O
, O
or O
mining O
ever O
since O
. O
And O
yet O
it O
is O
only O
eight O
months O
ago O
that O
I PRON_PER
made O
my PRON_PER
pile O
. O
It O
is O
a O
big O
pile O
now O
that O
I PRON_PER
have O
got O
it O
-- O
I PRON_PER
do O
n't O
yet O
know O
how O
big O
-- O
but O
I PRON_PER
do O
not O
think O
I PRON_PER
would O
go O
through O
the O
last O
fifteen O
or O
sixteen O
months O
again O
for O
it O
; O
no O
, O
not O
if O
I PRON_PER
knew O
that O
I PRON_PER
should O
come O
out O
safe O
at O
the O
end O
, O
pile O
and O
all O
. O
But O
then O
I PRON_PER
am O
a NOM_PER
timid NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
, O
and O
dislike O
violence O
; O
moreover O
, O
I PRON_PER
am O
almost O
sick O
of O
adventure O
. O
I PRON_PER
wonder O
why O
I PRON_PER
am O
going O
to O
write O
this O
book O
: O
it O
is O
not O
in O
my PRON_PER
line O
. O
I PRON_PER
am O
not O
a NOM_PER
literary NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
, O
though O
very O
devoted O
to O
the O
Old O
Testament O
and O
also O
to O
the O
" O
Ingoldsby O
Legends O
. O
" O
Let O
me PRON_PER
try O
to O
set O
down O
my PRON_PER
reasons O
, O
just O
to O
see O
if O
I PRON_PER
have O
any O
. O
First O
reason O
: O
Because O
Sir PROP_PER
Henry PROP_PER
Curtis PROP_PER
and O
Captain PROP_PER
John PROP_PER
Good PROP_PER
asked O
me PRON_PER
. O
Second O
reason O
: O
Because O
I PRON_PER
am O
laid O
up O
here O
at O
Durban O
with O
the O
pain O
in O
my PRON_PER
left O
leg O
. O
Ever O
since O
that O
confounded O
lion O
got O
hold O
of O
me PRON_PER
I PRON_PER
have O
been O
liable O
to O
this O
trouble O
, O
and O
being O
rather O
bad O
just O
now O
, O
it O
makes O
me PRON_PER
limp O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
There O
must O
be O
some O
poison O
in O
a O
lion O
's O
teeth O
, O
otherwise O
how O
is O
it O
that O
when O
your PRON_PER
wounds O
are O
healed O
they O
break O
out O
again O
, O
generally O
, O
mark O
you PRON_PER
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
of O
year O
that O
you PRON_PER
got O
your PRON_PER
mauling O
? O
It O
is O
a O
hard O
thing O
when O
one O
has O
shot O
sixty-five O
lions O
or O
more O
, O
as O
I PRON_PER
have O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my PRON_PER
life O
, O
that O
the O
sixty-sixth O
should O
chew O
your PRON_PER
leg O
like O
a O
quid O
of O
tobacco O
. O
It O
breaks O
the O
routine O
of O
the O
thing O
, O
and O
putting O
other O
considerations O
aside O
, O
I PRON_PER
am O
an NOM_PER
orderly NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
and O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
. O
This O
is O
by O
the O
way O
. O
Third O
reason O
: O
Because O
I PRON_PER
want O
my NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
Harry O
, O
who O
is O
over O
there O
at O
the O
hospital O
in O
London O
studying O
to O
become O
a O
doctor O
, O
to O
have O
something O
to O
amuse O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
out O
of O
mischief O
for O
a O
week O
or O
so O
. O
Hospital O
work O
must O
sometimes O
pall O
and O
grow O
rather O
dull O
, O
for O
even O
of O
cutting O
up O
dead O
bodies O
there O
may O
come O
satiety O
, O
and O
as O
this O
history O
will O
not O
be O
dull O
, O
whatever O
else O
it O
may O
be O
, O
it O
will O
put O
a O
little O
life O
into O
things O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
while O
Harry O
is O
reading O
of O
our O
adventures O
. O
Fourth O
reason O
and O
last O
: O
Because O
I O
am O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
strangest O
story O
that O
I O
remember O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
a O
queer O
thing O
to O
say O
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
there O
is O
no O
woman O
in O
it O
-- O
except O
Foulata O
. O
Stop O
, O
though O
! O
there O
is O
Gagaoola O
, O
if O
she O
was O
a O
woman O
, O
and O
not O
a O
fiend O
. O
But O
she O
was O
a O
hundred O
at O
least O
, O
and O
therefore O
not O
marriageable O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
count O
her O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
there O
is O
not O
a O
_ O
petticoat O
_ O
in O
the O
whole O
history O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
had O
better O
come O
to O
the O
yoke O
. O
It O
is O
a O
stiff O
place O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
were O
bogged O
up O
to O
the O
axle O
. O
But O
, O
" O
_ O
sutjes O
, O
sutjes O
_ O
, O
" O
as O
the O
Boers O
say O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
they O
spell O
it O
-- O
softly O
does O
it O
. O
A O
strong O
team O
will O
come O
through O
at O
last O
, O
that O
is O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
poor O
. O
You O
can O
never O
do O
anything O
with O
poor O
oxen O
. O
Now O
to O
make O
a O
start O
. O
I O
, O
Allan O
Quatermain O
, O
of O
Durban O
, O
Natal O
, O
Gentleman O
, O
make O
oath O
and O
say O
-- O
That O
's O
how O
I O
headed O
my O
deposition O
before O
the O
magistrate O
about O
poor O
Khiva O
's O
and O
Ventvögel O
's O
sad O
deaths O
; O
but O
somehow O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
quite O
the O
right O
way O
to O
begin O
a O
book O
. O
And O
, O
besides O
, O
am O
I O
a O
gentleman O
? O
What O
is O
a O
gentleman O
? O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
know O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
have O
had O
to O
do O
with O
niggers O
-- O
no O
, O
I O
will O
scratch O
out O
that O
word O
" O
niggers O
, O
" O
for O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O
I O
've O
known O
natives O
who O
_ O
are O
_ O
, O
and O
so O
you O
will O
say O
, O
Harry O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
before O
you O
have O
done O
with O
this O
tale O
, O
and O
I O
have O
known O
mean O
whites O
with O
lots O
of O
money O
and O
fresh O
out O
from O
home O
, O
too O
, O
who O
_ O
are O
not O
_ O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
I O
was O
born O
a O
gentleman O
, O
though O
I O
have O
been O
nothing O
but O
a O
poor O
travelling O
trader O
and O
hunter O
all O
my O
life O
. O
Whether O
I O
have O
remained O
so O
I O
known O
not O
, O
you O
must O
judge O
of O
that O
. O
Heaven O
knows O
I O
've O
tried O
. O
I O
have O
killed O
many O
men O
in O
my O
time O
, O
yet O
I O
have O
never O
slain O
wantonly O
or O
stained O
my O
hand O
in O
innocent O
blood O
, O
but O
only O
in O
self-defence O
. O
The O
Almighty O
gave O
us O
our O
lives O
, O
and O
I O
suppose O
He O
meant O
us O
to O
defend O
them O
, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
always O
acted O
on O
that O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
not O
be O
brought O
up O
against O
me O
when O
my O
clock O
strikes O
. O
There O
, O
there O
, O
it O
is O
a O
cruel O
and O
a O
wicked O
world O
, O
and O
for O
a O
timid O
man O
I O
have O
been O
mixed O
up O
in O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
fighting O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
the O
rights O
of O
it O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
I O
have O
never O
stolen O
, O
though O
once O
I O
cheated O
a O
Kafir O
out O
of O
a O
herd O
of O
cattle O
. O
But O
then O
he O
had O
done O
me O
a O
dirty O
turn O
, O
and O
it O
has O
troubled O
me O
ever O
since O
into O
the O
bargain O
. O
Well O
, O
it O
is O
eighteen O
months O
or O
so O
ago O
since O
first O
I O
met O
Sir O
Henry O
Curtis O
and O
Captain O
Good O
. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
. O
I O
had O
been O
up O
elephant O
hunting O
beyond O
Bamangwato O
, O
and O
had O
met O
with O
bad O
luck O
. O
Everything O
went O
wrong O
that O
trip O
, O
and O
to O
top O
up O
with O
I O
got O
the O
fever O
badly O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
well O
enough O
I O
trekked O
down O
to O
the O
Diamond O
Fields O
, O
sold O
such O
ivory O
as O
I O
had O
, O
together O
with O
my O
wagon O
and O
oxen O
, O
discharged O
my O
hunters O
, O
and O
took O
the O
post-cart O
to O
the O
Cape O
. O
After O
spending O
a O
week O
in O
Cape O
Town O
, O
finding O
that O
they O
overcharged O
me O
at O
the O
hotel O
, O
and O
having O
seen O
everything O
there O
was O
to O
see O
, O
including O
the O
botanical O
gardens O
, O
which O
seem O
to O
me O
likely O
to O
confer O
a O
great O
benefit O
on O
the O
country O
, O
and O
the O
new O
Houses O
of O
Parliament O
, O
which O
I O
expect O
will O
do O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Natal O
by O
the O
_ O
Dunkeld O
_ O
, O
then O
lying O
at O
the O
docks O
waiting O
for O
the O
_ O
Edinburgh O
Castle O
_ O
due O
in O
from O
England O
. O
I O
took O
my O
berth O
and O
went O
aboard O
, O
and O
that O
afternoon O
the O
Natal O
passengers O
from O
the O
_ O
Edinburgh O
Castle O
_ O
transhipped O
, O
and O
we O
weighed O
and O
put O
to O
sea O
. O
Among O
these O
passengers O
who O
came O
on O
board O
were O
two O
who O
excited O
my O
curiosity O
. O
One O
, O
a O
gentleman O
of O
about O
thirty O
, O
was O
perhaps O
the O
biggest-chested O
and O
longest-armed O
man O
I O
ever O
saw O
. O
He O
had O
yellow O
hair O
, O
a O
thick O
yellow O
beard O
, O
clear-cut O
features O
, O
and O
large O
grey O
eyes O
set O
deep O
in O
his O
head O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
finer-looking O
man O
, O
and O
somehow O
he O
reminded O
me O
of O
an O
ancient O
Dane O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
know O
much O
of O
ancient O
Danes O
, O
though O
I O
knew O
a O
modern O
Dane O
who O
did O
me O
out O
of O
ten O
pounds O
; O
but O
I O
remember O
once O
seeing O
a O
picture O
of O
some O
of O
those O
gentry O
, O
who O
, O
I O
take O
it O
, O
were O
a O
kind O
of O
white O
Zulus O
. O
They O
were O
drinking O
out O
of O
big O
horns O
, O
and O
their O
long O
hair O
hung O
down O
their O
backs O
. O
As O
I O
looked O
at O
my O
friend O
standing O
there O
by O
the O
companion-ladder O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
if O
he O
only O
let O
his O
grow O
a O
little O
, O
put O
one O
of O
those O
chain O
shirts O
on O
to O
his O
great O
shoulders O
, O
and O
took O
hold O
of O
a O
battle-axe O
and O
a O
horn O
mug O
, O
he O
might O
have O
sat O
as O
a O
model O
for O
that O
picture O
. O
And O
by O
the O
way O
it O
is O
a O
curious O
thing O
, O
and O
just O
shows O
how O
the O
blood O
will O
out O
, O
I O
discovered O
afterwards O
that O
Sir O
Henry O
Curtis O
, O
for O
that O
was O
the O
big O
man O
's O
name O
, O
is O
of O
Danish O
blood O
. O
[ O
1 O
] O
He O
also O
reminded O
me O
strongly O
of O
somebody O
else O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
I O
could O
not O
remember O
who O
it O
was O
. O
The O
other O
man O
, O
who O
stood O
talking O
to O
Sir O
Henry O
, O
was O
stout O
and O
dark O
, O
and O
of O
quite O
a O
different O
cut O
. O
I O
suspected O
at O
once O
that O
he O
was O
a O
naval O
officer O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
mistake O
a O
navy O
man O
. O
I O
have O
gone O
shooting O
trips O
with O
several O
of O
them O
in O
the O
course O
of O
my O
life O
, O
and O
they O
have O
always O
proved O
themselves O
the O
best O
and O
bravest O
and O
nicest O
fellows O
I O
ever O
met O
, O
though O
sadly O
given O
, O
some O
of O
them O
, O
to O
the O
use O
of O
profane O
language O
. O
I O
asked O
a O
page O
or O
two O
back O
, O
what O
is O
a O
gentleman O
? O
I O
'll O
answer O
the O
question O
now O
: O
A O
Royal O
Naval O
officer O
is O
, O
in O
a O
general O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
though O
of O
course O
there O
may O
be O
a O
black O
sheep O
among O
them O
here O
and O
there O
. O
I O
fancy O
it O
is O
just O
the O
wide O
seas O
and O
the O
breath O
of O
God O
's O
winds O
that O
wash O
their O
hearts O
and O
blow O
the O
bitterness O
out O
of O
their O
minds O
and O
make O
them O
what O
men O
ought O
to O
be O
. O
Well O
, O
to O
return O
, O
I O
proved O
right O
again O
; O
I O
ascertained O
that O
the O
dark O
man O
_ O
was O
_ O
a O
naval O
officer O
, O
a O
lieutenant O
of O
thirty-one O
, O
who O
, O
after O
seventeen O
years O
' O
service O
, O
had O
been O
turned O
out O
of O
her O
Majesty O
's O
employ O
with O
the O
barren O
honour O
of O
a O
commander O
's O
rank O
, O
because O
it O
was O
impossible O
that O
he O
should O
be O
promoted O
. O
This O
is O
what O
people O
who O
serve O
the O
Queen O
have O
to O
expect O
: O
to O
be O
shot O
out O
into O
the O
cold O
world O
to O
find O
a O
living O
just O
when O
they O
are O
beginning O
really O
to O
understand O
their O
work O
, O
and O
to O
reach O
the O
prime O
of O
life O
. O
I O
suppose O
they O
do O
n't O
mind O
it O
, O
but O
for O
my O
own O
part O
I O
had O
rather O
earn O
my O
bread O
as O
a O
hunter O
. O
One O
's O
halfpence O
are O
as O
scarce O
perhaps O
, O
but O
you O
do O
not O
get O
so O
many O
kicks O
. O
The O
officer O
's O
name O
I O
found O
out O
-- O
by O
referring O
to O
the O
passengers O
' O
lists O
-- O
was O
Good O
-- O
Captain O
John O
Good O
. O
He O
was O
broad O
, O
of O
medium O
height O
, O
dark O
, O
stout O
, O
and O
rather O
a O
curious O
man O
to O
look O
at O
. O
He O
was O
so O
very O
neat O
and O
so O
very O
clean-shaved O
, O
and O
he O
always O
wore O
an O
eye-glass O
in O
his O
right O
eye O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
grow O
there O
, O
for O
it O
had O
no O
string O
, O
and O
he O
never O
took O
it O
out O
except O
to O
wipe O
it O
. O
At O
first O
I O
thought O
he O
used O
to O
sleep O
in O
it O
, O
but O
afterwards O
I O
found O
that O
this O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O
He O
put O
it O
in O
his O
trousers O
pocket O
when O
he O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
together O
with O
his O
false O
teeth O
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
two O
beautiful O
sets O
that O
, O
my O
own O
being O
none O
of O
the O
best O
, O
have O
often O
caused O
me O
to O
break O
the O
tenth O
commandment O

But O
I O

a O

in O
a O

all O

Then O

some O
sixty O

took O
place O

gin-pits O

elbowed O
aside O
by O

Lord PROP_PER

the O

first O
mine O
at O
Spinney O

on O
the O

About O
this O

the O
notorious O
Hell O

which O
through O
growing O
old O

acquired O
an O
evil O

Carston O

struck O
on O

so O

down O
the O

of O
the O
brooks O
from O
Selby O

Nuttall O
, O
new O
mines O
were O
sunk O

down O
to O
Spinney O
Park O
, O
then O
on O
to O
Minton O
, O
a O
large O
mine O
among O
corn-fields O
; O
from O
Minton O
across O
the O
farmlands O

the O
valleyside O

Bunker O

Hill O

branching O
off O

running O
north O
to O
Beggarlee O

Selby O
, O
that O
looks O
over O
at O
Crich O
and O
the O
hills O
of O
Derbyshire O
: O
six O
mines O
like O
black O
studs O
on O
the O
countryside O
, O
linked O
by O
a O
loop O
of O
fine O
chain O
, O
the O
railway O
. O
To O
accommodate O
the O
regiments O
of O
miners NOM_PER
, O
Carston O
, O
Waite O
and O
Co. O
built O
the O
Squares O
, O
great O
quadrangles O
of O
dwellings O
on O
the O
hillside O
of O
Bestwood O
, O
and O
then O
, O
in O
the O
brook O
valley O
, O
on O
the O
site O
of O
Hell O
Row O
, O
they O
erected O
the O
Bottoms O
. O
The O
Bottoms O
consisted O
of O
six O
blocks O
of O
miners NOM_PER
' O
dwellings O
, O
two O
rows O
of O
three O
, O
like O
the O
dots O
on O
a O
blank-six O
domino O
, O
and O
twelve O
houses O
in O
a O
block O
. O
This O
double O
row O
of O
dwellings O
sat O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
rather O
sharp O
slope O
from O
Bestwood O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
, O
from O
the O
attic O
windows O
at O
least O
, O
on O
the O
slow O
climb O
of O
the O
valley O
towards O
Selby O
. O
The O
houses O
themselves O
were O
substantial O
and O
very O
decent O
. O
One O
could O
walk O
all O
round O
, O
seeing O
little O
front O
gardens O
with O
auriculas O
and O
saxifrage O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
bottom O
block O
, O
sweet-williams O
and O
pinks O
in O
the O
sunny O
top O
block O
; O
seeing O
neat O
front O
windows O
, O
little O
porches O
, O
little O
privet O
hedges O
, O
and O
dormer O
windows O
for O
the O
attics O
. O
But O
that O
was O
outside O
; O
that O
was O
the O
view O
on O
to O
the O
uninhabited O
parlours O
of O
all NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
colliers NOM_PER
' NOM_PER
wives NOM_PER
. O
The O
dwelling-room O
, O
the O
kitchen O
, O
was O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
house O
, O
facing O
inward O
between O
the O
blocks O
, O
looking O
at O
a O
scrubby O
back O
garden O
, O
and O
then O
at O
the O
ash-pits O
. O
And O
between O
the O
rows O
, O
between O
the O
long O
lines O
of O
ash-pits O
, O
went O
the O
alley O
, O
where O
the O
children O
played O
and O
the O
women O
gossiped O
and O
the O
men O
smoked O
. O
So O
, O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
living O
in O
the O
Bottoms O
, O
that O
was O
so O
well O
built O
and O
that O
looked O
so O
nice O
, O
were O
quite O
unsavoury O
because O
people O
must O
live O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
the O
kitchens O
opened O
on O
to O
that O
nasty O
alley O
of O
ash-pits O
. O
Mrs. O
Morel O
was O
not O
anxious O
to O
move O
into O
the O
Bottoms O
, O
which O
was O
already O
twelve O
years O
old O
and O
on O
the O
downward O
path O
, O
when O
she O
descended O
to O
it O
from O
Bestwood O
. O
But O
it O
was O
the O
best O
she O
could O
do O
. O
Moreover O
, O
she O
had O
an O
end O
house O
in O
one O
of O
the O
top O
blocks O
, O
and O
thus O
had O
only O
one O
neighbour O
; O
on O
the O
other O
side O
an O
extra O
strip O
of O
garden O
. O
And O
, O
having O
an O
end O
house O
, O
she O
enjoyed O
a O
kind O
of O
aristocracy O
among O
the O
other O
women O
of O
the O
" O
between O
" O
houses O
, O
because O
her O
rent O
was O
five O
shillings O
and O
sixpence O
instead O
of O
five O
shillings O
a O
week O
. O
But O
this O
superiority O
in O
station O
was O
not O
much O
consolation O
to O
Mrs. O
Morel O
. O
She O
was O
thirty-one O
years O
old O
, O
and O
had O
been O
married O
eight O
years O
. O
A O
rather O
small O
woman O
, O
of O
delicate O
mould O
but O
resolute O
bearing O
, O
she O
shrank O
a O
little O
from O
the O
first O
contact O
with O
the O
Bottoms O
women O
. O
She O
came O
down O
in O
the O
July O
, O
and O
in O
the O
September O
expected O
her O
third O
baby O
. O
Her O
husband O
was O
a O
miner O
. O
They O
had O
only O
been O
in O
their O
new O
home O
three O
weeks O
when O
the O
wakes O
, O
or O
fair O
, O
began O
. O
Morel O
, O
she O
knew O
, O
was O
sure O
to O
make O
a O
holiday O
of O
it O
. O
He O
went O
off O
early O
on O
the O
Monday O
morning O
, O
the O
day O
of O
the O
fair O
. O
The O
two O
children O
were O
highly O
excited O
. O
William O
, O
a O
boy O
of O
seven O
, O
fled O
off O
immediately O
after O
breakfast O
, O
to O
prowl O
round O
the O
wakes O
ground O
, O
leaving O
Annie O
, O
who O
was O
only O
five O
, O
to O
whine O
all O
morning O
to O
go O
also O
. O
Mrs. O
Morel O
did O
her O
work O
. O
She O
scarcely O
knew O
her O
neighbours O
yet O
, O
and O
knew O
no O
one O
with O
whom O
to O
trust O
the O
little O
girl O
. O
So O
she O
promised O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
wakes O
after O
dinner O
. O
William O
appeared O
at O
half-past O
twelve O
. O
He O
was O
a O
very O
active O
lad O
, O
fair-haired O
, O
freckled O
, O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
the O
Dane O
or O
Norwegian O
about O
him O
. O
" O
Can O
I O
have O
my O
dinner O
, O
mother O
? O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
rushing O
in O
with O
his O
cap O
on O
. O
" O
'Cause O
it O
begins O
at O
half-past O
one O
, O
the O
man O
says O
so O
. O
" O
" O
You O

have O
your O
dinner O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
's O
done O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
mother O
. O
" O
Is O
n't O
it O
done O
? O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
his O
blue O
eyes O
staring O
at O
her O
in O
indignation O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
'm O
goin O
' O
be-out O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You O
'll O
do O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
. O
It O
will O
be O
done O
in O
five O
minutes O
. O
It O
is O
only O
half-past O
twelve O
. O
" O
" O
They O
'll O
be O
beginnin O
' O
, O
" O
the O
boy O
half O
cried O
, O
half O
shouted O
. O
" O
You O
wo O
n't O
die O
if O
they O
do O
, O
" O
said O
the O
mother O
. O
" O
Besides O
, O
it O
's O
only O
half-past O
twelve O
, O
so O
you O
've O
a O
full O
hour O
. O
" O
The O
lad O
began O
hastily O
to O
lay O
the O
table O
, O
and O
directly O
the O
three O
sat O
down O
. O
They O
were O
eating O
batter-pudding O
and O
jam O
, O
when O
the O
boy O
jumped O
off O
his O
chair O
and O
stood O
perfectly O
stiff O
. O
Some O
distance O
away O
could O
be O
heard O
the O
first O
small O
braying O
of O
a O
merry-go-round O
, O
and O
the O
tooting O
of O
a O
horn O
. O
His O
face O
quivered O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
his O
mother O
. O
" O
I O
told O
you O
! O
" O
he O
said O
, O
running O
to O
the O
dresser O
for O
his O
cap O
. O
" O
Take O
your O
pudding O
in O
your O
hand O
-- O
and O
it O
's O
only O
five O
past O
one O
, O
so O
you O
were O
wrong O
-- O
you O
have O
n't O
got O
your O
twopence O
, O
" O
cried O
the O
mother O
in O
a O
breath O
. O
The O
boy O
came O
back O
, O
bitterly O
disappointed O
, O
for O
his O
twopence O
, O
then O
went O
off O
without O
a O
word O
. O
" O
I O
want O
to O
go O
, O
I O
want O
to O
go O
, O
" O
said O
Annie O
, O
beginning O
to O
cry O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
and O
you O
shall O
go O
, O
whining O
, O
wizzening O
little O
stick O
! O
" O
said O
the O
mother O
. O
And O
later O
in O
the O
afternoon O
she O
trudged O
up O
the O
hill O
under O
the O
tall O
hedge O
with O
her O
child O
. O
The O
hay O
was O
gathered O
from O
the O
fields O
, O
and O
cattle O
were O
turned O
on O
to O
the O
eddish O

It O
was O
warm O
, O
peaceful O
. O
Mrs. O
Morel O
did O
not O
like O
the O
wakes O
. O
There O
were O
two O
sets O
of O
horses O
, O
one O
going O
by O
steam O
, O
one O
pulled O
round O
by O
a O
pony O
; O
three O
organs O
were O
grinding O
, O
and O
there O
came O
odd O
cracks O
of O
pistol-shots O
, O
fearful O
screeching O
of O
the O
cocoanut O
man O
's O
rattle O
, O
shouts O
of O
the O
Aunt O
Sally O
man O
, O
screeches O
from O
the O
peep-show O
lady O
. O
The O
mother O
perceived O
her O
son O
gazing O
enraptured O
outside O
the O
Lion O
Wallace O
booth O
, O
at O
the O
pictures O
of O
this O
famous O
lion O
that O
had O
killed O
a O
negro O
and O
maimed O
for O
life O
two O
white O
men O
. O
She O
left O
him O
alone O
, O
and O
went O
to O
get O
Annie O
a O
spin O
of O
toffee O
. O
Presently O
the O
lad O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
wildly O
excited O
. O
" O
You O
never O
said O
you O
was O
coming O
-- O

-- O

" O
He O
pulled O
from O
his O
pocket O
two O
egg-cups O
, O
with O
pink O
moss-roses O
on O
them O
. O
" O
I O
got O

" O
She O
knew O
he O
wanted O
them O
for O
her O
. O
" O
H O

" O
she O
said O
, O
pleased O
. O
" O

" O
" O

" O
He O
was O
tipful O
of O
excitement O
now O
she O
had O
come O
, O
led O
her O
about O
the O
ground O
, O
showed O
her O
everything O
. O
Then O
, O
at O
the O
peep-show O
, O
she O
explained O
the O
pictures O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
story O
, O
to O
which O
he O
listened O
as O
if O
spellbound O
. O
He O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
. O
All O
the O
time O
he O
stuck O
close O
to O
her O
, O
bristling O
with O
a O
small O
boy O
's O
pride O
of O
her O
. O
For O
no O
other O
woman O
looked O
such O
a O
lady O
as O
she O
did O
, O
in O
her O
little O
black O
bonnet O
and O
her O
cloak O
. O
She O
smiled O
when O
she O
saw O
women O
she O
knew O
. O
When O
she O
was O
tired O
she O
said O
to O
her O
son O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
are O
you O
coming O
now O
, O
or O
later O
? O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
goin O
' O
a O
' O
ready O
? O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
his O
face O
full O
of O
reproach O
. O
" O
Already O
? O
It O
is O
past O
four O
, O
I O
know O
. O
" O
" O
What O
are O
you O
goin O
' O
a O
' O
ready O
for O
? O
" O
he O
lamented O
. O
" O
You O
need O
n't O
come O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
And O
she O
went O
slowly O
away O
with O
her O
little O
girl O
, O
whilst O
her O
son O
stood O
watching O
her O
, O
cut O
to O
the O
heart O
to O
let O
her O
go O
, O
and O
yet O
unable O
to O
leave O
the O
wakes O
. O
As O
she O
crossed O
the O
open O
ground O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Moon O
and O
Stars O
she O
heard O
men O
shouting O
, O
and O
smelled O
the O
beer O
, O
and O
hurried O
a O
little O
, O
thinking O
her O
husband O
was O
probably O
in O
the O
bar O
. O
At O
about O
half-past O
six O
her O
son O
came O
home O
, O
tired O
now O
, O
rather O
pale O
, O
and O
somewhat O
wretched O
. O
He O
was O
miserable O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
know O
it O
, O
because O
he O
had O
let O
her O
go O
alone O
. O
Since O
she O
had O
gone O
, O
he O
had O
not O
enjoyed O
his O
wakes O
. O
" O
Has O
my O
dad O
been O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
said O
the O
mother O
. O

I O
The O
Nellie O
, O
a O
cruising O
yawl O
, O
swung O
to O
her O
anchor O
without O
a O
flutter O
of O
the O
sails O
, O
and O
was O
at O
rest O
. O
The O
flood O
had O
made O
, O
the O
wind O
was O
nearly O
calm O
, O
and O
being O
bound O
down O
the O
river O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
for O
it O
was O
to O
come O
to O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
tide O
. O
The O
sea-reach O
of O
the O
Thames O
stretched O
before O
us PRON_PER
like O
the O
beginning O
of O
an O
interminable O
waterway O
. O
In O
the O
offing O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
sky O
were O
welded O
together O
without O
a O
joint O
, O
and O
in O
the O
luminous O
space O
the O
tanned O
sails O
of O
the O
barges O
drifting O
up O
with O
the O
tide O
seemed O
to O
stand O
still O
in O
red O
clusters O
of O
canvas O
sharply O
peaked O
, O
with O
gleams O
of O
varnished O
sprits O
. O
A O
haze O
rested O
on O
the O
low O
shores O
that O
ran O
out O
to O
sea O
in O
vanishing O
flatness O
. O
The O
air O
was O
dark O
above O
Gravesend O
, O
and O
farther O
back O
still O
seemed O
condensed O
into O
a O
mournful O
gloom O
, O
brooding O
motionless O
over O
the O
biggest O
, O
and O
the O
greatest O
, O
town O
on O
earth O
. O
The NOM_PER
Director NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
Companies NOM_PER
was O
our NOM_PER
captain NOM_PER
and O
our O
host O
. O
We O
four O
affectionately O
watched O
his O
back O
as O
he O
stood O
in O
the O
bows O
looking O
to O
seaward O
. O
On O
the O
whole O
river O
there O
was O
nothing O
that O
looked O
half O
so O
nautical O
. O
He O
resembled O
a O
pilot O
, O
which O
to O
a O
seaman O
is O
trustworthiness O
personified O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
realize O
his O
work O
was O
not O
out O
there O
in O
the O
luminous O
estuary O
, O
but O
behind O
him O
, O
within O
the O
brooding O
gloom O
. O
Between O
us O
there O
was O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
said O
somewhere O
, O
the O
bond O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
Besides O
holding O
our O
hearts O
together O
through O
long O
periods O
of O
separation O
, O
it O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
making O
us O
tolerant O
of O
each O
other O
's O
yarns O
-- O
and O
even O
convictions O
. O
The O
Lawyer O
-- O
the O
best O
of O
old O
fellows O
-- O
had O
, O
because O
of O
his O
many O
years O
and O
many O
virtues O
, O
the O
only O
cushion O
on O
deck O
, O
and O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
only O
rug O
. O
The O
Accountant O
had O
brought O
out O
already O
a O
box O
of O
dominoes O
, O
and O
was O
toying O
architecturally O
with O
the O
bones O
. O
Marlow O
sat O
cross-legged O
right O
aft O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
mizzen-mast O
. O
He O
had O
sunken O
cheeks O
, O
a O
yellow O
complexion O
, O
a O
straight O
back O
, O
an O
ascetic O
aspect O
, O
and O
, O
with O
his O
arms O
dropped O
, O
the O
palms O
of O
hands O
outwards O
, O
resembled O
an O
idol O
. O
The O
director O
, O
satisfied O
the O
anchor O
had O
good O
hold O
, O
made O
his O
way O
aft O
and O
sat O
down O
amongst O
us O
. O
We O
exchanged O
a O
few O
words O
lazily O
. O
Afterwards O
there O
was O
silence O
on O
board O
the O
yacht O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
or O
other O
we O
did O
not O
begin O
that O
game O
of O
dominoes O
. O
We O
felt O
meditative O
, O
and O
fit O
for O
nothing O
but O
placid O
staring O
. O
The O
day O
was O
ending O
in O
a O
serenity O
of O
still O
and O
exquisite O
brilliance O
. O
The O
water O
shone O
pacifically O
; O
the O
sky O
, O
without O
a O
speck O
, O
was O
a O
benign O
immensity O
of O
unstained O
light O
; O
the O
very O
mist O
on O
the O
Essex O
marsh O
was O
like O
a O
gauzy O
and O
radiant O
fabric O
, O
hung O
from O
the O
wooded O
rises O
inland O
, O
and O
draping O
the O
low O
shores O
in O
diaphanous O
folds O
. O
Only O
the O
gloom O
to O
the O
west O
, O
brooding O
over O
the O
upper O
reaches O
, O
became O
more O
sombre O
every O
minute O
, O
as O
if O
angered O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
And O
at O
last O
, O
in O
its O
curved O
and O
imperceptible O
fall O
, O
the O
sun O
sank O
low O
, O
and O
from O
glowing O
white O
changed O
to O
a O
dull O
red O
without O
rays O
and O
without O
heat O
, O
as O
if O
about O
to O
go O
out O
suddenly O
, O
stricken O
to O
death O
by O
the O
touch O
of O
that O
gloom O
brooding O
over O
a O
crowd O
of O
men O
. O
Forthwith O
a O
change O
came O
over O
the O
waters O
, O
and O
the O
serenity O
became O
less O
brilliant O
but O
more O
profound O
. O
The O
old O
river O
in O
its O
broad O
reach O
rested O
unruffled O
at O
the O
decline O
of O
day O
, O
after O
ages O
of O
good O
service O
done O
to O
the O
race O
that O
peopled O
its O
banks O
, O
spread O
out O
in O
the O
tranquil O
dignity O
of O
a O
waterway O
leading O
to O
the O
uttermost O
ends O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
We O
looked O
at O
the O
venerable O
stream O
not O
in O
the O
vivid O
flush O
of O
a O
short O
day O
that O
comes O
and O
departs O
for O
ever O
, O
but O
in O
the O
august O
light O
of O
abiding O
memories O
. O
And O
indeed O
nothing O
is O
easier O
for O
a O
man O
who O
has O
, O
as O
the O
phrase O
goes O
, O
" O
followed O
the O
sea O
" O
with O
reverence O
and O
affection O
, O
than O
to O
evoke O
the O
great O
spirit O
of O
the O
past O
upon O
the O
lower O
reaches O
of O
the O
Thames O
. O
The O
tidal O
current O
runs O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
its O
unceasing O
service O
, O
crowded O
with O
memories O
of O
men O
and O
ships O
it O
had O
borne O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
home O
or O
to O
the O
battles O
of O
the O
sea O

It O
had O
known O

served O
all O
the O

the O

proud O
, O
from O
Sir O

, O

all O
, O

-- O
the O
great O
knights-errant O
of O
the O

It O
had O
borne O
all O
the O
ships O
whose O
names O
are O
like O
jewels O
flashing O
in O
the O
night O
of O
time O
, O
from O
the O

with O
her O
rotund O

full O
of O

to O

they O
all O
had O
gone O
out O
on O
that O
stream O
, O
bearing O
the O
sword O
, O
and O
often O
the O
torch O
, O
messengers O
of O
the O

within O

, O
bearers O
of O
a O
spark O
from O

What O
greatness O
had O
not O
floated O
on O
the O
ebb O
of O

river O
into O
the O
mystery O
of O
an O

... O
The O
dreams O
of O

, O
the O

The O
sun O
set O
; O
the O
dusk O
fell O
on O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
lights O
began O
to O
appear O
along O
the O
shore O
. O
The O
Chapman O
light-house O
, O
a O
three-legged O
thing O
erect O
on O
a O
mud-flat O
, O
shone O
strongly O
. O
Lights O
of O
ships O
moved O
in O
the O
fairway O
-- O
a O
great O
stir O
of O
lights O
going O
up O
and O
going O
down O
. O
And O
farther O
west O
on O
the O
upper O
reaches O
the O
place O
of O
the O
monstrous O
town O
was O
still O
marked O
ominously O
on O
the O
sky O
, O
a O
brooding O
gloom O
in O
sunshine O
, O
a O
lurid O
glare O
under O
the O
stars O
. O
" O
And O
this O
also O
, O
" O
said O
Marlow O
suddenly O
, O
" O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
dark O
places O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
" O
He O
was O
the O
only O
man O
of O
us O
who O
still O
" O
followed O
the O
sea O
. O
" O
The O
worst O
that O
could O
be O
said O
of O
him O
was O
that O
he O
did O
not O
represent O
his O
class O
. O
He O
was O
a O
seaman O
, O
but O
he O
was O
a O
wanderer O
, O
too O
, O
while O
most O
seamen O
lead O
, O
if O
one O
may O
so O
express O
it O
, O
a O
sedentary O
life O
. O
Their O
minds O
are O
of O
the O
stay-at-home O
order O
, O
and O
their O
home O
is O
always O
with O
them O
-- O
the O
ship O
; O
and O
so O
is O
their O
country O
-- O
the O
sea O
. O
One O
ship O
is O
very O
much O
like O
another O
, O
and O
the O
sea O
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O
In O
the O
immutability O
of O
their O
surroundings O
the O
foreign O
shores O
, O
the O
foreign O
faces O

the O
changing O
immensity O
of O
life O
, O
glide O
past O
, O
veiled O
not O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
mystery O
but O
by O
a O
slightly O
disdainful O
ignorance O
; O
for O
there O
is O
nothing O
mysterious O
to O
a O
seaman O
unless O
it O
be O
the O
sea O
itself O
, O
which O
is O
the O
mistress O
of O
his O
existence O
and O
as O
inscrutable O
as O
Destiny O
. O
For O
the O
rest O

after O
his O
hours O
of O
work O
, O
a O
casual O
stroll O

a O
casual O
spree O

to O
unfold O

him O

secret O
of O
a O
whole O
continent O
, O
and O
generally O
he O
finds O
the O
secret O
not O
worth O
knowing O
. O
The O
yarns O
of O
seamen O
have O
a O
direct O
simplicity O
, O
the O
whole O
meaning O
of O
which O
lies O
within O
the O
shell O
of O
a O
cracked O
nut O
. O
But O
Marlow O
was O
not O
typical O
( O
if O
his O
propensity O
to O
spin O
yarns O
be O
excepted O
) O
, O
and O
to O
him O
the O
meaning O
of O
an O
episode O
was O
not O
inside O
like O
a O
kernel O
but O
outside O
, O
enveloping O
the O
tale O
which O
brought O
it O
out O
only O
as O
a O
glow O
brings O
out O
a O
haze O
, O
in O
the O
likeness O
of O
one O
of O
these O
misty O
halos O
that O
sometimes O
are O
made O
visible O
by O
the O
spectral O
illumination O
of O
moonshine O
. O
His O
remark O
did O
not O
seem O
at O
all O
surprising O
. O
It O
was O
just O
like O
Marlow O
. O
It O
was O
accepted O
in O
silence O
. O
No O
one O
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
grunt O
even O
; O
and O
presently O
he O
said O
, O
very O
slow O
-- O
" O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
very O

times O

Yes O

it O
is O
like O
a O
running O

her PRON_PER

of O

and O
four O

It O
was O
in O
August O
, O
1889 O
. O
She O
was O
eighteen O
years O
of O
age O
, O
bright O
, O
timid O
, O
and O
full O
of O
the O
illusions O
of O
ignorance O
and O
youth O
. O
Whatever O
touch O
of O
regret O
at O
parting O
characterised O
her O
thoughts O
, O
it O
was O
certainly O
not O
for O
advantages O
now O
being O
given O
up O
. O
A O
gush O
of O
tears O
at O
her O
mother O
's O
farewell O
kiss O
, O
a O
touch O
in O
her O
throat O
when O
the O
cars O
clacked O
by O
the O
flour O
mill O
where O
her O
father O
worked O
by O
the O
day O
, O
a O
pathetic O
sigh O
as O
the O
familiar O
green O
environs O
of O
the O
village O
passed O
in O
review O
, O
and O
the O
threads O
which O
bound O
her O
so O
lightly O
to O
girlhood O
and O
home O
were O
irretrievably O
broken O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
there O
was O
always O
the O
next O
station O
, O
where O
one O
might O
descend O
and O
return O
. O
There O
was O
the O
great O
city O
, O
bound O
more O
closely O
by O
these O
very O
trains O
which O
came O
up O
daily O
. O
Columbia O
City O
was O
not O
so O
very O
far O
away O
, O
even O
once O
she O
was O
in O
Chicago O
. O
What O
, O
pray O
, O
is O
a O
few O
hours O
-- O
a O
few O
hundred O
miles O
? O
She O
looked O
at O
the O
little O
slip O
bearing O
her O
sister O
's O
address O
and O
wondered O
. O
She O
gazed O
at O
the O
green O
landscape O
, O
now O
passing O
in O
swift O
review O
, O
until O
her O
swifter O
thoughts O
replaced O
its O
impression O
with O
vague O
conjectures O
of O
what O
Chicago O
might O
be O
. O
When O
a O
girl O
leaves O
her O
home O
at O
eighteen O
, O
she O
does O
one O
of O
two O
things O
. O
Either O
she O
falls O
into O
saving O
hands O
and O
becomes O
better O
, O
or O
she O
rapidly O
assumes O
the O
cosmopolitan O
standard O
of O
virtue O
and O
becomes O
worse O
. O
Of O
an O
intermediate O
balance O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
there O
is O
no O
possibility O
. O
The O
city O
has O
its O
cunning O
wiles O
, O
no O
less O
than O
the O
infinitely O
smaller O
and O
more O
human O
tempter O
. O
There O
are O
large O
forces O
which O
allure O
with O
all O
the O
soulfulness O
of O
expression O
possible O
in O
the O
most O
cultured O
human O
. O
The O
gleam O
of O
a O
thousand O
lights O
is O
often O
as O
effective O
as O
the O
persuasive O
light O
in O
a O
wooing O
and O
fascinating O
eye O
. O
Half O
the O
undoing O
of O
the O
unsophisticated O
and O
natural O
mind O
is O
accomplished O
by O
forces O
wholly O
superhuman O

Caroline O
, O
or O
Sister O
Carrie O
, O
as O
she O
had O
been O
half O
affectionately O
termed O
by O
the O
family O
, O
was O
possessed O
of O
a O
mind O
rudimentary O
in O
its O
power O
of O
observation O
and O
analysis O
. O
Self-interest O
with O
her O
was O
high O
, O
but O
not O
strong O
. O
It O
was O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
her O
guiding O
characteristic O
. O
Warm O
with O
the O
fancies O
of O
youth O
, O
pretty O
with O
the O
insipid O
prettiness O
of O
the O
formative O
period O
, O
possessed O
of O
a O
figure O
promising O
eventual O
shapeliness O
and O
an O
eye O
alight O
with O
certain O
native O
intelligence O
, O
she O
was O
a O
fair O
example O
of O
the O
middle O
American O
class O
-- O
two O
generations O
removed O
from O
the O
emigrant O
. O
Books O
were O
beyond O
her O
interest O
-- O
knowledge O
a O
sealed O
book O
. O
In O
the O
intuitive O
graces O
she O
was O
still O
crude O
. O
She O
could O
scarcely O
toss O
her O
head O
gracefully O
. O
Her O
hands O
were O
almost O
ineffectual O
. O
The O
feet O
, O
though O
small O
, O
were O
set O
flatly O
. O
And O
yet O
she O
was O
interested O
in O
her O
charms O
, O
quick O
to O
understand O
the O
keener O
pleasures O
of O
life O
, O
ambitious O
to O
gain O
in O
material O
things O
. O
A O
half-equipped O
little O
knight O
she O
was O
, O
venturing O
to O
reconnoitre O
the O
mysterious O
city O
and O
dreaming O
wild O
dreams O
of O
some O
vague O
, O
far-off O
supremacy O
, O
which O
should O
make O
it O
prey O
and O
subject O
-- O
the O
proper O
penitent O
, O
grovelling O
at O
a O
woman O
's O
slipper O
. O
" O
That O
, O
" O
said O
a O
voice O
in O
her O
ear O
, O
" O
is O
one O
of O
the O
prettiest O
little O
resorts O
in O
Wisconsin O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
it O
? O
" O
she O
answered O
nervously O
. O
The O
train O
was O
just O
pulling O
out O
of O
Waukesha O
. O
For O
some O
time O
she O
had O
been O
conscious O
of O
a O
man O
behind O
. O
She O
felt O
him O
observing O
her O
mass O
of O
hair O
. O
He O
had O
been O
fidgetting O
, O
and O
with O
natural O
intuition O
she O
felt O
a O
certain O
interest O
growing O
in O
that O
quarter O
. O
Her O
maidenly O
reserve O
, O
and O
a O
certain O
sense O
of O
what O
was O
conventional O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
called O
her O
to O
forestall O
and O
deny O
this O
familiarity O
, O
but O
the O
daring O
and O
magnetism O
of O
the O
individual O
, O
born O
of O
past O
experiences O
and O
triumphs O
, O
prevailed O
. O
She O
answered O
. O
He O
leaned O
forward O
to O
put O
his O
elbows O
upon O
the O
back O
of O
her O
seat O
and O
proceeded O
to O
make O
himself O
volubly O
agreeable O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
that O
is O
a O
great O
resort O
for O
Chicago O
people O
. O
The O
hotels O
are O
swell O

you O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
am O

" O
answered O
Carrie O
. O
" O
That O
is O
, O
I O
live O
at O
Columbia O
City O
. O
I O
have O
never O
been O

" O
" O
And O
so O
this O
is O
your O
first O
visit O
to O
Chicago O
, O
" O
he O
observed O
. O
All O
the O
time O
she O
was O
conscious O
of O
certain O
features O
out O
of O
the O
side O
of O
her O
eye O
. O
Flush O
, O
colourful O
cheeks O
, O
a O
light O
moustache O
, O
a O
grey O
fedora O
hat O
. O
She O
now O
turned O
and O
looked O
upon O
him O
in O
full O
, O
the O
instincts O
of O
self-protection O
and O
coquetry O
mingling O
confusedly O
in O
her O
brain O
. O
" O
I O
did O
n't O
say O
that O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
in O
a O
very O
pleasing O
way O
and O
with O
an O
assumed O
air O
of O
mistake O
, O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
did O
. O
" O
Here O
was O
a O
type O
of O
the O
travelling O
canvasser O
for O
a O
manufacturing O
house O

a O
class O
which O
at O
that O
time O
was O
first O
being O
dubbed O
by O
the O
slang O
of O
the O
day O
" O
drummers O
. O
" O
He O
came O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
a O
still O
newer O
term O
, O
which O
had O
sprung O
into O
general O
use O
among O
Americans O
in O
1880 O
, O
and O
which O
concisely O
expressed O
the O
thought O
of O
one O
whose O
dress O
or O
manners O
are O
calculated O
to O
elicit O
the O
admiration O
of O
susceptible O
young O
women O
-- O
a O
" O
masher O
. O
" O
His O
suit O
was O
of O
a O
striped O
and O
crossed O
pattern O
of O
brown O
wool O
, O
new O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
since O
become O
familiar O
as O
a O
business O
suit O
. O
The O
low O
crotch O
of O
the O
vest O
revealed O
a O
stiff O
shirt O
bosom O
of O
white O
and O
pink O
stripes O
. O
From O
his O
coat O
sleeves O
protruded O
a O
pair O
of O
linen O
cuffs O
of O
the O
same O
pattern O
, O
fastened O
with O
large O
, O
gold O
plate O

set O
with O
the O
common O
yellow O
agates O
known O
as O

cat O

" O
His O
fingers O
bore O
several O
rings O

one O
, O
the O
ever-enduring O
heavy O
seal O

from O
his O
vest O
dangled O
a O
neat O
gold O
watch O
chain O
, O
from O
which O
was O
suspended O
the O
secret O
insignia O
of O
the O
Order O
of O
Elks O
. O
The O
whole O
suit O
was O
rather O
tight-fitting O
, O
and O
was O
finished O
off O
with O
heavy-soled O
tan O
shoes O
, O
highly O
polished O
, O
and O
the O
grey O
fedora O

was O

for O
the O
order O

some O
of O
the O
most O
striking O
characteristics O
of O
his O
most O
successful O
manner O
and O
method O
. O
Good O
clothes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
the O
first O
essential O
, O
the O
things O
without O
which O
he O
was O
nothing O
. O
A O
strong O
physical O
nature O
, O
actuated O
by O
a O
keen O
desire O
for O
the O
feminine O
, O
was O
the O
next O
. O
A O
mind O
free O
of O
any O
consideration O
of O
the O
problems O
or O
forces O
of O
the O
world O
and O
actuated O
not O
by O
greed O
, O
but O
an O
insatiable O
love O
of O
variable O
pleasure O
. O
His O
method O
was O
always O
simple O
. O
Its O
principal O
element O
was O
daring O
, O
backed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
by O
an O
intense O
desire O
and O
admiration O
for O
the O
sex O
. O
Let O
him O
meet O
with O
a O
young O
woman O
once O
and O
he O
would O
approach O
her O
with O
an O
air O
of O
kindly O
familiarity O
, O
not O
unmixed O
with O
pleading O
, O
which O
would O
result O
in O
most O
cases O
in O
a O
tolerant O
acceptance O
. O
If O
she O
showed O
any O
tendency O
to O
coquetry O
he O
would O
be O
apt O
to O
straighten O
her O
tie O
, O
or O
if O
she O
" O
took O
up O
" O
with O
him O
at O
all O
, O
to O
call O
her O
by O
her O
first O
name O
. O
If O
he O
visited O
a O
department O
store O
it O
was O
to O
lounge O
familiarly O
over O
the O
counter O
and O
ask O
some O
leading O
questions O
. O
In O
more O
exclusive O
circles O
, O
on O
the O
train O
or O
in O
waiting O
stations O
, O
he O
went O
slower O
. O
If O
some O
seemingly O
vulnerable O
object O
appeared O
he O
was O
all O
attention O
-- O
to O
pass O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O
day O
, O
to O
lead O
the O
way O
to O
the O
parlor O
car O
, O
carrying O
her O
grip O
, O
or O
, O
failing O
that O
, O
to O
take O
a O
seat O
next O
her O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
able O
to O
court O
her O
to O
her O
destination O
. O
Pillows O
, O
books O
, O
a O
footstool O
, O
the O
shade O
lowered O
; O
all O
these O
figured O
in O
the O
things O
which O
he O
could O
do O
. O
If O
, O
when O
she O
reached O
her O
destination O
he O
did O
not O
alight O
and O
attend O
her O
baggage O
for O
her O
, O
it O
was O
because O
, O
in O
his O
own O
estimation O
, O
he O
had O
signally O
failed O
. O
A O
woman O
should O
some O
day O
write O
the O
complete O
philosophy O
of O
clothes O
. O
No O
matter O
how O
young O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
she O
wholly O
comprehends O
. O
There O
is O
an O
indescribably O
faint O
line O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
man O
's O
apparel O
which O
somehow O
divides O
for O
her O
those O
who O
are O
worth O
glancing O
at O
and O
those O
who O
are O
not O
. O
Once O
an O
individual O
has O
passed O
this O
faint O
line O
on O
the O
way O
downward O
he O
will O
get O
no O
glance O
from O
her O
. O
There O
is O
another O
line O
at O
which O
the O
dress O
of O
a O
man O
will O
cause O
her O
to O
study O
her O
own O
. O
This O
line O
the O
individual O
at O
her O
elbow O
now O
marked O
for O
Carrie O
. O
She O
became O
conscious O
of O
an O
inequality O
. O
Her O
own O
plain O
blue O
dress O
, O
with O
its O
black O
cotton O
tape O
trimmings O
, O
now O
seemed O
to O
her O
shabby O
. O
She O
felt O
the O
worn O
state O
of O
her O
shoes O
. O
" O
Let O

she O
interrupted O
, O
aroused O
by O
memories O
of O
longings O
their O
show O
windows O
had O
cost O
her O
. O
At O
last O
he O
had O
a O
clew O
to O
her O
interest O
, O
and O
followed O
it O
deftly O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
he O
had O
come O
about O
into O
her O
seat O
. O
He O
talked O
of O
sales O
of O
clothing O
, O
his O
travels O
, O
Chicago O
, O
and O
the O
amusements O
of O
that O
city O

There O
was O
a O
little O
ache O

of O

described O
. O
Her O
insignificance O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
so O
much O
magnificence O
faintly O
affected O
her O
. O
She O
realised O
that O
hers O
was O
not O
to O
be O
a O
round O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
yet O
there O
was O
something O
promising O
in O
all O
the O
material O
prospect O

set O
forth O
. O
There O
was O
something O
satisfactory O
in O
the O
attention O
of O
this O
individual O
with O
his O
good O
clothes O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
smiling O
as O
he O
told O
her O
of O
some O
popular O
actress O
of O
whom O
she O
reminded O
him O
. O
She O
was O
not O
silly O

its O
weight O

you O

the O
use O
of O
opium O

and O
is O
this O
the O
raving O
of O
two O
fevered O
imaginations O
? O
I O
am O
exactly O
as O
well O
fitted O
to O
take O
care O
of O
one O
hundred O
children O
as O
to O
become O
the O
curator O
of O

zoo O

And O
you O
offer O
as O
bait O
an O
interesting O
Scotch O
doctor O
? O
My O
dear O
Judy O
, O
-- O
likewise O
my O
dear O
Jervis O
, O
-- O
I O
see O
through O
you O
! O
I O
know O
exactly O
the O
kind O
of O
family O
conference O
that O
has O
been O
held O
about O
the O
Pendleton O
fireside O
. O
" O
Is O
n't O
it O
a O
pity O
that O
Sallie O
has O
n't O
amounted O
to O
more O
since O
she O
left O
college O
? O
She O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
something O
useful O
instead O
of O
frittering O
her O
time O
away O
in O
the O
petty O
social O
life O
of O
Worcester O
. O
Also O
[ O
Jervis O
speaks O
] O
she O
is O
getting O
interested O
in O
that O
confounded O
young O
Hallock O
, O
too O
good-looking O
and O
fascinating O
and O
erratic O
; O
I O
never O
did O
like O
politicians O
. O
We O
must O
deflect O
her O
mind O
with O
some O
uplifting O
and O
absorbing O
occupation O
until O
the O
danger O
is O
past O
. O
Ha O
! O
I O
have O
it O
! O
We O
will O
put O
her O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
John O
Grier O
Home O

" O
Oh O
, O
I O
can O
hear O
him O
as O
clearly O
as O
if O
I O
were O
there O
! O
On O
the O
occasion O
of O
my O
last O
visit O
in O
your O
delectable O
household O
Jervis O
and O
I O
had O
a O
very O
solemn O
conversation O
in O
regard O
to O
( O
1 O
) O
marriage O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
the O
low O
ideals O
of O
politicians O
, O
( O
3 O
) O
the O
frivolous O
, O
useless O
lives O
that O
society O
women O
lead O
. O
Please O
tell O
your O
moral O
husband O
that O
I O
took O
his O
words O
deeply O
to O
heart O
, O
and O
that O
ever O
since O
my O
return O
to O
Worcester O
I O
have O
been O
spending O
one O
afternoon O
a O
week O
reading O
poetry O
with O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O
Female O
Inebriate O
Asylum O
. O
My O
life O
is O
not O
so O
purposeless O
as O
it O
appears O
. O
Also O
let O
me O
assure O
you O
that O
the O
politician O
is O
not O
dangerously O
imminent O
; O
and O
that O
, O
anyway O
, O
he O
is O
a O
very O
desirable O
politician O
, O
even O
though O
his O
views O
on O
tariff O
and O
single O
tax O
and O
trade-unionism O
do O
not O
exactly O
coincide O
with O
Jervis O
's O
. O
Your O
desire O
to O
dedicate O
my O
life O
to O
the O
public O
good O
is O
very O
sweet O
, O
but O
you O
should O
look O
at O
it O
from O
the O
asylum O
's O
point O
of O
view O
. O
Have O
you O
no O
pity O
for O
those O
poor O
defenseless O
little O
orphan O
children O
? O
I O
have O
, O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
, O
and O
I O
respectfully O
decline O
the O
position O
which O
you O
offer O
. O
I O
shall O
be O
charmed O
, O
however O
, O
to O
accept O
your O
invitation O
to O
visit O
you O
in O
New O
York O
, O
though O
I O
must O
acknowledge O
that O
I O
am O
not O
very O
excited O
over O
the O
list O
of O
gaieties O
you O
have O
planned O
. O
Please O
substitute O
for O
the O
New O
York O
Orphanage O
and O
the O
Foundling O
Hospital O
a O
few O
theaters O
and O
operas O
and O
a O

two O
new O
evening O
gowns O

a O
blue O
and O
gold O
coat O
with O
a O
white O
fur O
collar O
. O
I O
dash O
to O
pack O
them O

so O
telegraph O
fast O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
wish O
to O
see O
me O
for O
myself O
alone O
, O
but O
only O
as O
a O
successor O
to O
Mrs. O
Lippett O

Your O
invitation O
is O
especially O
seasonable O

A O
charming O
young O
politician O
named O
Gordon O
Hallock O
is O

be O
in O
New O

THE O
JOHN O
GRIER O
HOME O
, O
February O
15 O
. O
Dear O
Judy O
: O
We O
arrived O
in O
a O
snowstorm O
at O
eleven O
last O
night O
, O
Singapore O
and O
Jane O
and O
I O
. O
It O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
customary O
for O
superintendents O
of O
orphan O
asylums O
to O
bring O
with O
them O
personal O
maids O
and O
Chinese O
chows O
. O
The O
night O
watchman O
and O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
had O
waited O
up O
to O
receive O
me O
, O
were O
thrown O
into O
an O
awful O
flutter O
. O
They O
had O
never O
seen O
the O
like O
of O
Sing O
, O
and O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
introducing O
a O
wolf O
into O
the O
fold O
. O
I O
reassured O
them O
as O
to O
his O
dogginess O
, O
and O
the O
watchman O
, O
after O
studying O
his O
black O
tongue O
, O
ventured O
a O
witticism O
. O
He O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
I O
fed O
him O
on O
huckleberry O
pie O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
find O
accommodations O
for O
my O
family O
. O
Poor O
Sing O
was O
dragged O
off O
whimpering O
to O
a O
strange O
woodshed O
, O
and O
given O
a O
piece O
of O
burlap O
. O
Jane O
did O
not O
fare O
much O
better O
. O
There O
was O
not O
an O
extra O
bed O
in O
the O
building O
, O
barring O
a O
five-foot O
crib O
in O
the O
hospital O
room O
. O
She O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
approaches O
six O
. O
We O
tucked O
her O
in O
, O
and O
she O
spent O
the O
night O
folded O
up O
like O
a O
jackknife O
. O
She O
has O
limped O
about O
today O
, O
looking O
like O
a O
decrepit O
letter O
S O
, O
openly O
deploring O
this O
latest O
escapade O
on O
the O
part O
of O
her O
flighty O
mistress O
, O
and O
longing O
for O
the O
time O
when O
we O
shall O
come O
to O
our O
senses O
, O
and O
return O
to O
the O
parental O
fireside O
in O
Worcester O
. O
I O
know O
that O
she O
is O
going O
to O
spoil O
all O
my O
chances O
of O
being O
popular O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
staff O
. O
Having O
her O
here O
is O
the O
silliest O
idea O
that O
was O
ever O
conceived O
, O
but O
you O
know O
my O
family O
. O
I O
fought O
their O
objections O
step O
by O
step O
, O
but O
they O
made O
their O
last O
stand O
on O
Jane O
. O
If O
I O
brought O
her O
along O
to O
see O
that O
I O
ate O
nourishing O
food O
and O
did O
n't O
stay O
up O
all O
night O
, O
I O
might O
come O
-- O
temporarily O
; O
but O
if O
I O
refused O
to O
bring O
her O
-- O
oh O
, O
dear O
me O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
was O
ever O
again O
to O
cross O
the O
threshold O
of O
Stone O
Gate O
! O
So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
very O
welcome O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
. O
I O
woke O
by O
a O
gong O
at O
six O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
lay O
for O
a O
time O
listening O
to O
the O
racket O
that O
twenty-five O
little O
girls O
made O
in O
the O
lavatory O
over O
my O
head O
. O
It O
appears O
that O
they O
do O
not O
get O
baths O
, O
-- O
just O
face-washes O
, O
-- O
but O
they O
make O
as O
much O
splashing O
as O
twenty-five O
puppies O
in O
a O
pool O
. O
I O
rose O
and O
dressed O
and O
explored O
a O
bit O
. O
You O
were O
wise O
in O
not O
having O
me O
come O
to O
look O
the O
place O
over O
before O
I O
engaged O
. O
While O
my O
little O
charges O
were O
at O
breakfast O
, O
it O
seemed O
a O
happy O
time O
to O
introduce O
myself O
; O
so O
I O
sought O
the O
dining O
room O
. O
Horror O
piled O
on O
horror O
-- O
those O
bare O
drab O
walls O
and O
oil-cloth-covered O
tables O
with O
tin O
cups O
and O
plates O
and O
wooden O
benches O
, O
and O
, O
by O
way O
of O
decoration O
, O
that O
one O
illuminated O
text O
, O
" O
The O
Lord O
Will O
Provide O
" O
! O
The O
trustee O
who O
added O
that O
last O
touch O
must O
possess O
a O
grim O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O
Really O
, O
Judy O
, O
I O
never O
knew O
there O
was O
any O
spot O
in O
the O
world O
so O
entirely O
ugly O
; O
and O
when O
I O
saw O
those O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
pale O
, O
listless O
, O
blue-uniformed O
children O
, O
the O
whole O
dismal O
business O
suddenly O
struck O
me O
with O
such O
a O
shock O
that O
I O
almost O
collapsed O
. O
It O
seemed O
like O
an O
unachievable O
goal O
for O
one O
person O
to O
bring O
sunshine O
to O
one O
hundred O
little O
faces O
when O
what O
they O
need O
is O
a O
mother O
apiece O
. O
I O
plunged O
into O
this O
thing O
lightly O
enough O
, O
partly O
because O
you O
were O
too O
persuasive O
, O
and O
mostly O
, O
I O
honestly O
think O
, O
because O
that O
scurrilous O
Gordon O
Hallock O
laughed O
so O
uproariously O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
my O
being O
able O
to O
manage O
an O
asylum O
. O
Between O
you O
all O
you O
hypnotized O
me O
. O
And O
then O
of O
course O
, O
after O
I O
began O
reading O
up O
on O
the O
subject O
and O
visiting O
all O
those O
seventeen O
institutions O
, O
I O
got O
excited O
over O
orphans O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
put O
my O
own O
ideas O
into O
practice O
. O
But O
now O
I O
'm O
aghast O
at O
finding O
myself O
here O
; O
it O
's O
such O
a O
stupendous O
undertaking O
. O
The O
future O
health O
and O
happiness O
of O
a O
hundred O
human O
beings O
lie O
in O
my O
hands O
, O
to O
say O
nothing O
of O
their O
three O
or O
four O
hundred O
children O
and O
thousand O
grandchildren O
. O
The O
thing O
's O
geometrically O
progressive O
. O
It O
's O
awful O
. O
Who O
am O
I O
to O
undertake O
this O
job O
? O
Look O
, O
oh O
, O
look O
for O
another O
superintendent O
! O
Jane O
says O
dinner O
's O
ready O
. O
Having O
eaten O
two O
of O
your O
institution O
meals O
, O
the O
thought O
of O
another O
does O
n't O
excite O
me O
. O
LATER O
. O
The O
staff O
had O
mutton O
hash O
and O
spinach O
, O
with O
tapioca O
pudding O
for O
dessert O
. O
What O
the O
children O
had O
I O
hate O
to O
consider O
. O
I O
started O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
my O
first O
official O
speech O
at O
breakfast O
this O
morning O
. O
It O
dealt O
with O
all O
the O
wonderful O
new O
changes O
that O
are O
to O
come O
to O
the O
John O
Grier O
Home O
through O
the O
generosity O
of O
Mr. O
Jervis O
Pendleton O
, O
the O
president O
of O
our O
board O
of O
trustees O
, O
and O
of O
Mrs. O
Pendleton O
, O
the O
dear O
" O
Aunt O
Judy O
" O
of O
every O
little O
boy O
and O
girl O
here O
. O
Please O
do O
n't O
object O
to O
my O
featuring O
the O
Pendleton O
family O
so O
prominently O
. O
I O
did O
it O
for O
political O
reasons O
. O
As O
the O
entire O
working O
staff O
of O
the O
institution O
was O
present O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
opportunity O
to O
emphasize O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
of O
these O
upsetting O
, O
innovations O
come O
straight O
from O
headquarters O
, O
and O
not O
out O
of O
my O
excitable O
brain O
. O
The O
children O
stopped O
eating O
and O
stared O
. O
The O
conspicuous O
color O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
frivolous O
tilt O
of O
my O
nose O
are O
evidently O
new O
attributes O
in O
a O
superintendent O
. O
My O
colleagues O
also O
showed O
plainly O
that O
they O
consider O
me O
too O
young O
and O
too O
inexperienced O
to O
be O
set O
in O
authority O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
Jervis O
's O
wonderful O
Scotch O
doctor O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
he O
will O
have O
to O
be O
VERY O
wonderful O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
these O
people O
, O
especially O
the O
kindergarten O
teacher O
. O
Miss O
Snaith O
and O
I O
clashed O
early O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
fresh O
air O
; O
but O
I O
intend O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
this O
dreadful O
institution O
smell O
, O
if O
I O
freeze O
every O
child O
into O
a O
little O
ice O
statue O
. O
This O
being O
a O
sunny O
, O
sparkling O
, O
snowy O
afternoon O
, O
I O
ordered O
that O
dungeon O
of O
a O
playroom O
closed O
and O
the O
children O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
" O
She O
's O
chasin O
' O
us O
out O
, O
" O
I O
heard O
one O
small O
urchin O
grumbling O
as O
he O
struggled O
into O
a O
two-years-too-small O
overcoat O
. O
They O
simply O
stood O
about O
the O
yard O
, O
all O
humped O
in O
their O
clothes O
, O
waiting O
patiently O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
back O
in O
. O
No O
running O
or O
shouting O
or O
coasting O
or O
snowballs O
. O
Think O
of O
it O
! O
These O
children O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
play O
. O
STILL O
LATER O
. O
I O
have O
already O
begun O
the O
congenial O
task O
of O
spending O
your O
money O
. O
I O
bought O
eleven O
hot-water O
bottles O
this O
afternoon O
( O
every O
one O
that O
the O
village O
drug O
store O
contained O
) O
likewise O
some O
woolen O
blankets O
and O
padded O
quilts O
. O
And O
the O
windows O
are O
wide O
open O
in O
the O
babies O
' O
dormitory O
. O
Those O
poor O
little O
tots O
are O
going O
to O
enjoy O
the O
perfectly O
new O
sensation O
of O
being O
able O
to O
breathe O
at O
night O
. O
There O
are O
a O
million O
things O
I O
want O
to O
grumble O
about O
, O
but O
it O
's O
half-past O
ten O
, O
and O
Jane O
says O
I O
MUST O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
Yours O
in O
command O
, O
SALLIE O
McBRIDE O
. O
P.S. O
Before O
turning O
in O
, O
I O
tiptoed O
through O
the O
corridor O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
all O
was O
right O
, O
and O
what O
do O
you O
think O
I O
found O
? O
Miss O
Snaith O
softly O
closing O
the O
windows O
in O
the O
babies O
' O
dormitory O
! O
Just O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
find O
a O
suitable O
position O
for O
her O
in O
an O
old O

home O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
discharge O

CHAPTER O

Loomings O
Call O
me PRON_PER
Ishmael PROP_PER
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
-- O
never O
mind O
how O
long O
precisely O
-- O
having O
little O
or O
no O
money O
in O
my PRON_PER
purse O
, O
and O
nothing O
particular O
to O
interest O
me PRON_PER
on O
shore O
, O
I PRON_PER
thought O
I PRON_PER
would O
sail O
about O
a O
little O
and O
see O
the O
watery O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O
It O
is O
a O
way O
I PRON_PER
have O
of O
driving O
off O
the O
spleen O
and O
regulating O
the O
circulation O
. O
Whenever O
I PRON_PER
find O
myself PRON_PER
growing O
grim O
about O
the O
mouth O
; O
whenever O
it O
is O
a O
damp O
, O
drizzly O
November O
in O
my NOM_PER
soul NOM_PER
; O
whenever O
I O
find O
myself O
involuntarily O
pausing O
before O
coffin O
warehouses O
, O
and O
bringing O
up O
the O
rear O
of O
every O
funeral O
I O
meet O
; O
and O
especially O
whenever O
my O
hypos O
get O
such O
an O
upper O
hand O
of O
me O
, O
that O
it O
requires O
a O
strong O
moral O
principle O
to O
prevent O
me O
from O
deliberately O
stepping O
into O
the O
street O
, O
and O
methodically O
knocking O
people O
's O
hats O
off O
-- O
then O
, O
I O
account O
it O
high O
time O
to O
get O
to O
sea O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
. O
This O
is O
my O
substitute O
for O
pistol O
and O
ball O
. O
With O
a O
philosophical O
flourish O
Cato O
throws O
himself O
upon O
his O
sword O
; O
I O
quietly O
take O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
surprising O
in O
this O
. O
If O
they O
but O
knew O
it O
, O
almost O
all O
men O
in O
their O
degree O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
cherish O
very O
nearly O
the O
same O
feelings O
towards O
the O
ocean O
with O
me O
. O
There O
now O
is O
your O
insular O
city O
of O
the O
Manhattoes O
, O
belted O
round O
by O
wharves O
as O
Indian O
isles O
by O
coral O
reefs O
-- O
commerce O
surrounds O
it O
with O
her O
surf O
. O
Right O
and O
left O
, O
the O
streets O
take O
you O
waterward O
. O
Its O
extreme O
downtown O
is O
the O
battery O
, O
where O
that O
noble O
mole O
is O
washed O
by O
waves O
, O
and O
cooled O
by O
breezes O
, O
which O
a O
few O
hours O
previous O
were O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
. O
Look O
at O
the O
crowds O
of O
water-gazers O
there O
. O
Circumambulate O
the O
city O
of O
a O
dreamy O
Sabbath O
afternoon O
. O
Go O
from O
Corlears O
Hook O
to O
Coenties O
Slip O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
, O
by O
Whitehall O
, O
northward O
. O
What O
do O
you O
see O
? O
-- O
Posted O
like O
silent O
sentinels O
all O
around O
the O
town O
, O
stand O
thousands O
upon O
thousands O
of O
mortal O
men O
fixed O
in O
ocean O
reveries O
. O
Some O
leaning O
against O
the O
spiles O
; O
some O
seated O
upon O
the O
pier-heads O
; O
some O
looking O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
glasses O
! O
of O
ships O
from O
China O
; O
some O
high O
aloft O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
as O
if O
striving O
to O
get O
a O
still O
better O
seaward O
peep O
. O
But O
these O
are O
all O
landsmen O
; O
of O
week O
days O
pent O
up O
in O
lath O
and O
plaster O
-- O
tied O
to O
counters O
, O
nailed O
to O
benches O
, O
clinched O
to O
desks O
. O
How O
then O
is O
this O
? O
Are O
the O
green O
fields O
gone O
? O
What O
do O
they O
here O
? O
But O
look O
! O
here O
come O
more O
crowds O
, O
pacing O
straight O
for O
the O
water O
, O
and O
seemingly O
bound O
for O
a O
dive O
. O
Strange O
! O
Nothing O
will O
content O
them O
but O
the O
extremest O
limit O
of O
the O
land O
; O
loitering O
under O
the O
shady O
lee O
of O
yonder O
warehouses O
will O
not O
suffice O
. O
No O
. O
They O
must O
get O
just O
as O
nigh O
the O
water O
as O
they O
possibly O
can O
without O
falling O
in O
. O
And O
there O
they O
stand O
-- O
miles O
of O
them O
-- O
leagues O
. O
Inlanders O
all O
, O
they O
come O
from O
lanes O
and O
alleys O
, O
streets O
and O
avenues O
, O
-- O
north O
, O
east O
, O
south O
, O
and O
west O
. O
Yet O
here O
they O
all O
unite O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
does O
the O
magnetic O
virtue O
of O
the O
needles O
of O
the O
compasses O
of O
all O
those O
ships O
attract O
them O
thither O
? O
Once O
more O
. O
Say O
you O
are O
in O
the O
country O
; O
in O
some O
high O
land O
of O
lakes O
. O
Take O
almost O
any O
path O
you O
please O
, O
and O
ten O
to O
one O
it O
carries O
you O
down O
in O
a O
dale O
, O
and O
leaves O
you O
there O
by O
a O
pool O
in O
the O
stream O
. O
There O
is O
magic O
in O
it O
. O
Let O
the O
most O
absent-minded O
of O
men O
be O
plunged O
in O
his O
deepest O
reveries O
-- O
stand O
that O
man O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
set O
his O
feet O
a-going O
, O
and O
he O
will O
infallibly O
lead O
you O
to O
water O
, O
if O
water O
there O
be O
in O
all O
that O
region O
. O
Should O
you O
ever O
be O
athirst O
in O
the O
great O
American O
desert O
, O
try O
this O
experiment O
, O
if O
your O
caravan O
happen O
to O
be O
supplied O
with O
a O
metaphysical O
professor O
. O
Yes O
, O
as O
every O
one O
knows O
, O
meditation O
and O
water O
are O
wedded O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
here O
is O
an O
artist O
. O
He O
desires O
to O
paint O
you O
the O
dreamiest O
, O
shadiest O
, O
quietest O
, O
most O
enchanting O
bit O
of O
romantic O
landscape O
in O
all O
the O
valley O
of O
the O
Saco O
. O
What O
is O
the O
chief O
element O
he O
employs O
? O
There O
stand O
his O
trees O
, O
each O
with O
a O
hollow O
trunk O
, O
as O
if O
a O
hermit O
and O
a O
crucifix O
were O
within O
; O
and O
here O
sleeps O
his O
meadow O
, O
and O
there O
sleep O
his O
cattle O
; O
and O
up O
from O
yonder O
cottage O
goes O
a O
sleepy O
smoke O
. O
Deep O
into O
distant O
woodlands O
winds O
a O
mazy O
way O
, O
reaching O
to O
overlapping O
spurs O
of O
mountains O
bathed O
in O
their O
hill-side O
blue O
. O
But O
though O
the O
picture O
lies O
thus O
tranced O
, O
and O
though O
this O
pine-tree O
shakes O
down O
its O
sighs O
like O
leaves O
upon O
this O
shepherd O
's O
head O
, O
yet O
all O
were O
vain O
, O
unless O
the O
shepherd O
's O
eye O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
magic O
stream O
before O
him O
. O
Go O
visit O
the O
Prairies O
in O
June O
, O
when O
for O
scores O
on O
scores O
of O
miles O
you O
wade O
knee-deep O
among O
Tiger-lilies O
-- O
what O
is O
the O
one O
charm O
wanting O
? O
-- O
Water O
there O
is O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
there O
! O
Were O
Niagara O
but O
a O
cataract O
of O
sand O
, O
would O
you O
travel O
your O
thousand O
miles O
to O
see O
it O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
poor O
poet O
of O
Tennessee O
, O
upon O
suddenly O
receiving O
two O
handfuls O
of O
silver O
, O
deliberate O
whether O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
coat O
, O
which O
he O
sadly O
needed O
, O
or O
invest O
his O
money O
in O
a O
pedestrian O
trip O
to O
Rockaway O
Beach O
? O
Why O
is O
almost O
every O
robust O
healthy O
boy O
with O
a O
robust O
healthy O
soul O
in O
him O
, O
at O
some O
time O
or O
other O
crazy O
to O
go O
to O
sea O
? O
Why O
upon O
your O
first O
voyage O
as O
a O
passenger O
, O
did O
you O
yourself O
feel O
such O
a O
mystical O
vibration O
, O
when O
first O
told O
that O
you O
and O
your O
ship O
were O
now O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
old O
Persians O
hold O
the O
sea O
holy O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
Greeks O
give O
it O
a O
separate O
deity O
, O
and O
own O
brother O
of O
Jove O
? O
Surely O
all O
this O
is O
not O
without O
meaning O
. O
And O
still O
deeper O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
story O
of O
Narcissus O
, O
who O
because O
he O
could O
not O
grasp O
the O
tormenting O
, O
mild O
image O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
fountain O
, O
plunged O
into O
it O
and O
was O
drowned O
. O
But O
that O
same O
image O
, O
we O
ourselves O
see O
in O
all O
rivers O
and O
oceans O
. O
It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
the O
ungraspable O
phantom O
of O
life O
; O
and O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
it O
all O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
going O
to O
sea O
whenever O
I O
begin O
to O
grow O
hazy O
about O
the O
eyes O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
be O
over O
conscious O
of O
my O
lungs O
, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
have O
it O
inferred O
that O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
passenger O
. O
For O
to O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
you O
must O
needs O
have O
a O
purse O
, O
and O
a O
purse O
is O
but O
a O
rag O
unless O
you O
have O
something O
in O
it O
. O
Besides O
, O
passengers O
get O
sea-sick O
-- O
grow O
quarrelsome O
-- O
do O
n't O
sleep O
of O
nights O
-- O
do O
not O
enjoy O
themselves O
much O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
; O
-- O
no O
, O
I O
never O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
; O
nor O
, O
though O
I O
am O
something O
of O
a O
salt O
, O
do O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
Commodore O
, O
or O
a O
Captain O
, O
or O
a O
Cook O
. O
I O
abandon O
the O
glory O
and O
distinction O
of O
such O
offices O
to O
those O
who O
like O
them O
. O
For O
my O
part O
, O
I O
abominate O
all O
honorable O
respectable O
toils O
, O
trials O
, O
and O
tribulations O
of O
every O
kind O
whatsoever O
. O
It O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
do O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
, O
without O
taking O
care O
of O
ships O
, O
barques O
, O
brigs O
, O
schooners O
, O
and O
what O
not O
. O
And O
as O
for O
going O
as O
cook O
, O
-- O
though O
I O
confess O
there O
is O
considerable O
glory O
in O
that O
, O
a O
cook O
being O
a O
sort O
of O
officer O
on O
ship-board O
-- O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
I O
never O
fancied O
broiling O
fowls O
; O
-- O
though O
once O
broiled O
, O
judiciously O
buttered O
, O
and O
judgmatically O
salted O
and O
peppered O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
will O
speak O
more O
respectfully O
, O
not O
to O
say O
reverentially O
, O
of O
a O
broiled O
fowl O
than O
I O
will O
. O
It O
is O
out O
of O
the O
idolatrous O
dotings O
of O
the O
old O
Egyptians O
upon O
broiled O
ibis O
and O
roasted O
river O
horse O
, O
that O
you O
see O
the O
mummies O
of O
those O
creatures O
in O
their O
huge O
bakehouses O
the O
pyramids O
. O
No O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
sea O
, O
I O
go O
as O
a O
simple O
sailor O
, O
right O
before O
the O
mast O
, O
plumb O
down O
into O
the O
fore-castle O
, O
aloft O
there O
to O
the O
royal O
mast-head O
. O
True O
, O
they O
rather O
order O
me O
about O
some O
, O
and O
make O
me O
jump O
from O
spar O
to O
spar O
, O
like O
a O
grasshopper O
in O
a O
May O
meadow O
. O
And O
at O
first O
, O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
unpleasant O
enough O
. O
It O
touches O
one O
's O
sense O
of O
honor O
, O
particularly O
if O
you O
come O
of O
an O
old O
established O
family O
in O
the O
land O
, O
the O
Van O
Rensselaers O
, O
or O
Randolphs O
, O
or O
Hardicanutes O
. O
And O
more O
than O
all O
, O
if O
just O
previous O
to O
putting O
your O
hand O
into O
the O
tar-pot O
, O
you O
have O
been O
lording O
it O
as O
a O
country O
schoolmaster O
, O
making O
the O
tallest O
boys O
stand O
in O
awe O
of O
you O
. O
The O
transition O
is O
a O
keen O
one O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
from O
a O
schoolmaster O
to O
a O
sailor O
, O
and O
requires O
a O
strong O
decoction O
of O
Seneca O
and O
the O
Stoics O
to O
enable O
you O
to O
grin O
and O
bear O
it O
. O
But O
even O
this O
wears O
off O
in O
time O
. O
What O
of O
it O
, O
if O
some O
old O
hunks O
of O
a O
sea-captain O
orders O
me O
to O
get O
a O
broom O
and O
sweep O
down O
the O
decks O
? O
What O
does O
that O
indignity O
amount O
to O
, O
weighed O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
in O
the O
scales O
of O
the O
New O
Testament O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
the O
archangel O
Gabriel O
thinks O
anything O
the O
less O
of O
me O
, O
because O
I O
promptly O
and O
respectfully O
obey O
that O
old O
hunks O
in O
that O
particular O
instance O
? O
Who O
ai O
n't O
a O
slave O
? O
Tell O
me O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
however O
the O
old O
sea-captains O
may O
order O
me O
about O
-- O
however O
they O
may O
thump O
and O
punch O
me O
about O
, O
I O
have O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
knowing O
that O
it O
is O
all O
right O
; O
that O
everybody O
else O
is O
one O
way O
or O
other O
served O
in O
much O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
either O
in O
a O
physical O
or O
metaphysical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
that O
is O
; O
and O
so O
the O
universal O
thump O
is O
passed O
round O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
should O
rub O
each O
other O
's O
shoulder-blades O
, O
and O
be O
content O
. O
Again O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
they O
make O
a O
point O
of O
paying O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
, O
whereas O
they O
never O
pay O
passengers O
a O
single O
penny O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
passengers O
themselves O
must O
pay O
. O
And O
there O
is O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
world O
between O
paying O
and O
being O
paid O
. O
The O
act O
of O
paying O
is O
perhaps O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
infliction O
that O
the O
two O
orchard O
thieves O
entailed O
upon O
us O
. O
But O
being O
paid O
, O
-- O
what O
will O
compare O
with O
it O
? O
The O
urbane O
activity O
with O
which O
a O
man O
receives O
money O
is O
really O
marvellous O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
so O
earnestly O
believe O
money O
to O
be O
the O
root O
of O
all O
earthly O
ills O
, O
and O
that O
on O
no O
account O
can O
a O
monied O
man O
enter O
heaven O
. O
Ah O
! O
how O
cheerfully O
we O
consign O
ourselves O
to O
perdition O
! O
Finally O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
of O
the O
wholesome O
exercise O
and O
pure O
air O
of O
the O
fore-castle O
deck O
. O
For O
as O
in O
this O
world O
, O
head O
winds O
are O
far O
more O
prevalent O
than O
winds O
from O
astern O
( O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
never O
violate O
the O
Pythagorean O
maxim O
) O
, O
so O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
Commodore O
on O
the O
quarter-deck O
gets O
his O
atmosphere O
at O
second O
hand O
from O
the O
sailors O
on O
the O
forecastle O
. O
He O
thinks O
he O
breathes O
it O
first O
; O
but O
not O
so O
. O
In O
much O
the O
same O
way O
do O
the O
commonalty O
lead O
their O
leaders O
in O
many O
other O
things O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
leaders O
little O
suspect O
it O
. O
But O
wherefore O
it O
was O
that O
after O
having O
repeatedly O
smelt O
the O
sea O
as O
a O
merchant O
sailor O
, O
I O
should O
now O
take O
it O
into O
my O
head O
to O
go O
on O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
; O
this O
the O
invisible O
police O
officer O
of O
the O
Fates O
, O
who O
has O
the O
constant O
surveillance O
of O
me O
, O
and O
secretly O
dogs O
me O
, O
and O
influences O
me O
in O
some O
unaccountable O
way O
-- O
he O
can O
better O
answer O
than O
any O
one O
else O
. O
And O
, O
doubtless O
, O
my O
going O
on O
this O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
formed O
part O
of O
the O
grand O
programme O
of O
Providence O
that O
was O
drawn O
up O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
It O
came O
in O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
brief O
interlude O
and O
solo O
between O
more O
extensive O
performances O
. O
I O
take O
it O
that O
this O
part O
of O
the O
bill O
must O
have O
run O
something O
like O
this O
: O

PART O
I O
. O
The O
Wild O
Land O
I O
One O
January O
day O
, O
thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
little O
town O
of O
Hanover O
, O
anchored O
on O
a O
windy O
Nebraska O
tableland O
, O
was O
trying O
not O
to O
be O
blown O
away O
. O
A O
mist O
of O
fine O
snowflakes O
was O
curling O
and O
eddying O
about O
the O
cluster O
of O
low O
drab O
buildings O
huddled O
on O
the O
gray O
prairie O
, O
under O
a O
gray O
sky O
. O
The O
dwelling-houses O
were O
set O
about O
haphazard O
on O
the O
tough O
prairie O
sod O
; O
some O
of O
them O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
moved O
in O
overnight O
, O
and O
others O
as O
if O
they O
were O
straying O
off O
by O
themselves O
, O
headed O
straight O
for O
the O
open O
plain O
. O
None O
of O
them O
had O
any O
appearance O
of O
permanence O
, O
and O
the O
howling O
wind O
blew O
under O
them O
as O
well O
as O
over O
them O
. O
The O
main O
street O
was O
a O
deeply O
rutted O
road O
, O
now O
frozen O
hard O
, O
which O
ran O
from O
the O
squat O
red O
railway O
station O
and O
the O
grain O
" O
elevator O
" O
at O
the O
north O
end O
of O
the O
town O
to O
the O
lumber O
yard O
and O
the O
horse O
pond O
at O
the O
south O
end O
. O
On O
either O
side O
of O
this O
road O
straggled O
two O
uneven O
rows O
of O
wooden O
buildings O
; O
the O
general O
merchandise O
stores O
, O
the O
two O
banks O
, O
the O
drug O
store O
, O
the O
feed O
store O
, O
the O
saloon O
, O
the O
post-office O
. O
The O
board O
sidewalks O
were O
gray O
with O
trampled O
snow O
, O
but O
at O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
the NOM_PER
shopkeepers NOM_PER
, O
having O
come O
back O
from O
dinner O
, O
were O
keeping O
well O
behind O
their PRON_PER
frosty O
windows O
. O
The NOM_PER
children NOM_PER
were O
all O
in O
school O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nobody NOM_PER
abroad O
in O
the O
streets O
but O
a NOM_PER
few NOM_PER
rough-looking NOM_PER
countrymen NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
coarse NOM_PER
overcoats NOM_PER
, O
with O
their PRON_PER
long O
caps O
pulled O
down O
to O
their PRON_PER
noses O
. O
Some NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
them NOM_PER
had O
brought O
their O
wives O
to O
town O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
a O
red O
or O
a O
plaid O
shawl O
flashed O
out O
of O
one O
store O
into O
the O
shelter O
of O
another O
. O
At O
the O
hitch-bars O
along O
the O
street O
a O
few O
heavy O
work-horses O
, O
harnessed O
to O
farm O
wagons O
, O
shivered O
under O
their O
blankets O
. O
About O
the O
station O
everything O
was O
quiet O
, O
for O
there O
would O
not O
be O
another O
train O
in O
until O
night O
. O
On O
the O
sidewalk O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
stores O
sat O
a O
little O
Swede O
boy O
, O
crying O
bitterly O
. O
He O
was O
about O
five O
years O
old O
. O
His O
black O
cloth O
coat O
was O
much O
too O
big O
for O
him O
and O
made O
him O
look O
like O
a O
little O
old O
man O
. O
His O
shrunken O
brown O
flannel O
dress O
had O
been O
washed O
many O
times O
and O
left O
a O
long O
stretch O
of O
stocking O
between O
the O
hem O
of O
his O
skirt O
and O
the O
tops O
of O
his O
clumsy O
, O
copper-toed O
shoes O
. O
His O
cap O
was O
pulled O
down O
over O
his O
ears O
; O
his O
nose O
and O
his O
chubby O
cheeks O
were O
chapped O
and O
red O
with O
cold O
. O
He O
cried O
quietly O
, O
and O
the O
few O
people O
who O
hurried O
by O
did O
not O
notice O
him O
. O
He O
was O
afraid O
to O
stop O
any O
one O
, O
afraid O
to O
go O
into O
the O
store O
and O
ask O
for O
help O
, O
so O
he O
sat O
wringing O
his O
long O
sleeves O
and O
looking O
up O
a O
telegraph O
pole O
beside O
him O
, O
whimpering O
, O
" O
My O
kitten O
, O
oh O
, O
my O
kitten O
! O
Her O
will O
fweeze O
! O
" O
At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
pole O
crouched O
a O
shivering O
gray O
kitten O
, O
mewing O
faintly O
and O
clinging O
desperately O
to O
the O
wood O
with O
her O
claws O
. O
The O
boy O
had O
been O
left O
at O
the O
store O
while O
his O
sister O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
's O
office O
, O
and O
in O
her O
absence O
a O
dog O
had O
chased O
his O
kitten O
up O
the O
pole O
. O
The O
little O
creature O
had O
never O
been O
so O
high O
before O
, O
and O
she O
was O
too O
frightened O
to O
move O
. O
Her O
master O
was O
sunk O
in O
despair O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
country O
boy O
, O
and O
this O
village O
was O
to O
him O
a O
very O
strange O
and O
perplexing O
place O
, O
where O
people O
wore O
fine O
clothes O
and O
had O
hard O
hearts O
. O
He O
always O
felt O
shy O
and O
awkward O
here O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
hide O
behind O
things O
for O
fear O
some O
one O
might O
laugh O
at O
him O
. O
Just O
now O
, O
he O
was O
too O
unhappy O
to O
care O
who O
laughed O
. O
At O
last O
he O
seemed O
to O
see O
a O
ray O
of O
hope O
: O
his O
sister O
was O
coming O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
ran O
toward O
her O
in O
his O
heavy O
shoes O
. O
His O
sister O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
strong O
girl O
, O
and O
she O
walked O
rapidly O
and O
resolutely O
, O
as O
if O
she O
knew O
exactly O
where O
she O
was O
going O
and O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
do O
next O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
man O
's O
long O
ulster O
( O
not O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
affliction O
, O
but O
as O
if O
it O
were O
very O
comfortable O
and O
belonged O
to O
her O
; O
carried O
it O
like O
a O
young O
soldier O
) O
, O
and O
a O
round O
plush O
cap O
, O
tied O
down O
with O
a O
thick O
veil O
. O
She O
had O
a O
serious O
, O
thoughtful O
face O
, O
and O
her O
clear O
, O
deep O
blue O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
intently O
on O
the O
distance O
, O
without O
seeming O
to O
see O
anything O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
in O
trouble O
. O
She O
did O
not O
notice O
the O
little O
boy O
until O
he O
pulled O
her O
by O
the O
coat O
. O
Then O
she O
stopped O
short O
and O
stooped O
down O
to O
wipe O
his O
wet O
face O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
Emil O
! O
I O
told O
you O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
store O
and O
not O
to O
come O
out O
. O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
? O
" O
" O
My O
kitten O
, O
sister O
, O
my O
kitten O
! O
A O
man O
put O
her O
out O
, O
and O
a O
dog O
chased O
her O
up O
there O
. O
" O
His O
forefinger O
, O
projecting O
from O
the O
sleeve O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
pointed O
up O
to O
the O
wretched O
little O
creature O
on O
the O
pole O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Emil O
! O
Did O
n't O
I O
tell O
you O
she O
'd O
get O
us O
into O
trouble O
of O
some O
kind O
, O
if O
you O
brought O
her O
? O
What O
made O
you O
tease O
me O
so O
? O
But O
there O
, O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
better O
myself O
. O
" O
She O
went O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
pole O
and O
held O
out O
her O
arms O
, O
crying O
, O
" O
Kitty O
, O
kitty O
, O
kitty O
, O
" O
but O
the O
kitten O
only O
mewed O
and O
faintly O
waved O
its O
tail O
. O
Alexandra O
turned O
away O
decidedly O
. O
" O
No O
, O
she O
wo O
n't O
come O
down O
. O
Somebody O
will O
have O
to O
go O
up O
after O
her O

I O
saw O
the O

wagon O
in O

I O
'll O
go O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
find O
Carl O

Maybe O
he O
can O
do O
something O
. O
Only O
you O
must O
stop O
crying O
, O
or O
I O
wo O

go O
a O
step O

Where O

store O

Never O
mind O

Hold O
still O
, O
till O
I O
put O
this O
on O
you O
. O
" O
She O
unwound O
the O
brown O
veil O
from O
her O
head O
and O
tied O
it O
about O
his O
throat O
. O
A O
shabby O
little O
traveling O
man O
, O
who O
was O
just O
then O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
store O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
saloon O
, O
stopped O
and O
gazed O
stupidly O
at O
the O
shining O
mass O
of O
hair O
she O
bared O
when O
she O
took O
off O
her O
veil O
; O
two O
thick O
braids O
, O
pinned O
about O
her O
head O
in O
the O
German O
way O
, O
with O
a O
fringe O
of O
reddish-yellow O
curls O
blowing O
out O
from O
under O
her O
cap O
. O
He O
took O
his O
cigar O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
held O
the O
wet O
end O
between O
the O
fingers O
of O
his O
woolen O
glove O
. O
" O
My O
God O
, O
girl O
, O
what O
a O
head O
of O
hair O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
quite O
innocently O
and O
foolishly O
. O
She O
stabbed O
him O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
Amazonian O
fierceness O
and O
drew O
in O
her O
lower O
lip O
-- O
most O
unnecessary O
severity O
. O
It O
gave O
the O
little O
clothing O
drummer O
such O
a O
start O
that O
he O
actually O
let O
his O
cigar O
fall O
to O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
went O
off O
weakly O
in O
the O
teeth O
of O
the O
wind O
to O
the O
saloon O
. O
His O
hand O
was O
still O
unsteady O
when O
he O
took O
his O
glass O
from O
the O
bartender O
. O
His O
feeble O
flirtatious O
instincts O
had O
been O
crushed O
before O
, O
but O
never O
so O
mercilessly O
. O
He O
felt O
cheap O
and O
ill-used O
, O
as O
if O
some O
one O
had O
taken O
advantage O
of O
him O
. O
When O
a O
drummer O
had O
been O
knocking O
about O
in O
little O
drab O
towns O
and O
crawling O
across O
the O
wintry O
country O
in O
dirty O
smoking-cars O
, O
was O
he O
to O
be O
blamed O
if O
, O
when O
he O
chanced O
upon O
a O
fine O
human O
creature O
, O
he O
suddenly O
wished O
himself O
more O
of O
a O
man O
? O
While O
the O
little O
drummer O
was O
drinking O
to O
recover O
his O
nerve O
, O
Alexandra O
hurried O
to O
the O
drug O
store O
as O
the O
most O
likely O
place O
to O
find O
Carl O
Linstrum O
. O
There O
he O
was O
, O
turning O
over O
a O
portfolio O
of O
chromo O
" O
studies O
" O
which O
the O
druggist O
sold O
to O
the O
Hanover O
women O
who O
did O
china-painting O
. O
Alexandra O
explained O
her O
predicament O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
followed O
her O
to O
the O
corner O
, O
where O
Emil O
still O
sat O
by O
the O
pole O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
go O
up O
after O
her O
, O
Alexandra O
. O
I O
think O
at O
the O
depot O
they O
have O
some O
spikes O
I O
can O
strap O
on O
my O
feet O
. O
Wait O
a O
minute O
. O
" O
Carl O
thrust O
his O
hands O
into O
his O
pockets O
, O
lowered O
his O
head O
, O
and O
darted O
up O
the O
street O
against O
the O
north O
wind O
. O
He O
was O
a O
tall O
boy O
of O
fifteen O
, O
slight O
and O
narrow-chested O
. O
When O
he O
came O
back O
with O
the O
spikes O
, O
Alexandra O
asked O
him O
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
his O
overcoat O
. O
" O
I O
left O
it O
in O
the O
drug O
store O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
climb O
in O
it O
, O
anyhow O
. O
Catch O
me O
if O
I O
fall O
, O
Emil O
, O
" O
he O
called O
back O
as O
he O
began O
his O
ascent O
. O
Alexandra O
watched O
him O
anxiously O
; O
the O
cold O
was O
bitter O
enough O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
The O
kitten O
would O
not O
budge O
an O
inch O
. O
Carl O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
pole O
, O
and O
then O
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
tearing O
her O
from O
her O
hold O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
the O
ground O
, O
he O
handed O
the O
cat O
to O
her O
tearful O
little O
master O
. O
" O
Now O
go O
into O
the O
store O
with O
her O
, O
Emil O
, O
and O
get O
warm O
. O
" O
He O
opened O
the O
door O
for O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Wait O
a O
minute O
, O
Alexandra O
. O
Why O
ca O
n't O
I O
drive O
for O
you O
as O
far O
as O
our O
place O
? O
It O
's O
getting O
colder O
every O
minute O
. O
Have O
you O
seen O
the O
doctor O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
. O
He O
is O
coming O
over O
to-morrow O
. O
But O
he O
says O
father O
ca O
n't O
get O
better O
; O
ca O
n't O
get O
well O
. O
" O
The O
girl O
's O
lip O
trembled O
. O
She O
looked O
fixedly O
up O
the O
bleak O
street O
as O
if O
she O
were O
gathering O
her O
strength O
to O
face O
something O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
trying O
with O
all O
her O
might O
to O
grasp O
a O
situation O
which O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
painful O
, O
must O
be O
met O
and O
dealt O
with O
somehow O
. O
The O
wind O
flapped O
the O
skirts O
of O
her O
heavy O
coat O
about O
her O
. O
Carl O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
his O
sympathy O
. O
He O
, O
too O
, O
was O
lonely O
. O
He O
was O
a O
thin O
, O
frail O
boy O
, O
with O
brooding O
dark O
eyes O
, O
very O
quiet O
in O
all O
his O
movements O
. O
There O
was O
a O
delicate O
pallor O
in O
his O
thin O
face O
, O
and O
his O
mouth O
was O
too O
sensitive O
for O
a O
boy O
's O
. O
The O
lips O
had O
already O
a O
little O
curl O
of O
bitterness O
and O
skepticism O
. O
The O
two O
friends O
stood O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
on O
the O
windy O
street O
corner O
, O
not O
speaking O
a O
word O
, O
as O
two O
travelers O
, O
who O
have O
lost O
their O
way O
, O
sometimes O
stand O
and O
admit O
their O
perplexity O
in O
silence O
. O
When O
Carl O
turned O
away O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
'll O
see O
to O
your O
team O
. O
" O
Alexandra O
went O
into O
the O
store O
to O
have O
her O
purchases O
packed O
in O
the O
egg-boxes O
, O
and O
to O
get O
warm O
before O
she O
set O
out O
on O
her O
long O
cold O
drive O
. O
When O
she O
looked O
for O
Emil O
, O
she O
found O
him O
sitting O
on O
a O
step O
of O
the O
staircase O
that O
led O
up O
to O
the O
clothing O
and O
carpet O
department O
. O
He O
was O
playing O
with O
a O
little O
Bohemian O
girl O
, O
Marie O
Tovesky O
, O
who O
was O
tying O
her O
handkerchief O
over O
the O
kitten O
's O
head O
for O
a O
bonnet O
. O
Marie O
was O
a O
stranger O
in O
the O
country O
, O
having O
come O
from O
Omaha O
with O
her O
mother O
to O
visit O
her O
uncle O
, O
Joe O
Tovesky O
. O
She O
was O
a O
dark O
child O
, O
with O
brown O
curly O
hair O
, O
like O
a O
brunette O
doll O
's O
, O
a O
coaxing O
little O
red O
mouth O
, O
and O
round O
, O
yellow-brown O
eyes O
. O
Every O
one O
noticed O
her O
eyes O
; O
the O
brown O
iris O
had O
golden O
glints O
that O
made O
them O
look O
like O
gold-stone O
, O
or O
, O
in O
softer O
lights O
, O
like O
that O
Colorado O
mineral O
called O
tiger-eye O
. O

" O
no O

promised O
us PRON_PER
south O
rooms O
with O
a O
view O

together O
, O
instead O
of O
which O
here O
are O

Lucy PROP_PER

who O

’s O
unexpected O
accent O
. O
" O
It O
might O

" PRON_PER
She PRON_PER
looked O
at O
the O
two O
rows O
of O
English O
people O
who O
were O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
; O
at O
the O
row O
of O
white O
bottles O
of O
water O
and O
red O
bottles O
of O
wine O
that O
ran O
between O
the O
English O
people O
; O
at O
the O
portraits O
of O
the O
late O
Queen O
and O
the O
late O
Poet O
Laureate O
that O
hung O
behind O
the O
English O
people O
, O
heavily O
framed O
; O
at O
the O
notice O
of O
the O
English O
church O
( O
Rev. O

, O
that O
was O
the O
only O
other O
decoration O
of O
the O
wall O
. O
" O
Charlotte O
, O
do O
n’t O
you O
feel O
, O
too O
, O
that O
we O
might O
be O
in O
London O
? O
I O
can O
hardly O
believe O
that O
all O
kinds O
of O
other O
things O
are O
just O
outside O
. O
I O
suppose O
it O
is O
one O
’s O
being O
so O
tired O
. O
" O
" O
This O
meat O
has O
surely O
been O
used O
for O
soup O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
laying O
down O
her O
fork O
. O
" O
I O
want O
so O
to O
see O
the O
Arno O
. O
The O
rooms O
the O
Signora O
promised O
us O
in O
her O
letter O
would O
have O
looked O
over O
the O
Arno O
. O
The O
Signora O
had O
no O
business O
to O
do O
it O
at O
all O
. O
Oh O
, O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
! O
" O
" O
Any O
nook O
does O
for O
me O
, O
" O
Miss O
Bartlett O
continued O
; O
" O
but O
it O
does O
seem O
hard O
that O
you O
should O
n’t O
have O
a O
view O
. O
" O
Lucy O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
been O
selfish O
. O
" O
Charlotte O
, O
you O
must O
n’t O
spoil O
me O
: O
of O
course O
, O
you O
must O
look O
over O
the O
Arno O
, O
too O
. O
I O
meant O
that O
. O
The O
first O
vacant O
room O
in O
the O
front O
-- O
" O
" O
You O
must O
have O
it O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
part O
of O
whose O
travelling O
expenses O
were O
paid O
by O
Lucy O
’s O
mother O
-- O
a O
piece O
of O
generosity O
to O
which O
she O
made O
many O
a O
tactful O
allusion O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
. O
You O
must O
have O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
insist O
on O
it O
. O
Your O
mother O
would O
never O
forgive O
me O
, O
Lucy O
. O
" O
" O
She O
would O
never O
forgive O
me O
. O
" O
The O
ladies O
’ O
voices O
grew O
animated O
, O
and O
-- O
if O
the O
sad O
truth O
be O
owned O
-- O
a O
little O
peevish O
. O
They O
were O
tired O
, O
and O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
unselfishness O
they O
wrangled O
. O
Some O
of O
their O
neighbours O
interchanged O
glances O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
ill-bred O
people O
whom O
one O
does O
meet O
abroad O
-- O
leant O
forward O
over O
the O
table O
and O
actually O
intruded O
into O
their O
argument O
. O
He O
said O
: O
" O
I O
have O
a O
view O
, O
I O
have O
a O
view O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bartlett O
was O
startled O
. O
Generally O
at O
a O
pension O
people O
looked O
them O
over O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
speaking O
, O
and O
often O
did O
not O
find O
out O
that O
they O
would O
" O
do O
" O
till O
they O
had O
gone O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
the O
intruder O
was O
ill-bred O
, O
even O
before O
she O
glanced O
at O
him O
. O
He O
was O
an O
old O
man O
, O
of O
heavy O
build O
, O
with O
a O
fair O
, O
shaven O
face O
and O
large O
eyes O
. O
There O
was O
something O
childish O
in O
those O
eyes O
, O
though O
it O
was O
not O
the O
childishness O
of O
senility O
. O
What O
exactly O
it O
was O
Miss O
Bartlett O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
consider O
, O
for O
her O
glance O
passed O
on O
to O
his O
clothes O
. O
These O
did O
not O
attract O
her O
. O
He O
was O
probably O
trying O
to O
become O
acquainted O
with O
them O
before O
they O
got O
into O
the O
swim O
. O
So O
she O
assumed O
a O
dazed O
expression O
when O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
and O
then O
said O
: O
" O
A O
view O
? O
Oh O
, O
a O
view O
! O
How O
delightful O
a O
view O
is O
! O
" O
" O
This O
is O
my O
son O
, O
" O
said O
the O
old O
man O
; O
" O
his O
name O
’s O
George O
. O
He O
has O
a O
view O
too O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
repressing O
Lucy O
, O
who O
was O
about O
to O
speak O
. O
" O
What O
I O
mean O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
is O
that O
you O
can O
have O
our O
rooms O
, O
and O
we O
’ll O
have O
yours O
. O
We O
’ll O
change O
. O
" O
The O
better O
class O
of O
tourist O
was O
shocked O
at O
this O
, O
and O
sympathized O
with O
the O
new-comers O
. O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
in O
reply O
, O
opened O
her O
mouth O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
said O
" O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
indeed O
; O
that O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
said O
the O
old O
man O
, O
with O
both O
fists O
on O
the O
table O
. O
" O
Because O
it O
is O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
thank O
you O
. O
" O
" O
You O
see O
, O
we O
do O
n’t O
like O
to O
take O
-- O
" O
began O
Lucy O
. O
Her O
cousin O
again O
repressed O
her O
. O
" O
But O
why O
? O
" O
he O
persisted O
. O
" O
Women O
like O
looking O
at O
a O
view O
; O
men O
do O
n’t O
. O
" O
And O
he O
thumped O
with O
his O
fists O
like O
a O
naughty O
child O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
his O
son O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
George O
, O
persuade O
them O
! O
" O
" O
It O
’s O
so O
obvious O
they O
should O
have O
the O
rooms O
, O
" O
said O
the O
son O
. O
" O
There O
’s O
nothing O
else O
to O
say O
. O
" O
He O
did O
not O
look O
at O
the O
ladies O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
but O
his O
voice O
was O
perplexed O
and O
sorrowful O
. O
Lucy O
, O
too O
, O
was O
perplexed O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
in O
for O
what O
is O
known O
as O
" O
quite O
a O
scene O
, O
" O
and O
she O
had O
an O
odd O
feeling O
that O
whenever O
these O
ill-bred O
tourists O
spoke O
the O
contest O
widened O
and O
deepened O
till O
it O
dealt O
, O
not O
with O
rooms O
and O
views O
, O
but O
with O
-- O
well O
, O
with O
something O
quite O
different O
, O
whose O
existence O
she O
had O
not O
realized O
before O
. O
Now O
the O
old O
man O
attacked O
Miss O
Bartlett O
almost O
violently O
: O
Why O
should O
she O
not O
change O
? O
What O
possible O
objection O
had O
she O
? O
They O
would O
clear O
out O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
though O
skilled O
in O
the O
delicacies O
of O
conversation O
, O
was O
powerless O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
brutality O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
snub O
any O
one O
so O
gross O
. O
Her O
face O
reddened O
with O
displeasure O
. O
She O
looked O
around O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
all O
like O
this O
? O
" O
And O
two O
little O
old O
ladies O
, O
who O
were O
sitting O
further O
up O
the O
table O
, O
with O
shawls O
hanging O
over O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
chairs O
, O
looked O
back O
, O
clearly O
indicating O
" O
We O
are O
not O
; O
we O
are O
genteel O
. O
" O
" O
Eat O
your O
dinner O
, O
dear O
, O
" O
she O
said O
to O
Lucy O
, O
and O
began O
to O
toy O
again O
with O
the O
meat O
that O
she O
had O
once O
censured O
. O
Lucy O
mumbled O
that O
those O
seemed O
very O
odd O
people O
opposite O
. O
" O
Eat O
your O
dinner O
, O
dear O
. O
This O
pension O
is O
a O
failure O
. O
To-morrow O
we O
will O
make O
a O
change O
. O
" O
Hardly O
had O
she O
announced O
this O
fell O
decision O
when O
she O
reversed O
it O
. O
The O
curtains O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
room O
parted O
, O
and O
revealed O
a O
clergyman O
, O
stout O
but O
attractive O
, O
who O
hurried O
forward O
to O
take O
his O
place O
at O
the O
table O
, O
cheerfully O
apologizing O
for O
his O
lateness O
. O
Lucy O
, O
who O
had O
not O
yet O
acquired O
decency O
, O
at O
once O
rose O
to O
her O
feet O
, O
exclaiming O
: O
" O
Oh O
, O
oh O
! O
Why O
, O
it O
’s O
Mr. O
Beebe O
! O
Oh O
, O
how O
perfectly O
lovely O
! O
Oh O
, O
Charlotte O
, O
we O
must O
stop O
now O
, O
however O
bad O
the O
rooms O
are O
. O
Oh O
! O
" O
Miss O
Bartlett O
said O
, O
with O
more O
restraint O
: O
" O
How O
do O
you O
do O
, O
Mr. O
Beebe O
? O
I O
expect O
that O
you O
have O
forgotten O
us O
: O
Miss O
Bartlett O
and O
Miss O
Honeychurch O
, O
who O
were O
at O
Tunbridge O
Wells O
when O
you O
helped O
the O
Vicar O
of O
St. O
Peter O
’s O
that O
very O
cold O
Easter O
. O
" O
The O
clergyman O
, O
who O
had O
the O
air O
of O
one O
on O
a O
holiday O
, O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
ladies O
quite O
as O
clearly O
as O
they O
remembered O
him O
. O
But O
he O
came O
forward O
pleasantly O
enough O
and O
accepted O
the O
chair O
into O
which O
he O
was O
beckoned O
by O
Lucy O
. O
" O
I O
AM O
so O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
, O
who O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
spiritual O
starvation O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
see O
the O
waiter O
if O
her O
cousin O
had O
permitted O
it O
. O
" O
Just O
fancy O
how O
small O
the O
world O
is O

Summer O
Street O

too O
, O
makes O
it O
so O
specially O
funny O

" O
Miss O
Honeychurch O

parish O

said O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
filling O
up O
the O
gap O
, O
" O
and O
she O
happened O
to O
tell O
me O
in O
the O
course O
of O
conversation O
that O
you O
have O
just O
accepted O
the O
living O

" O
" O
Yes O

heard O
from O
mother O

last O

She O
did O

know O
that O
I O
knew O
you O
at O
Tunbridge O

but O
I O
wrote O
back O
at O
once O

and O
I O
said O
: O

" O
Quite O
right O

said O
the O
clergyman O
. O
" O
I O
move O
into O
the O
Rectory O
at O
Summer O
Street O
next O
June O

lucky O

such O
a O
charming O

Oh O

how O
glad O
I O
am O
! O
The O
name O
of O
our O
house O
is O

" O
Mr. O

bowed O

" O
I O
am O
eating O
it O

thank O
you O

and O
enjoying O
it O

" O
He O
preferred O
to O
talk O
to O
Lucy O
, O
whose O
playing O
he O
remembered O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
Miss O
Bartlett O
, O
who O
probably O
remembered O
his O
sermons O
. O
He O
asked O
the O
girl O
whether O
she O
knew O
Florence O
well O
, O
and O
was O
informed O
at O
some O
length O
that O
she O
had O
never O
been O
there O
before O
. O
It O
is O
delightful O
to O
advise O
a O
newcomer O
, O
and O
he O
was O
first O
in O
the O
field O
. O
" O
Do O
n’t O
neglect O
the O
country O
round O

" O
his O
advice O
concluded O
. O
" O
The O
first O
fine O
afternoon O
drive O
up O
to O
Fiesole O
, O
and O
round O
by O
Settignano O
, O
or O
something O
of O
that O
sort O
. O
" O
" O
No O
! O
" O
cried O
a O
voice O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
table O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Beebe O
, O
you O
are O
wrong O
. O
The O
first O
fine O
afternoon O
your O
ladies O
must O
go O
to O
Prato O
. O
" O
" O
That O
lady O
looks O
so O
clever O
, O
" O
whispered O
Miss O
Bartlett O
to O
her O
cousin O
. O
" O
We O
are O
in O
luck O
. O
" O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
a O
perfect O
torrent O
of O
information O
burst O
on O
them O
. O
People O
told O
them O
what O
to O
see O
, O
when O
to O
see O
it O
, O
how O
to O
stop O
the O
electric O
trams O
, O
how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
beggars O
, O
how O
much O
to O
give O
for O
a O
vellum O
blotter O
, O
how O
much O
the O
place O
would O
grow O
upon O
them O
. O
The O
Pension O
Bertolini O
had O
decided O
, O
almost O
enthusiastically O
, O
that O
they O
would O
do O
. O
Whichever O
way O
they O
looked O
, O
kind O
ladies O
smiled O
and O
shouted O
at O
them O
. O
And O
above O
all O
rose O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
clever O
lady O
, O
crying O
: O
" O
Prato O
! O
They O
must O
go O
to O
Prato O
. O
That O
place O
is O
too O
sweetly O
squalid O
for O
words O
. O
I O
love O
it O
; O
I O
revel O
in O
shaking O
off O
the O
trammels O
of O
respectability O
, O
as O
you O
know O
. O
" O
The O
young O
man O
named O
George O
glanced O
at O
the O
clever O
lady O
, O
and O
then O
returned O
moodily O
to O
his O
plate O
. O
Obviously O
he O
and O
his O
father O
did O
not O
do O
. O
Lucy O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
success O
, O
found O
time O
to O
wish O
they O
did O
. O
It O
gave O
her O
no O
extra O
pleasure O
that O
any O
one O
should O
be O
left O
in O
the O
cold O
; O
and O
when O
she O
rose O
to O
go O
, O
she O
turned O
back O
and O
gave O
the O
two O
outsiders O
a O
nervous O
little O
bow O
. O

My PRON_PER
Early O
Home O
The O
first O
place O
that O
I PRON_PER
can O
well O
remember O
was O
a O
large O
pleasant O
meadow O
with O
a O
pond O
of O
clear O
water O
in O
it O
. O
Some O
shady O
trees O
leaned O
over O
it O
, O
and O
rushes O
and O
water-lilies O
grew O
at O
the O
deep O
end O
. O
Over O
the O
hedge O
on O
one O
side O
we PRON_PER
looked O
into O
a O
plowed O
field O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
we PRON_PER
looked O
over O
a O
gate O
at O
our PRON_PER
master O
’s O
house O
, O
which O
stood O
by O
the O
roadside O
; O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
meadow O
was O
a O
grove O
of O
fir O
trees O
, O
and O
at O
the O
bottom O
a O
running O
brook O
overhung O
by O
a O
steep O
bank O
. O
While O
I O
was O
young O
I O
lived O
upon O
my O
mother O
’s O
milk O
, O
as O
I O
could O
not O
eat O
grass O
. O
In O
the O
daytime O
I O
ran O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
at O
night O
I O
lay O
down O
close O
by O
her O
. O
When O
it O
was O
hot O
we O
used O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
pond O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
when O
it O
was O
cold O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
warm O
shed O
near O
the O
grove O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
grass O
my O
mother O
used O
to O
go O
out O
to O
work O
in O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
come O
back O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
There O
were O
six O
young O
colts O
in O
the O
meadow O
besides O
me O
; O
they O
were O
older O
than O
I O
was O
; O
some O
were O
nearly O
as O
large O
as O
grown-up O
horses O
. O
I O
used O
to O
run O
with O
them O
, O
and O
had O
great O
fun O
; O
we O
used O
to O
gallop O
all O
together O
round O
and O
round O
the O
field O
as O
hard O
as O
we O
could O
go O
. O
Sometimes O
we O
had O
rather O
rough O
play O
, O
for O
they O
would O
frequently O
bite O
and O
kick O
as O
well O
as O
gallop O
. O
One O
day O
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
kicking O
, O
my O
mother O
whinnied O
to O
me O
to O
come O
to O
her O
, O
and O
then O
she O
said O
: O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
I O
am O
going O
to O
say O
to O
you O
. O
The O
colts O
who O
live O
here O
are O
very O
good O
colts O
, O
but O
they O
are O
cart-horse O
colts O
, O
and O
of O
course O
they O
have O
not O
learned O
manners O
. O
You O
have O
been O
well-bred O
and O
well-born O
; O
your O
father O
has O
a O
great O
name O
in O
these O
parts O
, O
and O
your O
grandfather O
won O
the O
cup O
two O
years O
at O
the O
Newmarket O
races O
; O
your O
grandmother O
had O
the O
sweetest O
temper O
of O
any O
horse O
I O
ever O
knew O
, O
and O
I O
think O
you O
have O
never O
seen O
me O
kick O
or O
bite O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
grow O
up O
gentle O
and O
good O
, O
and O
never O
learn O
bad O
ways O
; O
do O
your O
work O
with O
a O
good O
will O
, O
lift O
your O
feet O
up O
well O
when O
you O
trot O
, O
and O
never O
bite O
or O
kick O
even O
in O
play O
. O
" O
I O
have O
never O
forgotten O
my O
mother O
’s O
advice O
; O
I O
knew O
she O
was O
a O
wise O
old O
horse O
, O
and O
our O
master O
thought O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
her O
. O
Her O
name O
was O
Duchess O
, O
but O
he O
often O
called O
her O
Pet O
. O
Our O
master O
was O
a O
good O
, O
kind O
man O
. O
He O
gave O
us O
good O
food O
, O
good O
lodging O
, O
and O
kind O
words O
; O
he O
spoke O
as O
kindly O
to O
us O
as O
he O
did O
to O
his O
little O
children O
. O
We O
were O
all O
fond O
of O
him O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
loved O
him O
very O
much O
. O
When O
she O
saw O
him O
at O
the O
gate O
she O
would O
neigh O
with O
joy O
, O
and O
trot O
up O
to O
him O
. O
He O
would O
pat O
and O
stroke O
her O
and O
say O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
old O
Pet O
, O
and O
how O
is O
your O
little O
Darkie O
? O
" O
I O
was O
a O
dull O
black O
, O
so O
he O
called O
me O
Darkie O
; O
then O
he O
would O
give O
me O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
sometimes O
he O
brought O
a O
carrot O
for O
my O
mother O
. O
All O
the O
horses O
would O
come O
to O
him O
, O
but O
I O
think O
we O
were O
his O
favorites O
. O
My O
mother O
always O
took O
him O
to O
the O
town O
on O
a O
market O
day O
in O
a O
light O
gig O
. O
There O
was O
a O
plowboy O
, O
Dick O
, O
who O
sometimes O
came O
into O
our O
field O
to O
pluck O
blackberries O
from O
the O
hedge O
. O
When O
he O
had O
eaten O
all O
he O
wanted O
he O
would O
have O
what O
he O
called O
fun O
with O
the O
colts O
, O
throwing O
stones O
and O
sticks O
at O
them O
to O
make O
them O
gallop O
. O
We O
did O
not O
much O
mind O
him O
, O
for O
we O
could O
gallop O
off O
; O
but O
sometimes O
a O
stone O
would O
hit O
and O
hurt O
us O
. O
One O
day O
he O
was O
at O
this O
game O
, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the O
master O
was O
in O
the O
next O
field O
; O
but O
he O
was O
there O
, O
watching O
what O
was O
going O
on O
; O
over O
the O
hedge O
he O
jumped O
in O
a O
snap O
, O
and O
catching O
Dick O
by O
the O
arm O
, O
he O
gave O
him O
such O
a O
box O
on O
the O
ear O
as O
made O
him O
roar O
with O
the O
pain O
and O
surprise O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
we O
saw O
the O
master O
we O
trotted O
up O
nearer O
to O
see O
what O
went O
on O
. O
" O
Bad O
boy O
! O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
bad O
boy O
! O
to O
chase O
the O
colts O
. O
This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
, O
nor O
the O
second O
, O
but O
it O
shall O
be O
the O
last O
. O
There O
-- O
take O
your O
money O
and O
go O
home O
; O
I O
shall O
not O
want O
you O
on O
my O
farm O
again O
. O
" O
So O
we O
never O
saw O
Dick O
any O
more O
. O
Old O
Daniel O
, O
the O
man O
who O
looked O
after O
the O
horses O
, O
was O
just O
as O
gentle O
as O
our O
master O
, O
so O
we O
were O
well O
off O
. O

The O
Hunt O
Before O
I O
was O
two O
years O
old O
a O
circumstance O
happened O
which O
I O
have O
never O
forgotten O
. O
It O
was O
early O
in O
the O
spring O
; O
there O
had O
been O
a O
little O
frost O
in O
the O
night O
, O
and O
a O
light O
mist O
still O
hung O
over O
the O
woods O
and O
meadows O
. O
I O
and O
the O
other O
colts O
were O
feeding O
at O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
field O
when O
we O
heard O
, O
quite O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
what O
sounded O
like O
the O
cry O
of O
dogs O
. O
The O
oldest O
of O
the O
colts O
raised O
his O
head O
, O
pricked O
his O
ears O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
There O
are O
the O
hounds O
! O
" O
and O
immediately O
cantered O
off O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
to O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
field O
, O
where O
we O
could O
look O
over O
the O
hedge O
and O
see O
several O
fields O
beyond O
. O
My O
mother O
and O
an O
old O
riding O
horse O
of O
our O
master O
’s O
were O
also O
standing O
near O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
know O
all O
about O
it O
. O
" O
They O
have O
found O
a O
hare O
, O
" O
said O
my O
mother O
, O
" O
and O
if O
they O
come O
this O
way O
we O
shall O
see O
the O
hunt O
. O
" O
And O
soon O
the O
dogs O
were O
all O
tearing O
down O
the O
field O
of O
young O
wheat O
next O
to O
ours O
. O
I O
never O
heard O
such O
a O
noise O
as O
they O
made O
. O
They O
did O
not O
bark O
, O
nor O
howl O
, O
nor O
whine O
, O
but O
kept O
on O
a O
" O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
" O
at O
the O
top O
of O
their O
voices O
. O
After O
them O
came O
a O
number O
of O
men O
on O
horseback O
, O
some O
of O
them O
in O
green O
coats O
, O
all O
galloping O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
could O
. O
The O
old O
horse O
snorted O
and O
looked O
eagerly O
after O
them O
, O
and O
we O
young O
colts O
wanted O
to O
be O
galloping O
with O
them O
, O
but O
they O
were O
soon O
away O
into O
the O
fields O
lower O
down O
; O
here O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
had O
come O
to O
a O
stand O
; O
the O
dogs O
left O
off O
barking O
, O
and O
ran O
about O
every O
way O
with O
their O
noses O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
They O
have O
lost O
the O
scent O
, O
" O
said O
the O
old O
horse O
; O
" O
perhaps O
the O
hare O
will O
get O
off O
. O
" O
" O
What O
hare O
? O
" O
I O
said O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
hare O
; O
likely O
enough O
it O
may O
be O
one O
of O
our O
own O
hares O
out O
of O
the O
woods O
; O
any O
hare O
they O
can O
find O
will O
do O
for O
the O
dogs O
and O
men O
to O
run O
after O
; O
" O
and O
before O
long O
the O
dogs O
began O
their O
" O
yo O
! O
yo O
, O
o O
, O
o O
! O
" O
again O
, O
and O
back O
they O
came O
altogether O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
making O
straight O
for O
our O
meadow O
at O
the O
part O
where O
the O
high O
bank O
and O
hedge O
overhang O
the O
brook O
. O
" O
Now O
we O
shall O
see O
the O
hare O
, O
" O
said O
my O
mother O
; O
and O
just O
then O
a O
hare O
wild O
with O
fright O
rushed O
by O
and O
made O
for O
the O
woods O
. O
On O
came O
the O
dogs O
; O
they O
burst O
over O
the O
bank O
, O
leaped O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
came O
dashing O
across O
the O
field O
followed O
by O
the O
huntsmen O
. O
Six O
or O
eight O
men O
leaped O
their O
horses O
clean O
over O
, O
close O
upon O
the O
dogs O
. O
The O
hare O
tried O
to O
get O
through O
the O
fence O
; O
it O
was O
too O
thick O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
sharp O
round O
to O
make O
for O
the O
road O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
; O
the O
dogs O
were O
upon O
her O
with O
their O
wild O
cries O
; O
we O
heard O
one O
shriek O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
her O
. O
One O
of O
the O
huntsmen O
rode O
up O
and O
whipped O
off O
the O
dogs O
, O
who O
would O
soon O
have O
torn O
her O
to O
pieces O
. O
He O
held O
her O
up O
by O
the O
leg O
torn O
and O
bleeding O
, O
and O
all O
the O
gentlemen O
seemed O
well O
pleased O
. O
As O
for O
me O
, O
I O
was O
so O
astonished O
that O
I O
did O
not O
at O
first O
see O
what O
was O
going O
on O
by O
the O
brook O
; O
but O
when O
I O
did O
look O
there O
was O
a O
sad O
sight O
; O
two O
fine O
horses O
were O
down O
, O
one O
was O
struggling O
in O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
the O
other O
was O
groaning O
on O
the O
grass O
. O
One O
of O
the O
riders O
was O
getting O
out O
of O
the O
water O
covered O
with O
mud O
, O
the O
other O
lay O
quite O
still O
. O
" O
His O
neck O
is O
broke O
, O
" O
said O
my O
mother O
. O
" O
And O
serve O
him O
right O
, O
too O
, O
" O
said O
one O
of O
the O
colts O
. O
I O
thought O
the O
same O
, O
but O
my O
mother O
did O
not O
join O
with O
us O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
no O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
you O
must O
not O
say O
that O
; O
but O
though O
I O
am O
an O
old O
horse O
, O
and O
have O
seen O
and O
heard O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
I O
never O
yet O
could O
make O
out O
why O
men O
are O
so O
fond O
of O
this O
sport O
; O
they O
often O
hurt O
themselves O
, O
often O
spoil O
good O
horses O
, O
and O
tear O
up O
the O
fields O
, O
and O
all O
for O
a O
hare O
or O
a O
fox O
, O
or O
a O
stag O
, O
that O
they O
could O
get O
more O
easily O
some O
other O
way O
; O
but O
we O
are O
only O
horses O
, O
and O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O
" O
While O
my O
mother O
was O
saying O
this O
we O
stood O
and O
looked O
on O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
riders O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
young O
man O
; O
but O
my O
master O
, O
who O
had O
been O
watching O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
was O
the O
first O
to O
raise O
him O
. O
His O
head O
fell O
back O
and O
his O
arms O
hung O
down O
, O
and O
every O
one O
looked O
very O
serious O
. O
There O
was O
no O
noise O
now O
; O
even O
the O
dogs O
were O
quiet O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
know O
that O
something O
was O
wrong O
. O
They O
carried O
him O
to O
our O
master O
’s O
house O
. O
I O
heard O
afterward O
that O
it O
was O
young O
George O
Gordon O
, O
the O
squire O
’s O
only O
son O
, O
a O
fine O
, O
tall O
young O
man O
, O
and O
the O
pride O
of O
his O
family O
. O
There O
was O
now O
riding O
off O
in O
all O
directions O
to O
the O
doctor O
’s O
, O
to O
the O
farrier O
’s O
, O
and O
no O
doubt O
to O
Squire O
Gordon O
’s O
, O
to O
let O
him O
know O
about O
his O
son O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Bond O
, O
the O
farrier O
, O
came O
to O
look O
at O
the O
black O
horse O
that O
lay O
groaning O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
he O
felt O
him O
all O
over O
, O
and O
shook O
his O
head O
; O
one O
of O
his O
legs O
was O
broken O
. O
Then O
some O
one O
ran O
to O
our O
master O
’s O
house O
and O
came O
back O
with O
a O
gun O
; O
presently O
there O
was O
a O
loud O
bang O
and O
a O
dreadful O
shriek O
, O
and O
then O
all O
was O
still O
; O
the O
black O
horse O
moved O
no O
more O
. O
My O
mother O
seemed O
much O
troubled O
; O
she O
said O
she O
had O
known O
that O
horse O
for O
years O
, O
and O
that O
his O
name O
was O
" O
Rob O
Roy O
" O
; O
he O
was O
a O
good O
horse O
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
vice O
in O
him O
. O
She O
never O
would O
go O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the O
field O
afterward O
. O

PART O
I O
I O
THIS O
is O
the O
saddest O
story O
I PRON_PER
have O
ever O
heard O
. O
We PRON_PER
had O
known O
the NOM_PER
Ashburnhams NOM_PER
for O
nine O
seasons O
of O
the O
town O
of O
Nauheim O
with O
an O
extreme O
intimacy O
-- O
or O
, O
rather O
with O
an O
acquaintanceship O
as O
loose O
and O
easy O
and O
yet O
as O
close O
as O
a O
good O
glove O
's O
with O
your PRON_PER
hand O
. O
My NOM_PER
wife NOM_PER
and O
I O
knew O
Captain O
and O
Mrs O
Ashburnham O
as O
well O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
know O
anybody O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
in O
another O
sense O
, O
we O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all O
about O
them O
. O
This O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a O
state O
of O
things O
only O
possible O
with O
English O
people O
of O
whom O
, O
till O
today O
, O
when O
I O
sit O
down O
to O
puzzle O
out O
what O
I O
know O
of O
this O
sad O
affair O
, O
I O
knew O
nothing O
whatever O
. O
Six O
months O
ago O
I O
had O
never O
been O
to O
England O
, O
and O
, O
certainly O
, O
I O
had O
never O
sounded O
the O
depths O
of O
an O
English O
heart O
. O
I O
had O
known O
the O
shallows O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
we O
were O
not O
acquainted O
with O
many O
English O
people O
. O
Living O
, O
as O
we O
perforce O
lived O
, O
in O
Europe O
, O
and O
being O
, O
as O
we O
perforce O
were O
, O
leisured O
Americans O
, O
which O
is O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
that O
we O
were O
un-American O
, O
we O
were O
thrown O
very O
much O
into O
the O
society O
of O
the O
nicer O
English O
. O
Paris O
, O
you O
see O
, O
was O
our O
home O
. O
Somewhere O
between O
Nice O
and O
Bordighera O
provided O
yearly O
winter O
quarters O
for O
us O
, O
and O
Nauheim O
always O
received O
us O
from O
July O
to O
September O
. O
You O
will O
gather O
from O
this O
statement O
that O
one O
of O
us O
had O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
, O
a O
" O
heart O
" O
, O
and O
, O
from O
the O
statement O
that O
my O
wife O
is O
dead O
, O
that O
she O
was O
the O
sufferer O
. O
Captain O
Ashburnham O
also O
had O
a O
heart O
. O
But O
, O
whereas O
a O
yearly O
month O
or O
so O
at O
Nauheim O
tuned O
him O
up O
to O
exactly O
the O
right O
pitch O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
twelvemonth O
, O
the O
two O
months O
or O
so O
were O
only O
just O
enough O
to O
keep O
poor O
Florence O
alive O
from O
year O
to O
year O
. O
The O
reason O
for O
his O
heart O
was O
, O
approximately O
, O
polo O
, O
or O
too O
much O
hard O
sportsmanship O
in O
his O
youth O
. O
The O
reason O
for O
poor O
Florence O
's O
broken O
years O
was O
a O
storm O
at O
sea O
upon O
our O
first O
crossing O
to O
Europe O
, O
and O
the O
immediate O
reasons O
for O
our O
imprisonment O
in O
that O
continent O
were O
doctor O
's O
orders O
. O
They O
said O
that O
even O
the O
short O
Channel O
crossing O
might O
well O
kill O
the O
poor O
thing O
. O
When O
we O
all O
first O
met O
, O
Captain O
Ashburnham O
, O
home O
on O
sick O
leave O
from O
an O
India O
to O
which O
he O
was O
never O
to O
return O
, O
was O
thirty-three O
; O
Mrs O
Ashburnham O
Leonora O
-- O
was O
thirty-one O
. O
I O
was O
thirty-six O
and O
poor O
Florence O
thirty O
. O
Thus O
today O
Florence O
would O
have O
been O
thirty-nine O
and O
Captain O
Ashburnham O
forty-two O
; O
whereas O
I O
am O
forty-five O
and O
Leonora O
forty O
. O
You O
will O
perceive O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
our O
friendship O
has O
been O
a O
young-middle-aged O
affair O
, O
since O
we O
were O
all O
of O
us O
of O
quite O
quiet O
dispositions O
, O
the O
Ashburnhams O
being O
more O
particularly O
what O
in O
England O
it O
is O
the O
custom O
to O
call O
" O
quite O
good O
people O
" O
. O
They O
were O
descended O
, O
as O
you O
will O
probably O
expect O
, O
from O
the O
Ashburnham O
who O
accompanied O
Charles O
I O
to O
the O
scaffold O
, O
and O
, O
as O
you O
must O
also O
expect O
with O
this O
class O
of O
English O
people O
, O
you O
would O
never O
have O
noticed O
it O
. O
Mrs O
Ashburnham O
was O
a O
Powys O
; O
Florence O
was O
a O
Hurlbird O
of O
Stamford O
, O
Connecticut O
, O
where O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
they O
are O
more O
old-fashioned O
than O
even O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Cranford O
, O
England O
, O
could O
have O
been O
. O
I O
myself O
am O
a O
Dowell O
of O
Philadelphia O
, O
Pa. O
, O
where O
, O
it O
is O
historically O
true O
, O
there O
are O
more O
old O
English O
families O
than O
you O
would O
find O
in O
any O
six O
English O
counties O
taken O
together O
. O
I O
carry O
about O
with O
me O
, O
indeed O
-- O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
invisibly O
anchored O
me O
to O
any O
spot O
upon O
the O
globe O
-- O
the O
title O
deeds O
of O
my O
farm O
, O
which O
once O
covered O
several O
blocks O
between O
Chestnut O
and O
Walnut O
Streets O
. O
These O
title O
deeds O
are O
of O
wampum O
, O
the O
grant O
of O
an O
Indian O
chief O
to O
the O
first O
Dowell O
, O
who O
left O
Farnham O
in O
Surrey O
in O
company O
with O
William O
Penn O
. O
Florence O
's O
people O
, O
as O
is O
so O
often O
the O
case O
with O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Connecticut O
, O
came O
from O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
Fordingbridge O
, O
where O
the O
Ashburnhams O
' O
place O
is O
. O
From O
there O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
am O
actually O
writing O
. O
You O
may O
well O
ask O
why O
I O
write O
. O
And O
yet O
my O
reasons O
are O
quite O
many O
. O
For O
it O
is O
not O
unusual O
in O
human O
beings O
who O
have O
witnessed O
the O
sack O
of O
a O
city O
or O
the O
falling O
to O
pieces O
of O
a O
people O
to O
desire O
to O
set O
down O
what O
they O
have O
witnessed O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
unknown O
heirs O
or O
of O
generations O
infinitely O
remote O
; O
or O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
just O
to O
get O
the O
sight O
out O
of O
their O
heads O
. O
Some O
one O
has O
said O
that O
the O
death O
of O
a O
mouse O
from O
cancer O
is O
the O
whole O
sack O
of O
Rome O
by O
the O
Goths O
, O
and O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
that O
the O
breaking O
up O
of O
our O
little O
four-square O
coterie O
was O
such O
another O
unthinkable O
event O
. O
Supposing O
that O
you O
should O
come O
upon O
us O
sitting O
together O
at O
one O
of O
the O
little O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
club O
house O
, O
let O
us O
say O
, O
at O
Homburg O
, O
taking O
tea O
of O
an O
afternoon O
and O
watching O
the O
miniature O
golf O
, O
you O
would O
have O
said O
that O
, O
as O
human O
affairs O
go O
, O
we O
were O
an O
extraordinarily O
safe O
castle O
. O
We O
were O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
one O
of O
those O
tall O
ships O
with O
the O
white O
sails O
upon O
a O
blue O
sea O
, O
one O
of O
those O
things O
that O
seem O
the O
proudest O
and O
the O
safest O
of O
all O
the O
beautiful O
and O
safe O
things O
that O
God O
has O
permitted O
the O
mind O
of O
men O
to O
frame O
. O
Where O
better O
could O
one O
take O
refuge O
? O
Where O
better O
? O
Permanence O
? O
Stability O
? O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
it O
's O
gone O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
that O
long O
, O
tranquil O
life O
, O
which O
was O
just O
stepping O
a O
minuet O
, O
vanished O
in O
four O
crashing O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
nine O
years O
and O
six O
weeks O
. O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
yes O
, O
our O
intimacy O
was O
like O
a O
minuet O
, O
simply O
because O
on O
every O
possible O
occasion O
and O
in O
every O
possible O
circumstance O
we O
knew O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
sit O
, O
which O
table O
we O
unanimously O
should O
choose O
; O
and O
we O
could O
rise O
and O
go O
, O
all O
four O
together O
, O
without O
a O
signal O
from O
any O
one O
of O
us O
, O
always O
to O
the O
music O
of O
the O
Kur O
orchestra O
, O
always O
in O
the O
temperate O
sunshine O
, O
or O
, O
if O
it O
rained O
, O
in O
discreet O
shelters O
. O
No O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
gone O
. O
You O
ca O
n't O
kill O
a O
minuet O
de O
la O
cour O
. O
You O
may O
shut O
up O
the O
music-book O
, O
close O
the O
harpsichord O
; O
in O
the O
cupboard O
and O
presses O
the O
rats O
may O
destroy O
the O
white O
satin O
favours O
. O
The O
mob O
may O
sack O
Versailles O
; O
the O
Trianon O
may O
fall O
, O
but O
surely O
the O
minuet O
-- O
the O
minuet O
itself O
is O
dancing O
itself O
away O
into O
the O
furthest O
stars O
, O
even O
as O
our O
minuet O
of O
the O
Hessian O
bathing O
places O
must O
be O
stepping O
itself O
still O
. O
Is O
n't O
there O
any O
heaven O
where O
old O
beautiful O
dances O
, O
old O
beautiful O
intimacies O
prolong O
themselves O
? O
Is O
n't O
there O
any O
Nirvana O
pervaded O
by O
the O
faint O
thrilling O
of O
instruments O
that O
have O
fallen O
into O
the O
dust O
of O
wormwood O
but O
that O
yet O
had O
frail O
, O
tremulous O
, O
and O
everlasting O
souls O
? O
No O
, O
by O
God O
, O
it O
is O
false O
! O
It O
was O
n't O
a O
minuet O
that O
we O
stepped O
; O
it O
was O
a O
prison O
-- O
a O
prison O
full O
of O
screaming O
hysterics O
, O
tied O
down O
so O
that O
they O
might O
not O
outsound O
the O
rolling O
of O
our O
carriage O
wheels O
as O
we O
went O
along O
the O
shaded O
avenues O
of O
the O
Taunus O
Wald O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
swear O
by O
the O
sacred O
name O
of O
my O
creator O
that O
it O
was O
true O
. O
It O
was O
true O
sunshine O
; O
the O
true O
music O
; O
the O
true O
splash O
of O
the O
fountains O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
stone O
dolphins O
. O
For O
, O
if O
for O
me O
we O
were O
four O
people O
with O
the O
same O
tastes O
, O
with O
the O
same O
desires O
, O
acting O
-- O
or O
, O
no O
, O
not O
acting O
-- O
sitting O
here O
and O
there O
unanimously O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
the O
truth O
? O
If O
for O
nine O
years O
I O
have O
possessed O
a O
goodly O
apple O
that O
is O
rotten O
at O
the O
core O
and O
discover O
its O
rottenness O
only O
in O
nine O
years O
and O
six O
months O
less O
four O
days O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
true O
to O
say O
that O
for O
nine O
years O
I O
possessed O
a O
goodly O
apple O
? O
So O
it O
may O
well O
be O
with O
Edward O
Ashburnham O
, O
with O
Leonora O
his O
wife O
and O
with O
poor O
dear O
Florence O
. O
And O
, O
if O
you O
come O
to O
think O
of O
it O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
a O
little O
odd O
that O
the O
physical O
rottenness O
of O
at O
least O
two O
pillars O
of O
our O
four-square O
house O
never O
presented O
itself O
to O
my O
mind O
as O
a O
menace O
to O
its O
security O
? O
It O
does O
n't O
so O
present O
itself O
now O
though O
the O
two O
of O
them O
are O
actually O
dead O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
... O
. O
I O
know O
nothing O
-- O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
-- O
of O
the O
hearts O
of O
men O
. O
I O
only O
know O
that O
I O
am O
alone O
-- O
horribly O
alone O
. O
No O
hearthstone O
will O
ever O
again O
witness O
, O
for O
me O
, O
friendly O
intercourse O
. O
No O
smoking-room O
will O
ever O
be O
other O
than O
peopled O
with O
incalculable O
simulacra O
amidst O
smoke O
wreaths O
. O
Yet O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
God O
, O
what O
should O
I O
know O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
life O
of O
the O
hearth O
and O
of O
the O
smoking-room O
, O
since O
my O
whole O
life O
has O
been O
passed O
in O
those O
places O
? O
The O
warm O
hearthside O
! O
-- O
Well O
, O
there O
was O
Florence O
: O
I O
believe O
that O
for O
the O
twelve O
years O
her O
life O
lasted O
, O
after O
the O
storm O
that O
seemed O
irretrievably O
to O
have O
weakened O
her O
heart O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
for O
one O
minute O
she O
was O
out O
of O
my O
sight O
, O
except O
when O
she O
was O
safely O
tucked O
up O
in O
bed O
and O
I O
should O
be O
downstairs O
, O
talking O
to O
some O
good O
fellow O
or O
other O
in O
some O
lounge O
or O
smoking-room O
or O
taking O
my O
final O
turn O
with O
a O
cigar O
before O
going O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
understand O
, O
blame O
Florence O
. O
But O
how O
can O
she O
have O
known O
what O
she O
knew O
? O
How O
could O
she O
have O
got O
to O
know O
it O
? O
To O
know O
it O
so O
fully O
. O
Heavens O
! O
There O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
the O
actual O
time O
. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
when O
I O
was O
taking O
my O
baths O
, O
and O
my O
Swedish O
exercises O
, O
being O
manicured O
. O
Leading O
the O
life O
I O
did O
, O
of O
the O
sedulous O
, O
strained O
nurse O
, O
I O
had O
to O
do O
something O
to O
keep O
myself O
fit O
. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
then O
! O
Yet O
even O
that O
ca O
n't O
have O
been O
enough O
time O
to O
get O
the O
tremendously O
long O
conversations O
full O
of O
worldly O
wisdom O
that O
Leonora O
has O
reported O
to O
me O
since O
their O
deaths O
. O
And O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
imagine O
that O
during O
our O
prescribed O
walks O
in O
Nauheim O
and O
the O
neighbourhood O
she O
found O
time O
to O
carry O
on O
the O
protracted O
negotiations O
which O
she O
did O
carry O
on O
between O
Edward O
Ashburnham O
and O
his O
wife O
? O
And O
is O
n't O
it O
incredible O
that O
during O
all O
that O
time O
Edward O
and O
Leonora O
never O
spoke O
a O
word O
to O
each O
other O
in O
private O
? O
What O
is O
one O
to O
think O
of O
humanity O
? O
For O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
that O
they O
were O
the O
model O
couple O
. O
He O
was O
as O
devoted O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
be O
without O
appearing O
fatuous O
. O
So O
well O
set O
up O
, O
with O
such O
honest O
blue O
eyes O
, O
such O
a O
touch O
of O
stupidity O
, O
such O
a O
warm O
goodheartedness O
! O
And O
she O
-- O
so O
tall O
, O
so O
splendid O
in O
the O
saddle O
, O
so O
fair O
! O
Yes O
, O
Leonora O
was O
extraordinarily O
fair O
and O
so O
extraordinarily O
the O
real O
thing O
that O
she O
seemed O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
get O
it O
all O
so O
superlatively O
together O
. O
To O
be O
the O
county O
family O
, O
to O
look O
the O
county O
family O
, O
to O
be O
so O
appropriately O
and O
perfectly O
wealthy O
; O
to O
be O
so O
perfect O
in O
manner O
-- O
even O
just O
to O
the O
saving O
touch O
of O
insolence O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
necessary O
. O
To O
have O
all O
that O
and O
to O
be O
all O
that O
! O
No O
, O
it O
was O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
only O
this O
afternoon O
, O
talking O
over O
the O
whole O
matter O
she O
said O
to O
me O
: O
" O
Once O
I O
tried O
to O
have O
a O
lover O
but O
I O
was O
so O
sick O
at O
the O
heart O
, O
so O
utterly O
worn O
out O
that O
I O
had O
to O
send O
him O
away O
. O
" O
That O
struck O
me O
as O
the O
most O
amazing O
thing O
I O
had O
ever O
heard O
. O
She O
said O
" O
I O
was O
actually O
in O
a O
man O
's O
arms O
. O
Such O
a O
nice O
chap O
! O
Such O
a O
dear O
fellow O
! O
And O
I O
was O
saying O
to O
myself O
, O
fiercely O
, O
hissing O
it O
between O
my O
teeth O
, O
as O
they O
say O
in O
novels O
-- O
and O
really O
clenching O
them O
together O
: O
I O
was O
saying O
to O
myself O
: O
' O
Now O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
for O
it O
and O
I O
'll O
really O
have O
a O
good O
time O
for O
once O
in O
my O
life O
-- O
for O
once O
in O
my O
life O
! O
' O
It O
was O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
in O
a O
carriage O
, O
coming O
back O
from O
a O
hunt O
ball O
. O
Eleven O
miles O
we O
had O
to O
drive O
! O
And O
then O
suddenly O
the O
bitterness O
of O
the O
endless O
poverty O
, O
of O
the O
endless O
acting O
-- O
it O
fell O
on O
me O
like O
a O
blight O
, O
it O
spoilt O
everything O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
had O
to O
realize O
that O
I O
had O
been O
spoilt O
even O
for O
the O
good O
time O
when O
it O
came O
. O
And O
I O
burst O
out O
crying O
and O
I O
cried O
and O
I O
cried O
for O
the O
whole O
eleven O
miles O
. O
Just O
imagine O
me O
crying O
! O
And O
just O
imagine O
me O
making O
a O
fool O
of O
the O
poor O
dear O
chap O
like O
that O
. O
It O
certainly O
was O
n't O
playing O
the O
game O
, O
was O
it O
now O

CHAPTER O

DESCRIPTION O
OF O
FARMER PROP_PER
OAK PROP_PER
-- O
AN O
INCIDENT O
When O
Farmer PROP_PER
Oak PROP_PER
smiled O
, O
the O
corners O
of O
his PRON_PER
mouth O
spread O
till O
they O
were O
within O
an O
unimportant O
distance O
of O
his PRON_PER
ears O
, O
his PRON_PER
eyes O
were O
reduced O
to O
chinks O
, O
and O
diverging O
wrinkles O
appeared O
round O
them O
, O
extending O
upon O
his PRON_PER
countenance O
like O
the O
rays O
in O
a O
rudimentary O
sketch O
of O
the O
rising O
sun O
. O
His PRON_PER
Christian O
name O
was O
Gabriel PROP_PER
, O
and O
on O
working O
days O
he PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
sound NOM_PER
judgment NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
easy NOM_PER
motions NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
proper NOM_PER
dress NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
general NOM_PER
good NOM_PER
character NOM_PER
. O
On O
Sundays O
he PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
misty NOM_PER
views NOM_PER
, O
rather O
given O
to O
postponing O
, O
and O
hampered O
by O
his PRON_PER
best O
clothes O
and O
umbrella O
: O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
one O
who O
felt O
himself PRON_PER
to O
occupy O
morally O
that O
vast O
middle O
space O
of O
Laodicean O
neutrality O
which O
lay O
between O
the NOM_PER
Communion NOM_PER
people NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
parish NOM_PER
and O
the NOM_PER
drunken NOM_PER
section NOM_PER
, O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
he PRON_PER
went O
to O
church O
, O
but O
yawned O
privately O
by O
the O
time O
the O
con O
- O
gegation O
reached O
the O
Nicene O
creed O
, O
- O
and O
thought O
of O
what O
there O
would O
be O
for O
dinner O
when O
he PRON_PER
meant O
to O
be O
listening O
to O
the O
sermon O
. O
Or O
, O
to O
state O
his PRON_PER
character O
as O
it O
stood O
in O
the O
scale O
of O
public O
opinion O
, O
when O
his NOM_PER
friends NOM_PER
and O
critics O
were O
in O
tantrums O
, O
he O
was O
considered O
rather O
a O
bad O
man O
; O
when O
they O
were O
pleased O
, O
he O
was O
rather O
a O
good O
man O
; O
when O
they O
were O
neither O
, O
he O
was O
a O
man O
whose O
moral O
colour O
was O
a O
kind O
of O
pepper-and-salt O
mixture O
. O
Since O
he O
lived O
six O
times O
as O
many O
working-days O
as O
Sundays O
, O
Oak O
's O
appearance O
in O
his O
old O
clothes O
was O
most O
peculiarly O
his O
own O
-- O
the O
mental O
picture O
formed O
by O
his O
neighbours O
in O
imagining O
him O
being O
always O
dressed O
in O
that O
way O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
low-crowned O
felt O
hat O
, O
spread O
out O
at O
the O
base O
by O
tight O
jamming O
upon O
the O
head O
for O
security O
in O
high O
winds O
, O
and O
a O
coat O
like O
Dr. O
Johnson O
's O
; O
his O
lower O
extremities O
being O
encased O
in O
ordinary O
leather O
leggings O
and O
boots O
emphatically O
large O
, O
affording O
to O
each O
foot O
a O
roomy O
apartment O
so O
constructed O
that O
any O
wearer O
might O
stand O
in O
a O
river O
all O
day O
long O
and O
know O
nothing O
of O
damp O
-- O
their O
maker O
being O
a O
conscientious O
man O
who O
endeavoured O
to O
compensate O
for O
any O
weakness O
in O
his O
cut O
by O
unstinted O
dimension O
and O
solidity O
. O
Mr. O
Oak O
carried O
about O
him O
, O
by O
way O
of O
watch O
, O
- O
what O
may O
be O
called O
a O
small O
silver O
clock O
; O
in O
other O
words O
, O
it O
was O
a O
watch O
as O
to O
shape O
and O
intention O
, O
and O
a O
small O
clock O
as O
to O
size O
. O
This O
instrument O
being O
several O
years O
older O
than O
Oak O
's O
grandfather O
, O
had O
the O
peculiarity O
of O
going O
either O
too O
fast O
or O
not O
at O
all O
. O
The O
smaller O
of O
its O
hands O
, O
too O
, O
occasionally O
slipped O
round O
on O
the O
pivot O
, O
and O
thus O
, O
though O
the O
minutes O
were O
told O
with O
precision O
, O
nobody O
could O
be O
quite O
certain O
of O
the O
hour O
they O
belonged O
to O
. O
The O
stopping O
peculiarity O
of O
his O
watch O
Oak O
remedied O
by O
thumps O
and O
shakes O
, O
and O
he O
escaped O
any O
evil O
consequences O
from O
the O
other O
two O
defects O
by O
constant O
comparisons O
with O
and O
observations O
of O
the O
sun O
and O
stars O
, O
and O
by O
pressing O
his O
face O
close O
to O
the O
glass O
of O
his O
neighbours O
' O
windows O
, O
till O
he O
could O
discern O
the O
hour O
marked O
by O
the O
green-faced O
timekeepers O
within O
. O
It O
may O
be O
mentioned O
that O
Oak O
's O
fob O
being O
difficult O
of O
access O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
its O
somewhat O
high O
situation O
in O
the O
waistband O
of O
his O
trousers O
( O
which O
also O
lay O
at O
a O
remote O
height O
under O
his O
waistcoat O
) O
, O
the O
watch O
was O
as O
a O
necessity O
pulled O
out O
by O
throwing O
the O
body O
to O
one O
side O
, O
compressing O
the O
mouth O
and O
face O
to O
a O
mere O
mass O
of O
ruddy O
flesh O
on O
account O
of O
the O
exertion O
, O
and O
drawing O
up O
the O
watch O
by O
its O
chain O
, O
like O
a O
bucket O
from O
a O
well O
. O
But O
some O
thoughtfull O
persons O
, O
who O
had O
seen O
him O
walking O
across O
one O
of O
his O
fields O
on O
a O
certain O
December O
morning O
-- O
sunny O
and O
exceedingly O
mild O
-- O
might O
have O
regarded O
Gabriel O
Oak O
in O
other O
aspects O
than O
these O
. O
In O
his O
face O
one O
might O
notice O
that O
many O
of O
the O
hues O
and O
curves O
of O
youth O
had O
tarried O
on O
to O
manhood O
: O
there O
even O
remained O
in O
his O
remoter O
crannies O
some O
relics O
of O
the O
boy O
. O
His O
height O
and O
breadth O
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
to O
make O
his O
presence O
imposing O
, O
had O
they O
been O
exhibited O
with O
due O
consideration O
. O
But O
there O
is O
a O
way O
some O
men O
have O
, O
rural O
and O
urban O
alike O
, O
for O
which O
the O
mind O
is O
more O
responsible O
than O
flesh O
and O
sinew O
: O
it O
is O
a O
way O
of O
curtail O
- O
ing O
their O
dimensions O
by O
their O
manner O
of O
showing O
them O
. O
And O
from O
a O
quiet O
modesty O
that O
would O
have O
become O
a O
vestal O
which O
seemed O
continually O
to O
impress O
upon O
him O
that O
he O
had O
no O
great O
claim O
on O
the O
world O
's O
room O
, O
Oak O
walked O
unassumingly O
and O
with O
a O
faintly O
perceptible O
bend O
, O
yet O
distinct O
from O
a O
bowing O
of O
the O
shoulders O
. O
This O
may O
be O
said O
to O
be O
a O
defect O
in O
an O
individual O
if O
he O
depends O
for O
his O
valuation O
more O
upon O
his O
appearance O
than O
upon O
his O
capacity O
to O
wear O
well O
, O
which O
Oak O
did O
not O
. O
He O
had O
just O
reached O
the O
time O
of O
life O
at O
which O
" O
young O
" O
is O
ceasing O
to O
be O
the O
prefix O
of O
" O
man O
" O
in O
speaking O
of O
one O
. O
He O
was O
at O
the O
brightest O
period O
of O
masculine O
growth O
, O
for O
his O
intellect O
and O
his O
emotions O
were O
clearly O
separated O
: O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
time O
during O
which O
the O
influence O
of O
youth O
indiscriminately O
mingles O
them O
in O
the O
character O
of O
impulse O
, O
and O
he O
had O
not O
yet O
arrived O
at O
the O
stage O
wherein O
they O
become O
united O
again O
, O
in O
the O
character O
of O
prejudice O
, O
by O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
wife O
and O
family O
. O
In O
short O
, O
he O
was O
twenty-eight O
, O
and O
a O
bachelor O
. O
The O
field O
he O
was O
in O
this O
morning O
sloped O
to O
a O
ridge O
called O
Norcombe O
Hill O
. O
Through O
a O
spur O
of O
this O
hill O
ran O
the O
highway O
between O
Emminster O
and O
Chalk O
- O
Newton O
. O
Casually O
glancing O
over O
the O
hedge O
, O
Oak O
saw O
coming O
down O
the O
incline O
before O
him O
an O
ornamental O
spring O
waggon O
, O
painted O
yellow O
and O
gaily O
marked O
, O
drawn O
by O
two O
horses O
, O
a O
waggoner O
walking O
alongside O
bearing O
a O
whip O
perpendicularly O
. O
The O
waggon O
was O
laden O
with O
household O
goods O
and O
window O
plants O
, O
and O
on O
the O
apex O
of O
the O
whole O
sat O
a O
woman O
, O
" O
young O
" O
and O
attractive O
. O
Gabriel O
had O
not O
beheld O
the O
sight O
for O
more O
than O
half O
a O
minute O
, O
when O
the O
vehicle O
was O
brought O
to O
a O
standstill O
just O
beneath O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
The O
tailboard O
of O
the O
waggon O
is O
gone O
, O
Miss. O
" O
said O
the O
waggoner O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
heard O
it O
fall O
. O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
, O
in O
a O
soft O
, O
though O
not O
particularly O
low O
voice O
. O
" O
I O
heard O
a O
noise O
I O
could O
not O
account O
for O
when O
we O
were O
coming O
up O
the O
hill O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'll O
run O
back O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
. O
" O
she O
answered O
. O
The O
sensible O
horses O
stood O
-- O
perfectly O
still O
, O
and O
the O
waggoner O
's O
steps O
sank O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
The O
girl O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
load O
sat O
motionless O
, O
surrounded O
by O
tables O
and O
chairs O
with O
their O
legs O
upwards O
, O
backed O
by O
an O
oak O
settle O
, O
and O
ornamented O
in O
front O
by O
pots O
of O
geraniums O
, O
myrtles O
, O
and O
cactuses O
, O
together O
with O
a O
caged O
canary O
-- O
all O
probably O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
house O
just O
vacated O
. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
cat O
in O
a O
willow O
basket O
, O
from O
the O
partly-opened O
lid O
of O
which O
she O
gazed O
with O
half-closed O
eyes O
, O
and O
affectionately-surveyed O
the O
small O
birds O
around O
. O
The O
handsome O
girl O
waited O
for O
some O
time O
idly O
in O
her O
place O
, O
and O
the O
only O
sound O
heard O
in O
the O
stillness O
was O
the O
hopping O
of O
the O
canary O
up-and O
down O
the O
perches O
of O
its O
prison O
. O
Then O
she O
looked O
attentively O
downwards O
. O
It O
was O
not O
at O
the O
bird O
, O
nor O
at O
the O
cat O
; O
it O
was O
at O
an O
oblong O
package O
tied O
in O
paper O
, O
and O
lying O
between O
them O
. O
She O
turned O
her O
head O
to O
learn O
if O
the O
waggoner O
were O
coming O
. O
He O
was O
not O
yet O
in O
sight O
; O
and O
her-eyes O
crept O
back O
to O
the O
package O
, O
her O
thoughts O
seeming O
to O
run O
upon O
what O
was O
inside O
it O
. O
At O
length O
she O
drew O
the O
article O
into O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
untied O
the O
paper O
covering O
; O
a O
small O
swing O
looking-glass O
was O
disclosed O
, O
in O
which O
she O
proceeded O
to O
survey O
herself O
attentively O
. O
She O
parted O
her O
lips O
and O
smiled O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fine O
morning O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
lighted O
up O
to O
a O
scarlet O
glow O
the O
crimson O
jacket O
she O
wore O
, O
and O
painted O
a O
soft O
lustre O
upon O
her O
bright O
face O
and O
dark O
hair O
. O
The O
myrtles O
, O
geraniums O
, O
and O
cactuses O
packed O
around O
her O
were O
fresh O
and O
green O
, O
and O
at O
such O
a O
leafless O
season O
they O
invested O
the O
whole O
concern O
of O
horses O
, O
waggon O
, O
furniture O
, O
and O
girl O
with O
a O
peculiar O
vernal O
charm O
. O
What O
possessed O
her O
to O
indulge O
in O
such O
a O
performance O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
sparrows O
, O
blackbirds O
, O
and O
unperceived O
farmer O
who O
were O
alone O
its O
spectators O
, O
-- O
whether O
the O
smile O
began O
as O
a O
factitious O
one O
, O
to O
test O
her O
capacity O
in O
that O
art O
, O
-- O
nobody O
knows O
; O
it O
ended O
certainly O
in O
a O
real O
smile O
. O
She O
blushed O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
seeing O
her O
reflection O
blush O
, O
blushed O
the O
more O
. O
The O
change O
from O
the O
customary O
spot O
and O
necessary O
occasion O
of O
such O
an O
act O
-- O
from O
the O
dressing O
hour O
in O
a O
bedroom O
to O
a O
time O
of O
travelling O
out O
of O
doors O
-- O
lent O
to O
the O
idle O
deed O
a O
novelty O
it O
did O
not O
intrinsically O
possess O
. O
The O
picture O
was O
a O
delicate O
one O
. O
Woman O
's O
prescriptive O
infirmity O
had O
stalked O
into O
the O
sunlight O
, O
which O
had O
clothed O
it O
in O
the O
freshness O
of O
an O
originality O
. O
A O
cynical O
inference O
was O
irresistible O
by O
Gabriel O
Oak O
as O
he O
regarded O
the O
scene O
, O
generous O
though O
he O
fain O
would O
have O
been O
. O
There O
was O
no O
necessity O
whatever O
for O
her O
looking O
in O
the O
glass O
. O
She O
did O
not O
adjust O
her O
hat O
, O
or O
pat O
her O
hair O
, O
or O
press O
a O
dimple O
into O
shape O
, O
or O
do O
one O
thing O
to O
signify O
that O
any O
such O
intention O
had O
been O
her O
motive O
in O
taking O
up O
the O
glass O
. O
She O
simply O
observed O
herself O
as O
a O
fair O
product O
of O
Nature O
in O
the O
feminine O
kind O
, O
her O
thoughts O
seeming O
to O
glide O
into O
far-off O
though O
likely O
dramas O
in O
which O
men O
would O
play O
a O
part O
-- O
vistas O
of O
probable O
triumphs O
-- O
the O
smiles O
being O
of O
a O
phase O
suggesting O
that O
hearts O
were O
imagined O
as O
lost O
and O
won O
. O
Still O
, O
this O
was O
but O
conjecture O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
series O
of O
actions O
was O
so O
idly O
put O
forth O
as O
to O
make O
it O
rash O
to O
assert O
that O
intention O
had O
any O
part O
in O
them O
at O
all O
. O
The O
waggoner O
's O
steps O
were O
heard O
returning O
. O
She O
put O
the O
glass O
in O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
again O
into O
its O
place O
. O
When O
the O
waggon O
had O
passed O
on O
, O
Gabriel O
withdrew O
from O
his O
point O
of O
espial O
, O
and O
descending O
into O
the O
road O
, O
followed O
the O
vehicle O
to O
the O
turnpike-gate O
some O
way O
beyond O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
where O
the O
object O
of O
his O
contemplation O
now O
halted O
for O
the O
payment O
of O
toll O
. O
About O
twenty O
steps O
still O
remained O
between O
him O
and O
the O
gate O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
a O
dispute O
. O
lt O
was O
a O
difference O
con O
- O
cerning O
twopence O
between O
the O
persons O
with O
the O
waggon O
and O
the O
man O
at O
the O
toll-bar O
. O
" O
Mis O
' O
ess O
's O
niece O
is O
upon O
the O
top O
of O
the O
things O
, O
and O
she O
says O
that O
's O
enough O
that O
I O
've O
offered O
ye O
, O
you O
great O
miser O
, O
and O
she O
wo O
n't O
pay O
any O
more O
. O
" O
These O
were O
the O
waggoner O
's O
words O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
; O
then O
mis O
' O
ess O
's O
niece O
ca O
n't O
pass O
. O
" O
said O
the O
turnpike-keeper O
, O
closing O
the O
gate O
. O
Oak O
looked O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
of O
the O
disputants O
, O
and O
fell O
into O
a O
reverie O
. O
There O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
twopence O
remarkably O
insignificant O
. O
Threepence O
had O
a O
definite O
value O
as O
money O
-- O
it O
was O
an O
appreciable O
infringement O
on O
a O
day O
's O
wages O
, O
and O
, O
as O
such O
, O
a O
higgling O
matter O
; O
but O
twopence O
-- O
" O
Here O
. O
" O
he O
said O
, O
stepping O
forward O
and O
handing O
twopence O
to O
the O
gatekeeper O
; O
" O
let O
the O
young O
woman O
pass O
. O
" O
He O
looked O
up O
at O
her O
then O
; O
she O
heard O
his O
words O
, O
and O
looked O
down O
. O
Gabriel O
's O
features O
adhered O
throughout O
their O
form O
so O
exactly O
to O
the O
middle O
line O
between O
the O
beauty O
of O
St. O
John O
and O
the O
ugliness O
of O
Judas O
Iscariot O
, O
as O
represented O
in O
a O
window O
of O
the O
church O
he O
attended O
, O
that O
not O
a O
single O
lineament O
could O
be O
selected O
and O
called O
worthy O
either O
of O
distinction O
or O
notoriety O
. O
The O
redjacketed O
and O
dark O
- O
haired O
maiden O
seemed O
to O
think O
so O
too O
, O
for O
she O
carelessly O
glanced O
over O
him O
, O
and O
told O
her O
man O
to O
drive O
on O
. O
She O
might O
have O
looked O
her O
thanks O
to O
Gabriel O
on O
a O
minute O
scale O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
them O
; O
more O
probably O
she O
felt O
none O
, O
for O
in O
gaining O
her O
a O
passage O
he O
had O
lost O
her O
her O
point O
, O
and O
we O
know O
how O
women O
take O
a O
favour O
of O
that O
kind O
. O
The O
gatekeeper O
surveyed O
the O
retreating O
vehicle O
. O
" O
That O

a O
handsome O
maid O

he O
said O

Gabriel O
, O
perhaps O
a O
little O
piqued O
by O

glanced O
back O

CHAPTER O
I O
IN O
WHICH O
I PRON_PER
THROW O
AMBS-ACE O
THE O
work O
of O
the O
day O
being O
over O
, O
I PRON_PER
sat O
down O
upon O
my PRON_PER
doorstep O
, O
pipe O
in O
hand O
, O
to O
rest O
awhile O
in O
the O
cool O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
Death O
is O
not O
more O
still O
than O
is O
this O
Virginian O
land O
in O
the O
hour O
when O
the O
sun O
has O
sunk O
away O
, O
and O
it O
is O
black O
beneath O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
brighten O
slowly O
and O
softly O
, O
one O
by O
one O
. O
The O
birds O
that O
sing O
all O
day O
have O
hushed O
, O
and O
the O
horned O
owls O
, O
the O
monster O
frogs O
, O
and O
that O
strange O
and O
ominous O
fowl O
( O
if O
fowl O
it O
be O
, O
and O
not O
, O
as O
some NOM_PER
assert O
, O
a O
spirit O
damned O
) O
which O
we PRON_PER
English PROP_PER
call O
the O
whippoorwill O
, O
are O
yet O
silent O
. O
Later O
the O
wolf O
will O
howl O
and O
the O
panther O
scream O
, O
but O
now O
there O
is O
no O
sound O
. O
The O
winds O
are O
laid O
, O
and O
the O
restless O
leaves O
droop O
and O
are O
quiet O
. O
The O
low O
lap O
of O
the O
water O
among O
the O
reeds O
is O
like O
the O
breathing O
of O
one NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
sleeps NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
his NOM_PER
watch NOM_PER
beside NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
dead NOM_PER
. O
I O
marked O
the O
light O
die O
from O
the O
broad O
bosom O
of O
the O
river O
, O
leaving O
it O
a O
dead O
man O
's O
hue O
. O
Awhile O
ago O
, O
and O
for O
many O
evenings O
, O
it O
had O
been O
crimson O
, O
-- O
a O
river O
of O
blood O
. O
A O
week O
before O
, O
a O
great O
meteor O
had O
shot O
through O
the O
night O
, O
blood-red O
and O
bearded O
, O
drawing O
a O
slow-fading O
fiery O
trail O
across O
the O
heavens O
; O
and O
the O
moon O
had O
risen O
that O
same O
night O
blood-red O
, O
and O
upon O
its O
disk O
there O
was O
drawn O
in O
shadow O
a O
thing O
most O
marvelously O
like O
a O
scalping O
knife O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
the O
following O
day O
being O
Sunday O
, O
good O
Mr. O
Stockham O
, O
our O
minister O
at O
Weyanoke O
, O
exhorted O
us O
to O
be O
on O
our O
guard O
, O
and O
in O
his O
prayer O
besought O
that O
no O
sedition O
or O
rebellion O
might O
raise O
its O
head O
amongst O
the O
Indian O
subjects O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
anointed O
. O
Afterward O
, O
in O
the O
churchyard O
, O
between O
the O
services O
, O
the O
more O
timorous O
began O
to O
tell O
of O
divers O
portents O
which O
they O
had O
observed O
, O
and O
to O
recount O
old O
tales O
of O
how O
the O
savages O
distressed O
us O
in O
the O
Starving O
Time O
. O
The O
bolder O
spirits O
laughed O
them O
to O
scorn O
, O
but O
the O
women O
began O
to O
weep O
and O
cower O
, O
and O
I O
, O
though O
I O
laughed O
too O
, O
thought O
of O
Smith O
, O
and O
how O
he O
ever O
held O
the O
savages O
, O
and O
more O
especially O
that O
Opechancanough O
who O
was O
now O
their O
emperor O
, O
in O
a O
most O
deep O
distrust O
; O
telling O
us O
that O
the O
red O
men O
watched O
while O
we O
slept O
, O
that O
they O
might O
teach O
wiliness O
to O
a O
Jesuit O
, O
and O
how O
to O
bide O
its O
time O
to O
a O
cat O
crouched O
before O
a O
mousehole O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
terms O
we O
now O
kept O
with O
these O
heathen O
; O
of O
how O
they O
came O
and O
went O
familiarly O
amongst O
us O
, O
spying O
out O
our O
weakness O
, O
and O
losing O
the O
salutary O
awe O
which O
that O
noblest O
captain O
had O
struck O
into O
their O
souls O
; O
of O
how O
many O
were O
employed O
as O
hunters O
to O
bring O
down O
deer O
for O
lazy O
masters O
; O
of O
how O
, O
breaking O
the O
law O
, O
and O
that O
not O
secretly O
, O
we O
gave O
them O
knives O
and O
arms O
, O
a O
soldier O
's O
bread O
, O
in O
exchange O
for O
pelts O
and O
pearls O
; O
of O
how O
their O
emperor O
was O
forever O
sending O
us O
smooth O
messages O
; O
of O
how O
their O
lips O
smiled O
and O
their O
eyes O
frowned O
. O
That O
afternoon O
, O
as O
I O
rode O
home O
through O
the O
lengthening O
shadows O
, O
a O
hunter O
, O
red-brown O
and O
naked O
, O
rose O
from O
behind O
a O
fallen O
tree O
that O
sprawled O
across O
my O
path O
, O
and O
made O
offer O
to O
bring O
me O
my O
meat O
from O
the O
moon O
of O
corn O
to O
the O
moon O
of O
stags O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
gun O
. O
There O
was O
scant O
love O
between O
the O
savages O
and O
myself O
, O
-- O
it O
was O
answer O
enough O
when O
I O
told O
him O
my O
name O
. O
I O
left O
the O
dark O
figure O
standing O
, O
still O
as O
a O
carved O
stone O
, O
in O
the O
heavy O
shadow O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
, O
spurring O
my O
horse O
( O
sent O
me O
from O
home O
, O
the O
year O
before O
, O
by O
my O
cousin O
Percy O
) O
, O
was O
soon O
at O
my O
house O
, O
-- O
a O
poor O
and O
rude O
one O
, O
but O
pleasantly O
set O
upon O
a O
slope O
of O
green O
turf O
, O
and O
girt O
with O
maize O
and O
the O
broad O
leaves O
of O
the O
tobacco O
. O
When O
I O
had O
had O
my O
supper O
, O
I O
called O
from O
their O
hut O
the O
two O
Paspahegh O
lads O
bought O
by O
me O
from O
their O
tribe O
the O
Michaelmas O
before O
, O
and O
soundly O
flogged O
them O
both O
, O
having O
in O
my O
mind O
a O
saying O
of O
my O
ancient O
captain O
's O
, O
namely O
, O
" O
He O
who O
strikes O
first O
oft-times O
strikes O
last O
. O
" O
Upon O
the O
afternoon O
of O
which O
I O
now O
speak O
, O
in O
the O
midsummer O
of O
the O
year O
of O
grace O
1621 O
, O
as O
I O
sat O
upon O
my O
doorstep O
, O
my O
long O
pipe O
between O
my O
teeth O
and O
my O
eyes O
upon O
the O
pallid O
stream O
below O
, O
my O
thoughts O
were O
busy O
with O
these O
matters O
, O
-- O
so O
busy O
that O
I O
did O
not O
see O
a O
horse O
and O
rider O
emerge O
from O
the O
dimness O
of O
the O
forest O
into O
the O
cleared O
space O
before O
my O
palisade O
, O
nor O
knew O
, O
until O
his O
voice O
came O
up O
the O
bank O
, O
that O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
Master O
John O
Rolfe O
, O
was O
without O
and O
would O
speak O
to O
me O
. O
I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
gate O
, O
and O
, O
unbarring O
it O
, O
gave O
him O
my O
hand O
and O
led O
the O
horse O
within O
the O
inclosure O
. O
" O
Thou O
careful O
man O
! O
" O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
as O
he O
dismounted O
. O
" O
Who O
else O
, O
think O
you O
, O
in O
this O
or O
any O
other O
hundred O
, O
now O
bars O
his O
gate O
when O
the O
sun O
goes O
down O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
my O
sunset O
gun O
, O
" O
I O
answered O
briefly O
, O
fastening O
his O
horse O
as O
I O
spoke O
. O
He O
put O
his O
arm O
about O
my O
shoulder O
, O
for O
we O
were O
old O
friends O
, O
and O
together O
we O
went O
up O
the O
green O
bank O
to O
the O
house O
, O
and O
, O
when O
I O
had O
brought O
him O
a O
pipe O
, O
sat O
down O
side O
by O
side O
upon O
the O
doorstep O
. O
" O
Of O
what O
were O
you O
dreaming O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
presently O
, O
when O
we O
had O
made O
for O
ourselves O
a O
great O
cloud O
of O
smoke O
. O
" O
I O
called O
you O
twice O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
wishing O
for O
Dale O
's O
times O
and O
Dale O
's O
laws O
. O
" O
He O
laughed O
, O
and O
touched O
my O
knee O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
white O
and O
smooth O
as O
a O
woman O
's O
, O
and O
with O
a O
green O
jewel O
upon O
the O
forefinger O
. O
" O
Thou O
Mars O
incarnate O
! O
" O
he O
cried O
. O
" O
Thou O
first O
, O
last O
, O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
soldier O
! O
Why O
, O
what O
wilt O
thou O
do O
when O
thou O
gettest O
to O
heaven O
? O
Make O
it O
too O
hot O
to O
hold O
thee O
? O
Or O
take O
out O
letters O
of O
marque O
against O
the O
Enemy O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
there O
yet O
, O
" O
I O
said O
dryly O
. O
" O
In O
the O
meantime O
I O
would O
like O
a O
commission O
against O
-- O
your O
relatives O
. O
" O
He O
laughed O
, O
then O
sighed O
, O
and O
, O
sinking O
his O
chin O
into O
his O
hand O
and O
softly O
tapping O
his O
foot O
against O
the O
ground O
, O
fell O
into O
a O
reverie O
. O
" O
I O
would O
your O
princess O
were O
alive O
, O
" O
I O
said O
presently O
. O
" O
So O
do O
I O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
softly O
. O
" O
So O
do O
I. O
" O
Locking O
his O
hands O
behind O
his O
head O
, O
he O
raised O
his O
quiet O
face O
to O
the O
evening O
star O
. O
" O
Brave O
and O
wise O
and O
gentle O
, O
" O
he O
mused O
. O
" O
If O
I O
did O
not O
think O
to O
meet O
her O
again O
, O
beyond O
that O
star O
, O
I O
could O
not O
smile O
and O
speak O
calmly O
, O
Ralph O
, O
as O
I O
do O
now O
. O
" O
" O
' O
T O
is O
a O
strange O
thing O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
as O
I O
refilled O
my O
pipe O
. O
" O
Love O
for O
your O
brother-in-arms O
, O
love O
for O

for O
your O

I O
understand O

But O
wedded O

to O
tie O
a O
burden O
around O

is O

shaped O
with O

! O
" O
" O
Yet O
I O
came O
with O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
persuade O
thee O
to O
that O
very O
burden O
! O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
with O
another O
laugh O
. O
" O
Thanks O
for O
thy O
pains O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
blowing O
blue O
rings O
into O
the O
air O
. O
" O
I O
have O
ridden O
to-day O
from O
Jamestown O
, O
" O
he O
went O
on O
. O
" O
I O
was O
the O
only O
man O
, O
i O
' O
faith O
, O
that O
cared O
to O
leave O
its O
gates O
; O
and O
I O
met O
the O
world O
-- O
the O
bachelor O
world O
-- O
flocking O
to O
them O
. O
Not O
a O
mile O
of O
the O
way O
but O
I O
encountered O
Tom O
, O
Dick O
, O
and O
Harry O
, O
dressed O
in O
their O
Sunday O
bravery O
and O
making O
full O
tilt O
for O
the O
city O

And O
the O
boats O
upon O
the O
river O
! O
I O
have O
seen O
the O
Thames O
less O
crowded O
. O
" O
" O
There O
was O
more O
passing O
than O
usual O
, O
" O
I O
said O
; O
" O
but O
I O
was O
busy O
in O
the O
fields O
, O
and O
did O
not O
attend O
. O
What O
's O
the O
lodestar O
? O
" O
" O
The O
star O
that O
draws O
us O
all O

some O
to O

woman O

" O
" O
Humph O
! O
The O
maids O
have O
come O
, O
then O
? O
" O
He O
nodded O
. O
" O
There O
's O
a O
goodly O
ship O
down O
there O
, O
with O
a O
goodly O
lading O
. O
" O
" O
Videlicet O
, O
some O
fourscore O
waiting O
damsels O

milkmaids O
, O
warranted O
honest O
by O
my O
Lord O
Warwick O
, O
" O
I O
muttered O

" O

business O
hath O
been O
of O
Edwyn O
Sandys O
' O
management O
, O
as O
you O
very O
well O
know O

" O
he O
rejoined O
, O
with O
some O
heat O
. O
" O
His O
word O
is O
good O
: O
therefore O
I O
hold O
them O
chaste O

That O
they O
are O
fair O
I O
can O
testify O

having O
seen O
them O
leave O
the O

said O
, O
" O

meanly O
born O

" O
" O
I O
grant O
you O
that O

" O
he O
answered O

" O
But O
after O
all O
, O
what O
of O
it O
? O
Beggars O
must O
not O
be O
choosers O
. O
The O
land O
is O
new O
and O
must O
be O
peopled O
, O
nor O
will O
those O
who O
come O
after O
us O
look O
too O
curiously O
into O
the O
lineage O
of O
those O
to O
whom O
a O
nation O
owes O
its O
birth O
. O
What O
we O
in O
these O
plantations O
need O
is O
a O
loosening O
of O
the O
bonds O
which O
tie O
us O
to O
home O
, O
to O
England O
, O
and O
a O
tightening O
of O
those O
which O
bind O
us O
to O
this O
land O
in O
which O
we O
have O
cast O
our O
lot O
. O
We O
put O
our O
hand O
to O
the O
plough O
, O
but O
we O
turn O
our O
heads O
and O
look O
to O
our O
Egypt O

its O
fleshpots O

that O

that O

a O
man O

chains O
of O
gold O
to O
the O
country O

they O
abide O

Wherefore O
, O
when O
at O
midday O
I O
met O
good O
Master O

rowing O
down O
from O
Henricus O
to O
Jamestown O
, O
to O
offer O
his O
aid O
to O
Master O

in O
his O
press O
of O

I O
gave O
the O
good O
man O
Godspeed O
, O

thought O
his O
a O
fruitful O

one O
pleasing O

the O

" O

He O
rose O
to O
his O
feet O

began O
to O
pace O
the O
greensward O
before O
the O
door O

My O
eyes O
followed O
his O
trim O
figure O

richly O

sombrely O
clad O

fell O
with O
a O
sudden O
dissatisfaction O
upon O
my O

THE NOM_PER
SISTERS NOM_PER
There O
was O
no O
hope O
for O
him PRON_PER
this O
time O
: O
it O
was O
the O
third O
stroke O
. O
Night O
after O
night O
I PRON_PER
had O
passed O
the O
house O
( O
it O
was O
vacation O
time O
) O
and O
studied O
the O
lighted O
square O
of O
window O
: O
and O
night O
after O
night O
I PRON_PER
had O
found O
it O
lighted O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
faintly O
and O
evenly O
. O
If O
he PRON_PER
was O
dead O
, O
I PRON_PER
thought O
, O
I PRON_PER
would O
see O
the O
reflection O
of O
candles O
on O
the O
darkened O
blind O
for O
I PRON_PER
knew O
that O
two O
candles O
must O
be O
set O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a NOM_PER
corpse NOM_PER

He PRON_PER
had O
often O
said O
to O
me PRON_PER
: O
" O
I PRON_PER
am O
not O
long O
for O
this O
world O

" O
and O
I PRON_PER
had O
thought O
his PRON_PER
words O
idle O
. O
Now O
I PRON_PER
knew O
they O
were O
true O
. O
Every O
night O
as O
I PRON_PER
gazed O
up O
at O
the O
window O
I PRON_PER
said O
softly O
to O
myself PRON_PER
the O
word O
paralysis O
. O
It O
had O
always O
sounded O
strangely O
in O
my PRON_PER
ears O
, O
like O
the O
word O
gnomon O
in O
the O
Euclid PROP_PER
and O
the O
word O
simony O
in O
the O
Catechism O
. O
But O
now O
it O
sounded O
to O
me PRON_PER
like O
the O
name O
of O
some NOM_PER
maleficent NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
sinful NOM_PER
being NOM_PER
. O
It O
filled O
me PRON_PER
with O
fear O
, O
and O
yet O
I PRON_PER
longed O
to O
be O
nearer O
to O
it O
and O
to O
look O
upon O
its O
deadly O
work O
. O
Old PROP_PER
Cotter PROP_PER
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
fire O

when O
I PRON_PER
came O
downstairs O
to O
supper O

While O
my NOM_PER
aunt NOM_PER
was O
ladling O
out O
my O
stirabout O
he O
said O

as O
if O
returning O
to O
some O
former O
remark O
of O
his O
: O
" O
No O
, O
I O
would O
n’t O
say O
he O
was O
exactly O

there O
was O
something O
queer O

there O
was O
something O
uncanny O
about O
him O

I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
my O
opinion O

" O
He O
began O
to O
puff O
at O
his O
pipe O

no O
doubt O
arranging O
his O
opinion O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
Tiresome O
old O
fool O
! O
When O
we O
knew O
him O
first O
he O
used O
to O
be O
rather O
interesting O
, O
talking O
of O
faints O
and O
worms O
; O
but O
I O
soon O
grew O
tired O
of O
him O

his O
endless O
stories O
about O
the O
distillery O

" O
I O
have O
my O
own O
theory O
about O
it O

I O
think O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those O

peculiar O
cases O

it O

hard O

puff O
again O

saw O
me O
staring O
and O
said O
to O
me O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
so O
your O
old O
friend O
is O
gone O
, O
you O
’ll O
be O
sorry O
to O
hear O
. O
" O
" O
Who O
? O
" O
said O
I. O
" O
Father O
Flynn O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
he O
dead O
? O
" O
" O
Mr O
Cotter O
here O
has O
just O
told O
us O
. O
He O
was O
passing O
by O
the O
house O
. O
" O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
under O
observation O
so O
I O
continued O
eating O
as O
if O
the O
news O
had O
not O
interested O
me O
. O
My O
uncle O
explained O
to O
old O
Cotter O
. O
" O
The O
youngster O
and O
he O
were O
great O
friends O
. O
The O
old O
chap O
taught O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
mind O
you O
; O
and O
they O
say O
he O
had O
a O
great O
wish O
for O
him O
. O
" O
" O
God O
have O
mercy O
on O
his O
soul O
, O
" O
said O
my O
aunt O
piously O
. O
Old O
Cotter O
looked O
at O
me O
for O
a O
while O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
his O
little O
beady O
black O
eyes O
were O
examining O
me O
but O
I O
would O
not O
satisfy O
him O
by O
looking O
up O
from O
my O
plate O
. O
He O
returned O
to O
his O
pipe O
and O
finally O
spat O
rudely O
into O
the O
grate O
. O
" O
I O
would O
n’t O
like O
children O
of O
mine O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
to O
have O
too O
much O
to O
say O
to O
a O
man O
like O
that O
. O
" O
" O
How O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Mr O
Cotter O
? O
" O
asked O
my O
aunt O
. O
" O
What O
I O
mean O
is O
, O
" O
said O
old O
Cotter O
, O
" O
it O
’s O
bad O
for O
children O
. O
My O
idea O
is O
: O
let O
a O
young O
lad O
run O
about O
and O
play O
with O
young O
lads O
of O
his O
own O
age O
and O
not O
be O
... O
. O
Am O
I O
right O
, O
Jack O
? O
" O
" O
That O
’s O
my O
principle O
, O
too O
, O
" O
said O
my O
uncle O
. O
" O
Let O
him O
learn O
to O
box O
his O
corner O
. O
That O
’s O
what O
I O
’m O
always O
saying O
to O
that O
Rosicrucian O
there O
: O
take O
exercise O
. O
Why O
, O
when O
I O
was O
a O
nipper O
every O
morning O
of O
my O
life O
I O
had O
a O
cold O
bath O
, O
winter O
and O
summer O
. O
And O
that O
’s O
what O
stands O
to O
me O
now O
. O
Education O
is O
all O
very O
fine O
and O
large O
... O
. O
Mr O
Cotter O
might O
take O
a O
pick O
of O
that O
leg O
mutton O
, O
" O
he O
added O
to O
my O
aunt O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
not O
for O
me O
, O
" O
said O
old O
Cotter O
. O
My O
aunt O
brought O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
safe O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
table O
. O
" O
But O
why O
do O
you O
think O
it O
’s O
not O
good O
for O
children O
, O
Mr O
Cotter O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
. O
" O
It O
’s O
bad O
for O
children O
, O
" O
said O
old O
Cotter O
, O
" O
because O
their O
minds O
are O
so O
impressionable O
. O
When O
children O
see O
things O
like O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
has O
an O
effect O
.... O
" O
I O
crammed O
my O
mouth O
with O
stirabout O
for O
fear O
I O
might O
give O
utterance O
to O
my O
anger O
. O
Tiresome O
old O
red-nosed O
imbecile O
! O
It O
was O
late O
when O
I O
fell O
asleep O
. O
Though O
I O
was O
angry O
with O
old O
Cotter O
for O
alluding O
to O
me O
as O
a O
child O
, O
I O
puzzled O
my O
head O
to O
extract O
meaning O
from O
his O
unfinished O
sentences O
. O
In O
the O
dark O
of O
my O
room O
I O
imagined O
that O
I O
saw O
again O
the O
heavy O
grey O
face O
of O
the O
paralytic O
. O
I O
drew O
the O
blankets O
over O
my O
head O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
Christmas O
. O
But O
the O
grey O
face O
still O
followed O
me O
. O
It O
murmured O
; O
and O
I O
understood O
that O
it O
desired O
to O
confess O
something O
. O
I O
felt O
my O
soul O
receding O
into O
some O
pleasant O
and O
vicious O
region O
; O
and O
there O
again O
I O
found O
it O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O
It O
began O
to O
confess O
to O
me O
in O
a O
murmuring O
voice O
and O
I O
wondered O
why O
it O
smiled O
continually O
and O
why O
the O
lips O
were O
so O
moist O
with O
spittle O
. O
But O
then O
I O
remembered O
that O
it O
had O
died O
of O
paralysis O
and O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
too O
was O
smiling O
feebly O
as O
if O
to O
absolve O
the O
simoniac O
of O
his O
sin O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
after O
breakfast O
I O
went O
down O
to O
look O
at O
the O
little O
house O
in O
Great O
Britain O
Street O
. O
It O
was O
an O
unassuming O
shop O
, O
registered O
under O
the O
vague O
name O
of O
Drapery O
. O
The O
drapery O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
children O
’s O
bootees O
and O
umbrellas O
; O
and O
on O
ordinary O
days O
a O
notice O
used O
to O
hang O
in O
the O
window O
, O
saying O
: O
Umbrellas O
Re-covered O
. O
No O
notice O
was O
visible O
now O
for O
the O
shutters O
were O
up O
. O
A O
crape O
bouquet O
was O
tied O
to O
the O
door-knocker O
with O
ribbon O
. O
Two O
poor O
women O
and O
a O
telegram O
boy O
were O
reading O
the O
card O
pinned O
on O
the O
crape O
. O
I O
also O
approached O
and O
read O
: O
July O
1st O
, O
1895 O
The O
Rev. O
James O
Flynn O
( O
formerly O
of O
S. O
Catherine O
’s O
Church O
, O
Meath O
Street O
) O
, O
aged O
sixty-five O
years O
. O
R. O
I. O
P O
. O
The O
reading O
of O
the O
card O
persuaded O
me O
that O
he O
was O
dead O
and O
I O
was O
disturbed O
to O
find O
myself O
at O
check O
. O
Had O
he O
not O
been O
dead O
I O
would O
have O
gone O
into O
the O
little O
dark O
room O
behind O
the O
shop O
to O
find O
him O
sitting O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
nearly O
smothered O
in O
his O
great-coat O
. O
Perhaps O
my O
aunt O
would O
have O
given O
me O
a O
packet O
of O
High O
Toast O
for O
him O
and O
this O
present O
would O
have O
roused O
him O
from O
his O
stupefied O
doze O
. O
It O
was O
always O
I O
who O
emptied O
the O
packet O
into O
his O
black O
snuff-box O
for O
his O
hands O
trembled O
too O
much O
to O
allow O
him O
to O
do O
this O
without O
spilling O
half O
the O
snuff O
about O
the O
floor O
. O
Even O
as O
he O
raised O
his O
large O
trembling O
hand O
to O
his O
nose O
little O
clouds O
of O
smoke O
dribbled O
through O
his O
fingers O
over O
the O
front O
of O
his O
coat O
. O
It O
may O
have O
been O
these O
constant O
showers O
of O
snuff O
which O
gave O
his O
ancient O
priestly O
garments O
their O
green O
faded O
look O
for O
the O
red O
handkerchief O
, O
blackened O
, O
as O
it O
always O
was O
, O
with O
the O
snuff-stains O
of O
a O
week O
, O
with O
which O
he O
tried O
to O
brush O
away O
the O
fallen O
grains O
, O
was O
quite O
inefficacious O
. O
I O
wished O
to O
go O
in O
and O
look O
at O
him O
but O
I O
had O
not O
the O
courage O
to O
knock O
. O
I O
walked O
away O
slowly O
along O
the O
sunny O
side O
of O
the O
street O
, O
reading O
all O
the O
theatrical O
advertisements O
in O
the O
shop-windows O
as O
I O
went O
. O
I O
found O
it O
strange O
that O
neither O
I O
nor O
the O
day O
seemed O
in O
a O
mourning O
mood O
and O
I O
felt O
even O
annoyed O
at O
discovering O
in O
myself O
a O
sensation O
of O
freedom O
as O
if O
I O
had O
been O
freed O
from O
something O
by O
his O
death O
. O
I O
wondered O
at O
this O
for O
, O
as O
my O
uncle O
had O
said O
the O
night O
before O
, O
he O
had O
taught O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
He O
had O
studied O
in O
the O
Irish O
college O
in O
Rome O
and O
he O
had O
taught O
me O
to O
pronounce O
Latin O
properly O
. O
He O
had O
told O
me O
stories O
about O
the O
catacombs O
and O
about O
Napoleon O
Bonaparte O
, O
and O
he O
had O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
different O
ceremonies O
of O
the O
Mass O
and O
of O
the O
different O
vestments O
worn O
by O
the O
priest O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
had O
amused O
himself O
by O
putting O
difficult O
questions O
to O
me O
, O
asking O
me O
what O
one O
should O
do O
in O
certain O
circumstances O
or O
whether O
such O
and O
such O
sins O
were O
mortal O
or O
venial O
or O
only O
imperfections O
. O
His O
questions O
showed O
me O
how O
complex O
and O
mysterious O
were O
certain O
institutions O
of O
the O
Church O
which O
I O
had O
always O
regarded O
as O
the O
simplest O
acts O
. O
The O
duties O
of O
the O
priest O
towards O
the O
Eucharist O
and O
towards O
the O
secrecy O
of O
the O
confessional O
seemed O
so O
grave O
to O
me O
that O
I O
wondered O
how O
anybody O
had O
ever O
found O
in O
himself O
the O
courage O
to O
undertake O
them O
; O
and O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
when O
he O
told O
me O
that O
the O
fathers O
of O
the O
Church O
had O
written O
books O
as O
thick O
as O
the O
Post O
Office O
Directory O
and O
as O
closely O
printed O
as O
the O
law O
notices O
in O
the O
newspaper O
, O
elucidating O
all O
these O
intricate O
questions O
. O
Often O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
this O
I O
could O
make O
no O
answer O
or O
only O
a O
very O
foolish O
and O
halting O
one O
upon O
which O
he O
used O
to O
smile O
and O
nod O
his O
head O
twice O
or O
thrice O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
used O
to O
put O
me O
through O
the O
responses O
of O
the O
Mass O
which O
he O
had O
made O
me O
learn O
by O
heart O
; O
and O
, O
as O
I O
pattered O
, O
he O
used O
to O
smile O
pensively O
and O
nod O
his O
head O
, O
now O
and O
then O
pushing O
huge O
pinches O
of O
snuff O
up O
each O
nostril O
alternately O
. O
When O
he O
smiled O
he O
used O
to O
uncover O
his O
big O
discoloured O
teeth O
and O
let O
his O
tongue O
lie O
upon O
his O
lower O
lip O
— O
a O
habit O
which O
had O
made O
me O
feel O
uneasy O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
before O
I O
knew O
him O
well O
. O
As O
I O
walked O
along O
in O
the O
sun O
I O
remembered O
old O
Cotter O
’s O
words O
and O
tried O
to O
remember O
what O
had O
happened O
afterwards O
in O
the O
dream O
. O
I O
remembered O
that O
I O
had O
noticed O
long O
velvet O
curtains O
and O
a O
swinging O
lamp O
of O
antique O
fashion O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
had O
been O
very O
far O
away O
, O
in O
some O
land O
where O
the O
customs O
were O
strange O
— O
in O
Persia O
, O
I O
thought O
... O
. O
But O
I O
could O
not O
remember O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dream O
. O
In O
the O
evening O
my O
aunt O
took O
me O
with O
her O
to O
visit O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
. O
It O
was O
after O
sunset O
; O
but O
the O
window-panes O
of O
the O
houses O
that O
looked O
to O
the O
west O
reflected O
the O
tawny O
gold O
of O
a O
great O
bank O
of O
clouds O
. O
Nannie O
received O
us O
in O
the O
hall O
; O
and O
, O
as O
it O
would O
have O
been O
unseemly O
to O
have O
shouted O
at O
her O
, O
my O
aunt O
shook O
hands O
with O
her O
for O
all O
. O
The O
old O
woman O
pointed O
upwards O
interrogatively O
and O
, O
on O
my O
aunt O
’s O
nodding O
, O
proceeded O
to O
toil O
up O
the O
narrow O
staircase O
before O
us O
, O
her O
bowed O
head O
being O
scarcely O
above O
the O
level O
of O
the O
banister-rail O
. O
At O
the O
first O
landing O
she O
stopped O
and O
beckoned O
us O
forward O
encouragingly O
towards O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the O
dead-room O
. O
My O
aunt O
went O
in O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
hesitated O
to O
enter O
, O
began O
to O
beckon O
to O
me O
again O
repeatedly O
with O
her O
hand O
. O

handsome O
one O
has O
been O
so O
knocked O
about O
that O
I O
can O
hardly O
imagine O
a O
town O
practitioner O
carrying O
it O
. O
The O
thick-iron O
ferrule O
is O
worn O
down O
, O
so O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
he O
has O
done O
a O
great O
amount O
of O
walking O
with O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Perfectly O
sound O
! O
" O
said O
Holmes O
. O
" O
And O
then O
again O
, O
there O
is O
the O
‘ O
friends O
of O
the O
C.C.H. O
’ O
I O
should O
guess O
that O
to O
be O
the O
Something O
Hunt O
, O
the O
local O
hunt O
to O
whose O
members O
he O
has O
possibly O
given O
some O
surgical O
assistance O
, O
and O
which O
has O
made O
him O
a O
small O
presentation O
in O
return O
. O
" O
" O
Really O
, O
Watson O
, O
you O
excel O
yourself O
, O
" O
said O
Holmes O
, O
pushing O
back O
his O
chair O
and O
lighting O
a O
cigarette O
. O
" O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
say O
that O
in O
all O
the O
accounts O
which O
you O
have O
been O
so O
good O
as O
to O
give O
of O
my O
own O
small O
achievements O
you O
have O
habitually O
underrated O
your O
own O
abilities O
. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
you O
are O
not O
yourself O
luminous O
, O
but O
you O
are O
a O
conductor O
of O
light O
. O
Some O
people O
without O
possessing O
genius O
have O
a O
remarkable O
power O
of O
stimulating O
it O
. O
I O
confess O
, O
my O
dear O
fellow O
, O
that O
I O
am O
very O
much O
in O
your O
debt O
. O
" O
He O
had O
never O
said O
as O
much O
before O
, O
and O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
his O
words O
gave O
me O
keen O
pleasure O
, O
for O
I O
had O
often O
been O
piqued O
by O
his O
indifference O
to O
my O
admiration O
and O
to O
the O
attempts O
which O
I O
had O
made O
to O
give O
publicity O
to O
his O
methods O
. O
I O
was O
proud O
, O
too O
, O
to O
think O
that O
I O
had O
so O
far O
mastered O
his O
system O
as O
to O
apply O
it O
in O
a O
way O
which O
earned O
his O
approval O
. O
He O
now O
took O
the O
stick O
from O
my O
hands O
and O
examined O
it O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
with O
his O
naked O
eyes O
. O
Then O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
interest O
he O
laid O
down O
his O
cigarette O
, O
and O
carrying O
the O
cane O
to O
the O
window O
, O
he O
looked O
over O
it O
again O
with O
a O
convex O
lens O
. O
" O
Interesting O
, O
though O
elementary O
, O
" O
said O
he O
as O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
favourite O
corner O
of O
the O
settee O
. O
" O
There O
are O
certainly O
one O
or O
two O
indications O
upon O
the O
stick O
. O
It O
gives O
us O
the O
basis O
for O
several O
deductions O
. O
" O
" O
Has O
anything O
escaped O
me O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
with O
some O
self-importance O
. O
" O
I O
trust O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
of O
consequence O
which O
I O
have O
overlooked O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
, O
my O
dear O
Watson O
, O
that O
most O
of O
your O
conclusions O
were O
erroneous O
. O
When O
I O
said O
that O
you O
stimulated O
me O
I O
meant O
, O
to O
be O
frank O
, O
that O
in O
noting O
your O
fallacies O
I O
was O
occasionally O
guided O
towards O
the O
truth O
. O
Not O
that O
you O
are O
entirely O
wrong O
in O
this O
instance O
. O
The O
man O
is O
certainly O
a O
country O
practitioner O
. O
And O
he O
walks O
a O
good O
deal O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
I O
was O
right O
. O
" O
" O
To O
that O
extent O
. O
" O
" O
But O
that O
was O
all O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
dear O
Watson O
, O
not O
all O
-- O
by O
no O
means O
all O
. O
I O
would O
suggest O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
a O
presentation O
to O
a O
doctor O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
a O
hospital O
than O
from O
a O
hunt O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
initials O
‘ O
C.C. O
’ O
are O
placed O
before O
that O
hospital O
the O
words O
‘ O
Charing O
Cross O
’ O
very O
naturally O
suggest O
themselves O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
be O
right O
. O
" O
" O
The O
probability O
lies O
in O
that O
direction O
. O
And O
if O
we O
take O
this O
as O
a O
working O
hypothesis O
we O
have O
a O
fresh O
basis O
from O
which O
to O
start O
our O
construction O
of O
this O
unknown O
visitor O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
supposing O
that O
‘ O
C.C.H. O
’ O
does O
stand O
for O
‘ O
Charing O
Cross O
Hospital O
, O
’ O
what O
further O
inferences O
may O
we O
draw O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
none O
suggest O
themselves O
? O
You O
know O
my O
methods O
. O
Apply O
them O
! O
" O
" O
I O
can O
only O
think O
of O
the O
obvious O
conclusion O
that O
the O
man O
has O
practised O
in O
town O
before O
going O
to O
the O
country O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
that O
we O
might O
venture O
a O
little O
farther O
than O
this O
. O
Look O
at O
it O
in O
this O
light O
. O
On O
what O
occasion O
would O
it O
be O
most O
probable O
that O
such O
a O
presentation O
would O
be O
made O
? O
When O
would O
his O
friends O
unite O
to O
give O
him O
a O
pledge O
of O
their O
good O
will O
? O
Obviously O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
Dr. O
Mortimer O
withdrew O
from O
the O
service O
of O
the O
hospital O
in O
order O
to O
start O
a O
practice O
for O
himself O
. O
We O
know O
there O
has O
been O
a O
presentation O
. O
We O
believe O
there O
has O
been O
a O
change O
from O
a O
town O
hospital O
to O
a O
country O
practice O
. O
Is O
it O
, O
then O
, O
stretching O
our O
inference O
too O
far O
to O
say O
that O
the O
presentation O
was O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
change O
? O
" O
" O
It O
certainly O
seems O
probable O
. O
" O
" O
Now O
, O
you O
will O
observe O
that O
he O
could O
not O
have O
been O
on O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
hospital O
, O
since O
only O
a O
man O
well-established O
in O
a O
London O
practice O
could O
hold O
such O
a O
position O
, O
and O
such O
a O
one O
would O
not O
drift O
into O
the O
country O
. O
What O
was O
he O
, O
then O
? O
If O
he O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
yet O
not O
on O
the O
staff O
he O
could O
only O
have O
been O
a O
house-surgeon O
or O
a O
house-physician O
-- O
little O
more O
than O
a O
senior O
student O
. O
And O
he O
left O
five O
years O
ago O
-- O
the O
date O
is O
on O
the O
stick O
. O
So O
your O
grave O
, O
middle-aged O
family O
practitioner O
vanishes O
into O
thin O
air O
, O
my O
dear O
Watson O
, O
and O
there O
emerges O
a O
young O
fellow O
under O
thirty O
, O
amiable O
, O
unambitious O
, O
absent-minded O
, O
and O
the O
possessor O
of O
a O
favourite O
dog O
, O
which O
I O
should O
describe O
roughly O
as O
being O
larger O
than O
a O
terrier O
and O
smaller O
than O
a O
mastiff O
. O
" O
I O
laughed O
incredulously O
as O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
leaned O
back O
in O
his O
settee O
and O
blew O
little O
wavering O
rings O
of O
smoke O
up O
to O
the O
ceiling O
. O
" O
As O
to O
the O
latter O
part O
, O
I O
have O
no O
means O
of O
checking O
you O

" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
but O
at O

it O
is O
not O
difficult O
to O
find O
out O
a O
few O
particulars O
about O
the O

age O

career O

I O
took O
down O

up O
the O

were O
several O

man O

only O
an O

the O

" O
Has O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
carrying O
this O
stick O
behind O
his O
master O

Being O
a O
heavy O
stick O
the O
dog O
has O
held O
it O
tightly O
by O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
the O
marks O
of O

The O
dog O

as O

is O
too O
broad O
in O
my O
opinion O
for O
a O

not O
broad O
enough O
for O
a O
mastiff O

It O
may O

been O

he O
halted O

such O
a O
ring O

appearance O

visitor O

a O
surprise O
to O
me O

since O
I O
had O
expected O
a O
typical O
country O

was O
a O
very O
tall O
, O
thin O
man O
, O
with O
a O
long O
nose O
like O
a O
beak O
, O
which O
jutted O
out O
between O
two O
keen O
, O
gray O
eyes O
, O
set O
closely O
together O
and O
sparkling O
brightly O
from O
behind O
a O
pair O
of O
gold-rimmed O
glasses O

He O
was O
clad O
in O
a O
professional O
but O
rather O
slovenly O
fashion O
, O
for O
his O
frock-coat O
was O
dingy O
and O
his O
trousers O
frayed O
. O
Though O
young O
, O
his O
long O
back O
was O
already O
bowed O
, O
and O
he O
walked O
with O
a O
forward O
thrust O
of O
his O
head O
and O
a O
general O
air O
of O
peering O
benevolence O
. O
As O
he O
entered O
his O
eyes O
fell O
upon O
the O
stick O
in O
Holmes O
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
he O
ran O
towards O
it O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
joy O
. O
" O
I O
am O
so O
very O
glad O

he O

I O
was O

I O

know O
train O
later O
. O
They O
are O
as O
angry O
as O
I O
am O
that O
you O
did O
not O
come O
too O
; O
really O
Tibby O
is O
too O
tiresome O
, O
he O
starts O
a O
new O
mortal O
disease O
every O
month O
. O
How O
could O
he O
have O
got O
hay O
fever O
in O
London O
? O
and O
even O
if O
he O
could O
, O
it O
seems O
hard O
that O
you O
should O
give O
up O
a O
visit O
to O
hear O
a O
schoolboy O
sneeze O
. O
Tell O
him O
that O
Charles O
Wilcox O
( O
the O
son O
who O
is O
here O
) O
has O
hay O
fever O
too O
, O
but O
he O
's O
brave O
, O
and O
gets O
quite O
cross O
when O
we O
inquire O
after O
it O
. O
Men O
like O
the O
Wilcoxes O
would O
do O
Tibby O
a O
power O
of O
good O
. O
But O
you O
wo O
n't O
agree O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
better O
change O
the O
subject O
. O
This O
long O
letter O
is O
because O
I O
'm O
writing O
before O
breakfast O
. O
Oh O
, O
the O
beautiful O
vine O
leaves O
! O
The O
house O
is O
covered O
with O
a O
vine O
. O
I O
looked O
out O
earlier O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Wilcox O
was O
already O
in O
the O
garden O
. O
She O
evidently O
loves O
it O
. O
No O
wonder O
she O
sometimes O
looks O
tired O
. O
She O
was O
watching O
the O
large O
red O
poppies O
come O
out O
. O
Then O
she O
walked O
off O
the O
lawn O
to O
the O
meadow O
, O
whose O
corner O
to O
the O
right O
I O
can O
just O
see O
. O
Trail O
, O
trail O
, O
went O
her O
long O
dress O
over O
the O
sopping O
grass O
, O
and O
she O
came O
back O
with O
her O
hands O
full O
of O
the O
hay O
that O
was O
cut O
yesterday O
-- O
I O
suppose O
for O
rabbits O
or O
something O
, O
as O
she O
kept O
on O
smelling O
it O
. O
The O
air O
here O
is O
delicious O
. O
Later O
on O
I O
heard O
the O
noise O
of O
croquet O
balls O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
again O
, O
and O
it O
was O
Charles O
Wilcox O
practising O
; O
they O
are O
keen O
on O
all O
games O
. O
Presently O
he O
started O
sneezing O
and O
had O
to O
stop O
. O
Then O
I O
hear O
more O
clicketing O
, O
and O
it O
is O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
practising O
, O
and O
then O
, O
' O
a-tissue O
, O
a-tissue O
' O
: O
he O
has O
to O
stop O
too O
. O
Then O
Evie O
comes O
out O
, O
and O
does O
some O
calisthenic O
exercises O
on O
a O
machine O
that O
is O
tacked O
on O
to O
a O
greengage-tree O
-- O
they O
put O
everything O
to O
use O
-- O
and O
then O
she O
says O
' O
a-tissue O
, O
' O
and O
in O
she O
goes O
. O
And O
finally O
Mrs. O
Wilcox O
reappears O
, O
trail O
, O
trail O
, O
still O
smelling O
hay O
and O
looking O
at O
the O
flowers O
. O
I O
inflict O
all O
this O
on O
you O
because O
once O
you O
said O
that O
life O
is O
sometimes O
life O
and O
sometimes O
only O
a O
drama O
, O
and O
one O
must O
learn O
to O
distinguish O
t O
' O
other O
from O
which O
, O
and O
up O
to O
now O
I O
have O
always O
put O
that O
down O
as O
' O
Meg O
's O
clever O
nonsense O
. O
' O
But O
this O
morning O
, O
it O
really O
does O
seem O
not O
life O
but O
a O
play O
, O
and O
it O
did O
amuse O
me O
enormously O
to O
watch O
the O
W O
's O
. O
Now O
Mrs. O
Wilcox O
has O
come O
in O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
wear O
[ O
omission O
] O
. O
Last O
night O
Mrs. O
Wilcox O
wore O
an O
[ O
omission O
] O
, O
and O
Evie O
[ O
omission O
] O
. O
So O
it O
is O
n't O
exactly O
a O
go-as-you-please O
place O
, O
and O
if O
you O
shut O
your O
eyes O
it O
still O
seems O
the O
wiggly O
hotel O
that O
we O
expected O
. O
Not O
if O
you O
open O
them O
. O
The O
dog-roses O
are O
too O
sweet O
. O
There O
is O
a O
great O
hedge O
of O
them O
over O
the O
lawn O
-- O
magnificently O
tall O
, O
so O
that O
they O
fall O
down O
in O
garlands O
, O
and O
nice O
and O
thin O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
see O
ducks O
through O
it O
and O
a O
cow O
. O
These O
belong O
to O
the O
farm O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
house O
near O
us O
. O
There O
goes O
the O
breakfast O
gong O
. O
Much O
love O
. O
Modified O
love O
to O
Tibby O
. O
Love O
to O
Aunt O
Juley O
; O
how O
good O
of O
her O
to O
come O
and O
keep O
you O

FRIDAY O

Dearest O
Meg O
, O
I O
am O
having O
a O
glorious O
time O
. O
I O
like O
them O
all O
. O
Mrs. O
Wilcox O
, O
if O
quieter O
than O
in O
Germany O
, O
is O
sweeter O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
anything O
like O
her O
steady O
unselfishness O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
it O
is O
that O
the O
others O
do O
not O
take O
advantage O
of O
her O
. O
They O
are O
the O
very O
happiest O
, O
jolliest O
family O
that O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O
I O
do O
really O
feel O
that O
we O
are O
making O
friends O
. O
The O
fun O
of O
it O
is O
that O
they O
think O
me O
a O
noodle O
, O
and O
say O
so O
-- O
at O
least O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
does O
-- O
and O
when O
that O
happens O
, O
and O
one O
does O
n't O
mind O
, O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
sure O
test O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O
He O
says O
the O
most O
horrid O
things O
about O
women O
's O
suffrage O
so O
nicely O
, O
and O
when O
I O
said O
I O
believed O
in O
equality O
he O
just O
folded O
his O
arms O
and O
gave O
me O
such O
a O
setting O
down O
as O
I O
've O
never O
had O
. O
Meg O
, O
shall O
we O
ever O
learn O
to O
talk O
less O
? O
I O
never O
felt O
so O
ashamed O
of O
myself O
in O
my O
life O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
point O
to O
a O
time O
when O
men O
had O
been O
equal O
, O
nor O
even O
to O
a O
time O
when O
the O
wish O
to O
be O
equal O
had O
made O
them O
happier O
in O
other O
ways O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
say O
a O
word O
. O
I O
had O
just O
picked O
up O
the O
notion O
that O
equality O
is O
good O
from O
some O
book O
-- O
probably O
from O
poetry O
, O
or O
you O
. O
Anyhow O
, O
it O
's O
been O
knocked O
into O
pieces O
, O
and O
, O
like O
all O
people O
who O
are O
really O
strong O
, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
did O
it O
without O
hurting O
me O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
laugh O
at O
them O
for O
catching O
hay O
fever O
. O
We O
live O
like O
fighting-cocks O
, O
and O
Charles O
takes O

it O
over O

" O
She O
waved O
her O
hand O

laughed O
a O
little O

" O
In O
that O

We O
met O
the O
Wilcoxes O
on O
an O
awful O
expedition O
that O
we O
made O
from O
Heidelberg O
to O
Speyer O
. O
Helen O
and O
I O
had O
got O
it O
into O
our O
heads O
that O
there O
was O
a O
grand O
old O
cathedral O
at O
Speyer O
-- O
the O
Archbishop O
of O
Speyer O
was O
one O
of O
the O
seven O
electors O
-- O
you O
know O
-- O
' O
Speyer O
, O
Maintz O
, O
and O
Koln O
. O
' O
Those O
three O
sees O
once O
commanded O
the O
Rhine O
Valley O
and O
got O
it O
the O
name O
of O
Priest O
Street O
. O
" O
" O
I O
still O
feel O
quite O
uneasy O
about O
this O
business O
, O
Margaret O
. O
" O
" O
The O
train O
crossed O
by O
a O
bridge O
of O
boats O
, O
and O
at O
first O
sight O
it O
looked O
quite O
fine O
. O
But O
oh O
, O
in O
five O
minutes O
we O
had O
seen O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
The O
cathedral O
had O
been O
ruined O
, O
absolutely O
ruined O
, O
by O
restoration O
; O
not O
an O
inch O
left O
of O
the O
original O
structure O
. O
We O
wasted O
a O
whole O
day O
, O
and O
came O
across O
the O
Wilcoxes O
as O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
sandwiches O
in O
the O
public O
gardens O
. O
They O
too O
, O
poor O
things O
, O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
-- O
they O
were O
actually O
stopping O
at O
Speyer O
-- O
and O
they O
rather O
liked O
Helen O
insisting O
that O
they O
must O
fly O
with O
us O
to O
Heidelberg O
. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
they O
did O
come O
on O
next O
day O
. O
We O
all O
took O
some O
drives O
together O
. O
They O
knew O
us O
well O
enough O
to O
ask O
Helen O
to O
come O
and O
see O
them O
-- O
at O
least O
, O
I O
was O
asked O
too O
, O
but O
Tibby O
's O
illness O
prevented O
me O
, O
so O
last O
Monday O
she O
went O
alone O
. O
That O
's O
all O
. O
You O
know O
as O
much O
as O
I O
do O
now O
. O
It O
's O
a O
young O
man O
out O
the O
unknown O
. O
She O
was O
to O
have O
come O
back O
Saturday O
, O
but O
put O
off O
till O
Monday O
, O
perhaps O
on O
account O
of O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
She O
broke O
off O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
sounds O
of O
a O
London O
morning O
. O
Their O
house O
was O
in O
Wickham O
Place O
, O
and O
fairly O
quiet O
, O
for O
a O
lofty O
promontory O
of O
buildings O
separated O
it O
from O
the O
main O
thoroughfare O
. O
One O
had O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
backwater O
, O
or O
rather O
of O
an O
estuary O
, O
whose O
waters O
flowed O
in O
from O
the O
invisible O
sea O
, O
and O
ebbed O
into O
a O
profound O
silence O
while O
the O
waves O
without O
were O
still O
beating O
. O
Though O
the O
promontory O
consisted O
of O
flats O
-- O
expensive O
, O
with O
cavernous O
entrance O
halls O
, O
full O
of O
concierges O

palms O

it O
fulfilled O
its O
purpose O
, O
and O
gained O
for O
the O
older O
houses O
opposite O
a O
certain O
measure O
of O
peace O
. O
These O
, O
too O
, O
would O
be O
swept O
away O
in O
time O
, O
and O
another O
promontory O
would O
rise O
upon O
their O
site O

as O
humanity O
piled O
itself O
higher O
and O
higher O
on O
the O
precious O
soil O

From O

the O

along O

To O
the O
south O

the O
view O
was O
bounded O
by O
the O
majestic O
Pyrenees O

whose O
summits O
, O
veiled O
in O

exhibiting O
awful O

seen O

lost O

as O
the O

along O

sometimes O
barren O

gleamed O
through O
the O
blue O

sometimes O
frowned O
with O
forests O
of O
gloomy O
pine O
, O
that O
swept O
downward O
to O
their O
base O

These O
tremendous O
precipices O
were O
contrasted O
by O
the O
soft O
green O
of O
the O

hung O
upon O

the O
gay O
and O
in O
the O
busy O
scenes O
of O
the O
world O
; O
but O
the O
flattering O
portrait O
of O
mankind O
, O
which O
his O
heart O
had O
delineated O
in O
early O
youth O
, O
his O
experience O
had O
too O
sorrowfully O
corrected O
. O
Yet O
, O
amidst O
the O
changing O
visions O
of O
life O
, O
his O
principles O
remained O
unshaken O
, O
his O
benevolence O
unchilled O
; O
and O
he O
retired O
from O
the O
multitude O
' O
more O
in O
PITY O
than O
in O
anger O
, O
' O
to O
scenes O
of O
simple O
nature O
, O
to O
the O
pure O
delights O
of O
literature O
, O
and O
to O
the O
exercise O
of O
domestic O
virtues O
. O
He O
was O
a O
descendant O
from O
the O
younger O
branch O
of O
an O
illustrious O
family O
, O
and O
it O
was O
designed O
, O
that O
the O
deficiency O
of O
his O
patrimonial O
wealth O
should O
be O
supplied O
either O
by O
a O
splendid O
alliance O
in O
marriage O
, O
or O
by O
success O
in O
the O
intrigues O
of O
public O
affairs O
. O
But O
St. O
Aubert O
had O
too O
nice O
a O
sense O
of O
honour O
to O
fulfil O
the O
latter O
hope O
, O
and O
too O
small O
a O
portion O
of O
ambition O
to O
sacrifice O
what O
he O
called O
happiness O
, O
to O
the O
attainment O
of O
wealth O
. O
After O
the O
death O
of O
his O
father O
he O
married O
a O
very O
amiable O
woman O
, O
his O
equal O
in O
birth O
, O
and O
not O
his O
superior O
in O
fortune O
. O
The O
late O
Monsieur O
St. O
Aubert O
's O
liberality O
, O
or O
extravagance O
, O
had O
so O
much O
involved O
his O
affairs O
, O
that O
his O
son O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
dispose O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
family O
domain O
, O
and O
, O
some O
years O
after O
his O
marriage O
, O
he O
sold O
it O
to O
Monsieur O
Quesnel O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
retired O
to O
a O
small O
estate O
in O
Gascony O
, O
where O
conjugal O
felicity O
, O
and O
parental O
duties O
, O
divided O
his O
attention O
with O
the O
treasures O
of O
knowledge O
and O
the O
illuminations O
of O
genius O
. O
To O
this O
spot O
he O
had O
been O
attached O
from O
his O
infancy O
. O
He O
had O
often O
made O
excursions O
to O
it O
when O
a O
boy O
, O
and O
the O
impressions O
of O
delight O
given O
to O
his O
mind O
by O
the O
homely O
kindness O
of O
the O
grey-headed O
peasant O
, O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
intrusted O
, O
and O
whose O
fruit O
and O
cream O
never O
failed O
, O
had O
not O
been O
obliterated O
by O
succeeding O
circumstances O
. O
The O
green O
pastures O
along O
which O
he O
had O
so O
often O
bounded O
in O
the O
exultation O
of O
health O
, O
and O
youthful O
freedom O
-- O
the O
woods O
, O
under O
whose O
refreshing O
shade O
he O
had O
first O
indulged O
that O
pensive O
melancholy O
, O
which O
afterwards O
made O
a O
strong O
feature O
of O
his O
character O
-- O
the O
wild O
walks O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
the O
river O
, O
on O
whose O
waves O
he O
had O
floated O
, O
and O
the O
distant O
plains O
, O
which O
seemed O
boundless O
as O
his O
early O
hopes O
-- O
were O
never O
after O
remembered O
by O
St. O
Aubert O
but O
with O
enthusiasm O
and O
regret O
. O
At O
length O
he O
disengaged O
himself O
from O
the O
world O
, O
and O
retired O
hither O
, O
to O
realize O
the O
wishes O
of O
many O
years O
. O
The O
building O
, O
as O
it O
then O
stood O
, O
was O
merely O
a O
summer O
cottage O
, O
rendered O
interesting O
to O
a O
stranger O
by O
its O
neat O
simplicity O
, O
or O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
surrounding O
scene O
; O
and O
considerable O
additions O
were O
necessary O
to O
make O
it O
a O
comfortable O
family O
residence O
. O
St. O
Aubert O
felt O
a O
kind O
of O
affection O
for O
every O
part O
of O
the O
fabric O
, O
which O
he O
remembered O
in O
his O
youth O
, O
and O
would O
not O
suffer O
a O
stone O
of O
it O
to O
be O
removed O
, O
so O
that O
the O
new O
building O
, O
adapted O
to O
the O
style O
of O
the O
old O
one O
, O
formed O
with O
it O
only O
a O
simple O
and O
elegant O
residence O
. O
The O
taste O
of O
Madame O
St. O
Aubert O
was O
conspicuous O
in O
its O
internal O
finishing O
, O
where O
the O
same O
chaste O
simplicity O
was O
observable O
in O
the O
furniture O
, O
and O
in O
the O
few O
ornaments O
of O
the O
apartments O
, O
that O
characterized O
the O
manners O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
. O
The O
library O
occupied O
the O
west O
side O
of O
the O
chateau O
, O
and O
was O
enriched O
by O
a O
collection O
of O
the O
best O
books O
in O
the O
ancient O
and O
modern O
languages O
. O
This O
room O
opened O
upon O
a O
grove O
, O
which O
stood O
on O
the O
brow O
of O
a O
gentle O
declivity O
, O
that O
fell O
towards O
the O
river O
, O
and O
the O
tall O
trees O
gave O
it O
a O
melancholy O
and O
pleasing O
shade O
; O
while O
from O
the O
windows O
the O
eye O
caught O
, O
beneath O
the O
spreading O
branches O
, O
the O
gay O
and O
luxuriant O
landscape O
stretching O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
overlooked O
on O
the O
left O
by O
the O
bold O
precipices O
of O
the O
Pyrenees O
. O
Adjoining O
the O
library O
was O
a O
green-house O
, O
stored O
with O
scarce O
and O
beautiful O
plants O
; O
for O
one O
of O
the O
amusements O
of O
St. O
Aubert O
was O
the O
study O
of O
botany O
, O
and O
among O
the O
neighbouring O
mountains O
, O
which O
afforded O
a O
luxurious O
feast O
to O
the O
mind O
of O
the O
naturalist O
, O
he O
often O
passed O
the O
day O
in O
the O
pursuit O
of O
his O
favourite O
science O
. O
He O
was O
sometimes O
accompanied O
in O
these O
little O
excursions O
by O
Madame O
St. O
Aubert O
, O
and O
frequently O
by O
his O
daughter O
; O
when O
, O
with O
a O
small O
osier O
basket O
to O
receive O
plants O
, O
and O
another O
filled O
with O
cold O
refreshments O
, O
such O
as O
the O
cabin O
of O
the O
shepherd O
did O
not O
afford O
, O
they O
wandered O
away O
among O
the O
most O
romantic O
and O
magnificent O
scenes O
, O
nor O
suffered O
the O
charms O
of O
Nature O
's O
lowly O
children O
to O
abstract O
them O
from O
the O
observance O
of O
her O
stupendous O
works O
. O
When O
weary O
of O
sauntering O
among O
cliffs O
that O
seemed O
scarcely O
accessible O
but O
to O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
enthusiast O
, O
and O
where O
no O
track O
appeared O
on O
the O
vegetation O
, O
but O
what O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
izard O
had O
left O
; O
they O
would O
seek O
one O
of O
those O
green O
recesses O
, O
which O
so O
beautifully O
adorn O
the O
bosom O
of O
these O
mountains O
, O
where O
, O
under O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
lofty O
larch O
, O
or O
cedar O
, O
they O
enjoyed O
their O
simple O
repast O
, O
made O
sweeter O
by O
the O
waters O
of O
the O
cool O
stream O
, O
that O
crept O
along O
the O
turf O
, O
and O
by O
the O
breath O
of O
wild O
flowers O
and O
aromatic O
plants O
, O
that O
fringed O
the O
rocks O
, O
and O
inlaid O
the O
grass O
. O
Adjoining O
the O
eastern O
side O
of O
the O
green-house O
, O
looking O
towards O
the O
plains O
of O
Languedoc O
, O
was O
a O
room O
, O
which O
Emily O
called O
hers O
, O
and O
which O
contained O
her O
books O
, O
her O
drawings O
, O
her O
musical O
instruments O
, O
with O
some O
favourite O
birds O
and O
plants O
. O
Here O
she O
usually O
exercised O
herself O
in O
elegant O
arts O
, O
cultivated O
only O
because O
they O
were O
congenial O
to O
her O
taste O
, O
and O
in O
which O
native O
genius O
, O
assisted O
by O
the O
instructions O
of O
Monsieur O
and O
Madame O
St. O
Aubert O
, O
made O
her O
an O
early O
proficient O
. O
The O
windows O
of O
this O
room O
were O
particularly O
pleasant O
; O
they O
descended O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
, O
opening O
upon O
the O
little O
lawn O
that O
surrounded O
the O
house O
, O
the O
eye O
was O
led O
between O
groves O
of O
almond O
, O
palm-trees O
, O
flowering-ash O
, O
and O
myrtle O
, O
to O
the O
distant O
landscape O
, O
where O
the O
Garonne O
wandered O
. O
The O
peasants O
of O
this O
gay O
climate O
were O
often O
seen O
on O
an O
evening O
, O
when O
the O
day O
's O
labour O
was O
done O
, O
dancing O
in O
groups O
on O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
river O
. O
Their O
sprightly O
melodies O
, O
debonnaire O
steps O
, O
the O
fanciful O
figure O
of O
their O
dances O
, O
with O
the O
tasteful O
and O
capricious O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
girls O
adjusted O
their O
simple O
dress O
, O
gave O
a O
character O
to O
the O
scene O
entirely O
French O
. O
The O
front O
of O
the O
chateau O
, O
which O
, O
having O
a O
southern O
aspect O
, O
opened O
upon O
the O
grandeur O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
was O
occupied O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
by O
a O
rustic O
hall O
, O
and O
two O
excellent O
sitting O
rooms O
. O
The O
first O
floor O
, O
for O
the O
cottage O
had O
no O
second O
story O
, O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
bed-chambers O
, O
except O
one O
apartment O
that O
opened O
to O
a O
balcony O
, O
and O
which O
was O
generally O
used O
for O
a O
breakfast-room O
. O
In O
the O
surrounding O
ground O
, O
St. O
Aubert O
had O
made O
very O
tasteful O
improvements O
; O
yet O
, O
such O
was O
his O
attachment O
to O
objects O
he O
had O
remembered O
from O
his O
boyish O
days O
, O
that O
he O
had O
in O
some O
instances O
sacrificed O
taste O
to O
sentiment O
. O
There O
were O
two O
old O
larches O
that O
shaded O
the O
building O
, O
and O
interrupted O
the O
prospect O
; O
St. O
Aubert O
had O
sometimes O
declared O
that O
he O
believed O
he O
should O
have O
been O
weak O
enough O
to O
have O
wept O
at O
their O
fall O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
these O
larches O
he O
planted O
a O
little O
grove O
of O
beech O
, O
pine O
, O
and O
mountain-ash O
. O
On O
a O
lofty O
terrace O
, O
formed O
by O
the O
swelling O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
, O
rose O
a O
plantation O
of O
orange O
, O
lemon O
, O
and O
palm-trees O
, O
whose O
fruit O
, O
in O
the O
coolness O
of O
evening O
, O
breathed O
delicious O
fragrance O
. O
With O
these O
were O
mingled O
a O
few O
trees O
of O
other O
species O
. O
Here O
, O
under O
the O
ample O
shade O
of O
a O
plane-tree O
, O
that O
spread O
its O
majestic O
canopy O
towards O
the O
river O
, O
St. O
Aubert O
loved O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
fine O
evenings O
of O
summer O
, O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
, O
watching O
, O
beneath O
its O
foliage O
, O
the O
setting O
sun O
, O
the O
mild O
splendour O
of O
its O
light O
fading O
from O
the O
distant O
landscape O
, O
till O
the O
shadows O
of O
twilight O
melted O
its O
various O
features O
into O
one O
tint O
of O
sober O
grey O
. O
Here O
, O
too O
, O
he O
loved O
to O
read O
, O
and O
to O
converse O
with O
Madame O
St. O
Aubert O
; O
or O
to O
play O
with O
his O
children O
, O
resigning O
himself O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
those O
sweet O
affections O
, O
which O
are O
ever O
attendant O
on O
simplicity O
and O
nature O
. O
He O
has O
often O
said O
, O
while O
tears O
of O
pleasure O
trembled O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
that O
these O
were O
moments O
infinitely O
more O
delightful O
than O
any O
passed O
amid O
the O
brilliant O
and O
tumultuous O
scenes O
that O
are O
courted O
by O
the O
world O
. O
His O
heart O
was O
occupied O
; O
it O
had O
, O
what O
can O
be O
so O
rarely O
said O
, O
no O
wish O
for O
a O
happiness O
beyond O
what O
it O
experienced O
. O
The O
consciousness O
of O
acting O
right O
diffused O
a O
serenity O
over O
his O
manners O
, O
which O
nothing O
else O
could O
impart O
to O
a O
man O
of O
moral O
perceptions O
like O
his O
, O
and O
which O
refined O
his O
sense O
of O
every O
surrounding O
blessing O
. O
The O
deepest O
shade O
of O
twilight O
did O
not O
send O
him O
from O
his O
favourite O
plane-tree O
. O
He O
loved O
the O
soothing O
hour O
, O
when O
the O
last O
tints O
of O
light O
die O
away O
; O
when O
the O
stars O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
tremble O
through O
aether O
, O
and O
are O
reflected O
on O
the O
dark O
mirror O
of O
the O
waters O
; O
that O
hour O
, O
which O
, O
of O
all O
others O
, O
inspires O
the O
mind O
with O
pensive O
tenderness O
, O
and O
often O
elevates O
it O
to O
sublime O
contemplation O
. O
When O
the O
moon O
shed O
her O
soft O
rays O
among O
the O
foliage O
, O
he O
still O
lingered O
, O
and O
his O
pastoral O
supper O
of O
cream O
and O
fruits O
was O
often O
spread O
beneath O
it O
. O
Then O
, O
on O
the O
stillness O
of O
night O
, O
came O
the O
song O
of O
the O
nightingale O
, O
breathing O
sweetness O
, O
and O
awakening O
melancholy O
. O

CHAPTER O

A O
Not O
Unnatural O
Enterprise O
This O
is O
written O
from O
memory O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
If O
I PRON_PER
could O
have O
brought O
with O
me PRON_PER
the O
material O
I PRON_PER
so O
carefully O
prepared O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
very O
different O
story O
. O
Whole O
books O
full O
of O
notes O
, O
carefully O
copied O
records O
, O
firsthand O
descriptions O
, O
and O
the O
pictures O
-- O
that O
’s O
the O
worst O
loss O
. PRON_PER
We PRON_PER
had O
some O
bird O
’s O
- O
eyes O
of O
the O
cities O
and O
parks O
; O
a O
lot O
of O
lovely O
views O
of O
streets O
, O
of O
buildings O
, O
outside O
and O
in O
, O
and O
some O
of O
those O
gorgeous O
gardens O
, O
and O
, O
most O
important O
of O
all O
, O
of O
the O
women O
themselves O
. O
Nobody O
will O
ever O
believe O
how O
they O
looked O
. O
Descriptions O
are O
n’t O
any O
good O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
women O
, O
and O
I O
never O
was O
good O
at O
descriptions O
anyhow O
. O
But O
it O
’s O
got O
to O
be O
done O
somehow O
; O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
needs O
to O
know O
about O
that O
country O
. O
I O
have O
n’t O
said O
where O
it O
was O
for O
fear O
some O
self-appointed O
missionaries O
, O
or O
traders O
, O
or O
land-greedy O
expansionists O
, O
will O
take O
it O
upon O
themselves O
to O
push O
in O
. O
They O
will O
not O
be O
wanted O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
them O
that O
, O
and O
will O
fare O
worse O
than O
we O
did O
if O
they O
do O
find O
it O
. O
It O
began O
this O
way O
. O
There O
were O
three O
of O
us O
, O
classmates O
and O
friends O
-- O
Terry O
O. O
Nicholson O
( O
we O
used O
to O
call O
him O
the O
Old O
Nick O
, O
with O
good O
reason O
) O
, O
Jeff O
Margrave O
, O
and O
I O
, O
Vandyck O
Jennings O
. O
We O
had O
known O
each O
other O
years O
and O
years O
, O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
differences O
we O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
in O
common O
. O
All O
of O
us O
were O
interested O
in O
science O
. O
Terry O
was O
rich O
enough O
to O
do O
as O
he O
pleased O
. O
His O
great O
aim O
was O
exploration O
. O
He O
used O
to O
make O
all O
kinds O

because O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
to O
explore O
now O
, O
only O
patchwork O
and O
filling O
in O
, O
he O
said O
. O
He O
filled O
in O
well O
enough O
-- O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
talents O
-- O
great O
on O
mechanics O
and O
electricity O
. O
Had O
all O
kinds O
of O
boats O
and O
motorcars O
, O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
of O
our O
airmen O
. O
We O
never O
could O
have O
done O
the O
thing O
at O
all O
without O
Terry O

Jeff O
Margrave O
was O
born O
to O
be O
a O
poet O
, O
a O
botanist O
-- O
or O
both O
-- O
but O
his O
folks O
persuaded O
him O
to O
be O
a O
doctor O
instead O
. O
He O
was O
a O
good O
one O
, O
for O
his O
age O
, O
but O
his O
real O
interest O
was O
in O
what O
he O
loved O
to O
call O
" O
the O
wonders O
of O
science O
. O
" O
As O
for O
me O
, O
sociology O
’s O
my O
major O
. O
You O
have O
to O
back O
that O
up O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
sciences O
, O
of O
course O
. O
I O
’m O
interested O
in O
them O
all O
. O
Terry O
was O
strong O
on O
facts O
-- O
geography O
and O
meteorology O
and O
those O
; O
Jeff O
could O
beat O
him O
any O
time O
on O
biology O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n’t O
care O
what O
it O
was O
they O
talked O
about O
, O
so O
long O
as O
it O
connected O
with O
human O
life O
, O
somehow O
. O
There O
are O
few O
things O
that O
do O
n’t O
. O
We O
three O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
join O
a O
big O
scientific O
expedition O
. O
They O
needed O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
that O
gave O
Jeff O
an O
excuse O
for O
dropping O
his O
just O
opening O
practice O
; O
they O
needed O
Terry O
’s O
experience O
, O
his O
machine O
, O
and O
his O
money O
; O
and O
as O
for O
me O
, O
I O
got O
in O
through O
Terry O
’s O
influence O
. O
The O
expedition O
was O
up O
among O
the O
thousand O
tributaries O
and O
enormous O
hinterland O
of O
a O
great O
river O
, O
up O
where O
the O
maps O
had O
to O
be O
made O
, O
savage O
dialects O
studied O
, O
and O
all O
manner O
of O
strange O
flora O
and O
fauna O
expected O
. O
But O
this O
story O
is O
not O
about O
that O
expedition O
. O
That O
was O
only O
the O
merest O
starter O
for O
ours O
. O
My O
interest O
was O
first O
roused O
by O
talk O
among O
our O
guides O
. O
I O
’m O
quick O
at O
languages O
, O
know O
a O
good O
many O
, O
and O
pick O
them O
up O
readily O
. O
What O
with O
that O
and O
a O
really O
good O
interpreter O
we O
took O
with O
us O
, O
I O
made O
out O
quite O
a O
few O
legends O
and O
folk O
myths O
of O
these O
scattered O
tribes O
. O
And O
as O
we O
got O
farther O
and O
farther O
upstream O
, O
in O
a O
dark O
tangle O
of O
rivers O
, O
lakes O
, O
morasses O
, O
and O
dense O
forests O
, O
with O
here O
and O
there O
an O
unexpected O
long O
spur O
running O
out O
from O
the O
big O
mountains O
beyond O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
more O
and O
more O
of O
these O
savages O
had O
a O
story O
about O
a O
strange O
and O
terrible O
Woman O
Land O
in O
the O
high O
distance O
. O
" O
Up O
yonder O
, O
" O
" O
Over O
there O
, O
" O
" O
Way O
up O
" O
-- O
was O
all O
the O
direction O
they O
could O
offer O
, O
but O
their O
legends O
all O
agreed O
on O
the O
main O
point O
-- O
that O
there O
was O
this O
strange O
country O
where O
no O
men O
lived O
-- O
only O
women O
and O
girl O
children O
. O
None O
of O
them O
had O
ever O
seen O
it O
. O
It O
was O
dangerous O
, O
deadly O
, O
they O
said O
, O
for O
any O
man O
to O
go O
there O
. O
But O
there O
were O
tales O
of O
long O
ago O
, O
when O
some O
brave O
investigator O
had O
seen O
it O
-- O
a O
Big O
Country O
, O
Big O
Houses O
, O
Plenty O
People O
-- O
All O
Women O
. O
Had O
no O
one O
else O
gone O
? O
Yes O
-- O
a O
good O
many O
-- O
but O
they O
never O
came O
back O
. O
It O
was O
no O
place O
for O
men O
-- O
of O
that O
they O
seemed O
sure O
. O
I O
told O
the O
boys O
about O
these O
stories O
, O
and O
they O
laughed O
at O
them O
. O
Naturally O
I O
did O
myself O
. O
I O
knew O
the O
stuff O
that O
savage O
dreams O
are O
made O
of O
. O
But O
when O
we O
had O
reached O
our O
farthest O
point O
, O
just O
the O
day O
before O
we O
all O
had O
to O
turn O
around O
and O
start O
for O
home O
again O
, O
as O
the O
best O
of O
expeditions O
must O
in O
time O
, O
we O
three O
made O
a O
discovery O
. O
The O
main O
encampment O
was O
on O
a O
spit O
of O
land O
running O
out O
into O
the O
main O
stream O
, O
or O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
the O
main O
stream O
. O
It O
had O
the O
same O
muddy O
color O
we O
had O
been O
seeing O
for O
weeks O
past O
, O
the O
same O
taste O
. O
I O
happened O
to O
speak O
of O
that O
river O
to O
our O
last O
guide O
, O
a O
rather O
superior O
fellow O
with O
quick O
, O
bright O
eyes O
. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
there O
was O
another O
river O
-- O
" O
over O
there O
, O
short O
river O
, O
sweet O
water O
, O
red O
and O
blue O
. O
" O
I O
was O
interested O
in O
this O
and O
anxious O
to O
see O
if O
I O
had O
understood O
, O
so O
I O
showed O
him O
a O
red O
and O
blue O
pencil O
I O
carried O
, O
and O
asked O
again O
. O
Yes O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
river O
, O
and O
then O
to O
the O
southwestward O
. O
" O
River O
-- O
good O
water O
-- O
red O
and O
blue O
. O
" O
Terry O
was O
close O
by O
and O
interested O
in O
the O
fellow O
’s O
pointing O
. O
" O
What O
does O
he O
say O
, O
Van O
? O
" O
I O
told O
him O
. O
Terry O
blazed O
up O
at O
once O
. O
" O
Ask O
him O
how O
far O
it O
is O
. O
" O
The O
man O
indicated O
a O
short O
journey O
; O
I O
judged O
about O
two O
hours O
, O
maybe O
three O
. O
" O
Let O
’s O
go O
, O
" O
urged O
Terry O
. O
" O
Just O
us O
three O
. O
Maybe O
we O
can O
really O
find O
something O
. O
May O
be O
cinnabar O
in O
it O
. O
" O
" O
May O
be O
indigo O
, O
" O
Jeff O
suggested O
, O
with O
his O
lazy O
smile O
. O
It O
was O
early O
yet O
; O
we O
had O
just O
breakfasted O
; O
and O
leaving O
word O
that O
we O
’d O
be O
back O
before O
night O
, O
we O
got O
away O
quietly O
, O
not O
wishing O
to O
be O
thought O
too O
gullible O
if O
we O
failed O
, O
and O
secretly O
hoping O
to O
have O
some O
nice O
little O
discovery O
all O
to O
ourselves O
. O
It O
was O
a O
long O
two O
hours O
, O
nearer O
three O
. O
I O
fancy O
the O
savage O
could O
have O
done O
it O
alone O
much O
quicker O
. O
There O
was O
a O
desperate O
tangle O
of O
wood O
and O
water O
and O
a O
swampy O
patch O
we O
never O
should O
have O
found O
our O
way O
across O
alone O
. O
But O
there O
was O
one O
, O
and O
I O
could O
see O
Terry O
, O
with O
compass O
and O
notebook O
, O
marking O
directions O
and O
trying O
to O
place O
landmarks O
. O
We O
came O
after O
a O
while O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
marshy O
lake O
, O
very O
big O
, O
so O
that O
the O
circling O
forest O
looked O
quite O
low O
and O
dim O
across O
it O
. O
Our O
guide O
told O
us O
that O
boats O
could O
go O
from O
there O
to O
our O
camp O
-- O
but O
" O
long O
way O
-- O
all O
day O
. O
" O
This O
water O
was O
somewhat O
clearer O
than O
that O
we O
had O
left O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
judge O
well O
from O
the O
margin O
. O
We O
skirted O
it O
for O
another O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
, O
the O
ground O
growing O
firmer O
as O
we O
advanced O
, O
and O
presently O
we O
turned O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
wooded O
promontory O
and O
saw O
a O
quite O
different O
country O
-- O
a O
sudden O
view O
of O
mountains O
, O
steep O
and O
bare O
. O
" O
One O
of O
those O
long O
easterly O
spurs O
, O
" O
Terry O
said O
appraisingly O
. O
" O
May O
be O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
from O
the O
range O
. O
They O
crop O
out O
like O
that O
. O
" O
Suddenly O
we O
left O
the O
lake O
and O
struck O
directly O
toward O
the O
cliffs O
. O
We O
heard O
running O
water O
before O
we O
reached O
it O
, O
and O
the O
guide O
pointed O
proudly O
to O
his O
river O
. O
It O
was O
short O
. O
We O
could O
see O
where O
it O
poured O
down O
a O
narrow O
vertical O
cataract O
from O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
cliff O
. O
It O
was O
sweet O
water O
. O
The O
guide O
drank O
eagerly O
and O
so O
did O
we O
. O
" O
That O
’s O
snow O
water O
, O
" O
Terry O
announced O
. O
" O
Must O
come O
from O
way O
back O
in O
the O
hills O
. O
" O
But O
as O
to O
being O
red O
and O
blue O
-- O
it O
was O
greenish O
in O
tint O
. O
The O
guide O
seemed O
not O
at O
all O
surprised O
. O
He O
hunted O
about O
a O
little O
and O
showed O
us O
a O
quiet O
marginal O
pool O
where O
there O
were O
smears O
of O
red O
along O
the O
border O
; O
yes O
, O
and O
of O
blue O
. O
Terry O
got O
out O
his O
magnifying O
glass O
and O
squatted O
down O
to O
investigate O
. O
" O
Chemicals O
of O
some O
sort O
-- O
I O
ca O
n’t O
tell O
on O
the O
spot O
. O
Look O
to O
me O
like O
dyestuffs O
. O
Let O
’s O
get O
nearer O
, O
" O
he O
urged O
, O
" O
up O
there O
by O
the O
fall O
. O
" O
We O
scrambled O
along O
the O
steep O
banks O
and O
got O
close O
to O
the O
pool O
that O
foamed O
and O
boiled O
beneath O
the O
falling O
water O
. O
Here O
we O
searched O
the O
border O
and O
found O
traces O
of O
color O
beyond O
dispute O
. O
More O
-- O
Jeff O
suddenly O
held O
up O
an O
unlooked-for O
trophy O
. O
It O
was O
only O
a O
rag O
, O
a O
long O
, O
raveled O
fragment O
of O
cloth O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
well-woven O
fabric O
, O
with O
a O
pattern O
, O
and O
of O
a O
clear O
scarlet O
that O
the O
water O
had O
not O
faded O
. O
No O
savage O
tribe O
that O
we O
had O
heard O
of O
made O
such O
fabrics O
. O
The O
guide O
stood O
serenely O
on O
the O
bank O
, O
well O
pleased O
with O
our O
excitement O
. O
" O
One O
day O
blue O
-- O
one O
day O
red O
-- O
one O
day O
green O
, O
" O
he O
told O
us O
, O
and O
pulled O
from O
his O
pouch O
another O
strip O
of O
bright-hued O
cloth O
. O
" O
Come O
down O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
cataract O
. O
" O
Woman O
Country O
-- O
up O
there O
. O
" O
Then O
we O
were O
interested O
. O
We O
had O
our O
rest O
and O
lunch O
right O
there O
and O
pumped O
the O
man O
for O
further O
information O
. O
He O
could O
tell O
us O
only O
what O
the O
others O
had O
-- O
a O
land O
of O
women O
-- O
no O
men O
-- O
babies O
, O
but O
all O
girls O
. O
No O
place O
for O
men O
-- O
dangerous O
. O
Some O
had O
gone O
to O
see O
-- O
none O
had O
come O
back O
. O
I O
could O
see O
Terry O
’s O
jaw O
set O
at O
that O
. O
No O
place O
for O
men O
? O
Dangerous O
? O
He O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
might O
shin O
up O
the O
waterfall O
on O
the O
spot O
. O
But O
the O
guide O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
going O
up O
, O
even O
if O
there O
had O
been O
any O
possible O
method O
of O
scaling O
that O
sheer O
cliff O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
get O
back O
to O
our O
party O
before O
night O
. O
" O
They O
might O
stay O
if O
we O
told O
them O
, O
" O
I O
suggested O
. O
But O
Terry O
stopped O
in O
his O
tracks O
. O
" O
Look O
here O
, O
fellows O
, O
" O
he O
said O

" O
This O
is O

not O
tell O
those O

Certain O
it O
is O
that O
, O
some O
fifteen O
or O
twenty O
years O
after O
the O
settlement O
of O
the O
town O
, O
the O
wooden O
jail O
was O
already O
marked O
with O
weather-stains O

other O
indications O
of O
age O

which O
gave O
a O
yet O
darker O
aspect O
to O
its O
beetle-browed O

gloomy O
front O
. O
The O
rust O
on O
the O
ponderous O
iron-work O
of O
its O
oaken O

looked O
more O

anything O

all O
that O

to O

it O
seemed O
never O

Before O
this O
ugly O
edifice O

between O
it O

the O

was O
a O

much O
overgrown O
with O
burdock O

apple-pern O

such O

that O

was O
to O

much O
the O

solemnity O

as O

a O
people O

were O
almost O

both O
were O
so O

that O
the O

was O
the O

from O

would O
infer O
a O
degree O

be O
invested O
with O
almost O
as O
stern O
a O
dignity O

the O
punishment O

itself O

It O
was O
a O
circumstance O
to O
be O
noted O
on O
the O
summer O
morning O
when O
our O
story O

its O
course O
, O
that O
the O
women O

of O

there O
were O
several O
in O

appeared O
to O
take O
a O
peculiar O
interest O
in O
whatever O
penal O
infliction O
might O
be O
expected O
to O
ensue O
. O
The O
age O
had O
not O
so O
much O
refinement O
, O
that O
any O
sense O
of O
impropriety O
restrained O
the O
wearers O
of O
petticoat O

farthingale O
from O
stepping O
forth O
into O
the O
public O
ways O
, O
and O
wedging O
their O
not O
unsubstantial O
persons O
, O
if O
occasion O
were O
, O
into O
the O
throng O
nearest O
to O
the O
scaffold O
at O
an O
execution O
. O
Morally O
, O
as O
well O
as O
materially O
, O
there O
was O
a O
coarser O
fibre O
in O
those O
wives O

of O
old O
English O
birth O

breeding O
than O
in O

a O
series O
of O
six O
or O
seven O

; O
for O
, O
throughout O

chain O
of O
ancestry O

every O
successive O
mother O

transmitted O
to O
her O
child O
a O
fainter O
bloom O
, O
a O
more O
delicate O

briefer O
beauty O

The O
women O
who O
were O
now O
standing O
about O
the O

within O
less O
than O
half O
a O
century O
of O
the O
period O
when O
the O
man-like O
Elizabeth O

been O
the O
not O
altogether O
unsuitable O
representative O
of O

sex O

were O
her O

with O
a O
moral O

The O
bright O
morning O

shone O
on O
broad O
shoulders O

well-developed O
busts O

on O
round O

ruddy O
cheeks O

that O

hardly O
yet O
grown O
paler O

thinner O

of O
New O

There O
was O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
boldness O

rotundity O
of O
speech O
among O
these O
matrons O
, O
as O
most O
of O

seemed O
to O
be O

that O

startle O
us O

volume O

added O
a O

matron O

they O

Madame O

cried O
another O
female O

the O

the O
most O

these O
self-constituted O

" O
The O
door O
of O
the O
jail O

flung O
open O
from O
within O
there O
appeared O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
like O
a O
black O
shadow O
emerging O
into O
sunshine O
, O
the O
grim O
and O
grisly O
presence O
of O
the O
town-beadle O
, O
with O
a O
sword O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
his O
staff O
of O
office O
in O
his O
hand O
. O
This O
personage O
prefigured O
and O
represented O
in O
his O
aspect O
the O
whole O
dismal O
severity O
of O
the O
Puritanic O
code O
of O
law O
, O
which O
it O
was O
his O
business O
to O
administer O
in O
its O
final O
and O
closest O
application O
to O
the O
offender O
. O
Stretching O
forth O
the O
official O
staff O
in O
his O
left O
hand O
, O
he O
laid O
his O
right O
upon O
the O
shoulder O
of O
a O
young O
woman O
, O
whom O
he O
thus O
drew O
forward O
, O
until O
, O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
prison-door O
, O
she O
repelled O
him O
, O
by O
an O
action O
marked O
with O
natural O
dignity O
and O
force O
of O
character O
, O
and O
stepped O
into O
the O
open O
air O
as O
if O
by O
her O
own O
free O
will O
. O
She O
bore O
in O
her O
arms O
a O
child O
, O
a O
baby O
of O
some O
three O
months O
old O
, O
who O
winked O
and O
turned O
aside O
its O
little O
face O
from O
the O
too O
vivid O
light O
of O
day O
; O
because O
its O
existence O
, O
heretofore O
, O
had O
brought O
it O
acquaintance O
only O
with O
the O
grey O
twilight O
of O
a O
dungeon O
, O
or O
other O
darksome O
apartment O
of O
the O
prison O
. O
When O
the O
young O
woman O
-- O
the O
mother O
of O
this O
child O
-- O
stood O
fully O
revealed O
before O
the O
crowd O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
her O
first O
impulse O
to O
clasp O
the O
infant O
closely O
to O
her O
bosom O
; O
not O
so O
much O
by O
an O
impulse O
of O
motherly O
affection O
, O
as O
that O
she O
might O
thereby O
conceal O
a O
certain O
token O
, O
which O
was O
wrought O
or O
fastened O
into O
her O
dress O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
wisely O
judging O
that O
one O
token O
of O
her O
shame O
would O
but O
poorly O
serve O
to O
hide O
another O
, O
she O
took O
the O
baby O
on O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
with O
a O
burning O
blush O
, O
and O
yet O
a O
haughty O
smile O
, O
and O
a O
glance O
that O
would O
not O
be O
abashed O
, O
looked O
around O
at O
her O
townspeople O
and O
neighbours O
. O
On O
the O
breast O
of O
her O
gown O
, O
in O
fine O
red O
cloth O
, O
surrounded O
with O
an O
elaborate O
embroidery O

fantastic O
flourishes O
of O
gold O
thread O
, O
appeared O
the O
letter O
A O

It O
was O
so O
artistically O
done O
, O
and O
with O
so O
much O
fertility O
and O
gorgeous O
luxuriance O
of O
fancy O
, O
that O
it O
had O
all O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
last O
and O
fitting O
decoration O
to O
the O
apparel O
which O
she O
wore O
, O
and O
which O
was O
of O
a O
splendour O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
age O
, O
but O
greatly O
beyond O
what O
was O
allowed O
by O
the O
sumptuary O

halted O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
timbered O
ridge O
, O
to O
listen O
and O
to O
watch O
. O
Beneath O
him PRON_PER
lay O
a O
narrow O
valley O
, O
open O
and O
grassy O
, O
from O
which O
rose O
a O
faint O
murmur O
of O
running O
water O
. O
Its O
music O
was O
pierced O
by O
the O
wild O
staccato O
yelp O
of O
a O
hunting O
coyote O
. O
From O
overhead O
in O
the O
giant O
fir O
came O
a O
twittering O
and O
rustling O
of O
grouse O
settling O
for O
the O
night O
; O
and O
from O
across O
the O
valley O
drifted O
the O
last O
low O
calls O
of O
wild O
turkeys O
going O
to O
roost O
. O
To O
Dale PROP_PER
's O
keen O
ear O
these O
sounds O
were O
all O
they O
should O
have O
been O
, O
betokening O
an O
unchanged O
serenity O
of O
forestland O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
glad O
, O
for O
he PRON_PER
had O
expected O
to O
hear O
the O
clipclop O
of O
white NOM_PER
men NOM_PER

horses O
-- O
which O
to O
hear O
up O
in O
those O

was O
hateful O
to O
him PRON_PER
. O
He PRON_PER
and O
the NOM_PER

friends NOM_PER
. O
That NOM_PER
fierce NOM_PER
foe NOM_PER
had O
no O

the NOM_PER
lone NOM_PER

. O
But O
there O
hid O
somewhere O
in O
the O
forest O
a NOM_PER
gang NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
bad NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
sheep-thieves NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
whom NOM_PER

. O
As O
he O
started O
out O
upon O
the O
slope O
, O
a O
sudden O
flaring O
of O
the O
afterglow O
of O
sunset O
flooded O
down O
from O
Old O
Baldy O
, O
filling O
the O
valley O
with O
lights O
and O
shadows O
, O
yellow O
and O
blue O
, O
like O
the O
radiance O
of O
the O
sky O
. O
The O
pools O
in O
the O
curves O
of O
the O
brook O
shone O
darkly O
bright O
. O
Dale O
's O
gaze O
swept O
up O
and O
down O
the O
valley O
, O
and O
then O
tried O
to O
pierce O
the O
black O
shadows O
across O
the O
brook O
where O
the O
wall O
of O
spruce O
stood O
up O
, O
its O
speared O
and O
spiked O
crest O
against O
the O
pale O
clouds O
. O
The O
wind O
began O
to O
moan O
in O
the O
trees O
and O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
of O
rain O
in O
the O
air O
. O
Dale O
, O
striking O
a O
trail O
, O
turned O
his O
back O
to O
the O
fading O
afterglow O
and O
strode O
down O
the O
valley O
. O
With O
night O
at O
hand O
and O
a O
rain-storm O
brewing O
, O
he O
did O
not O
head O
for O
his O
own O
camp O
, O
some O
miles O
distant O
, O
but O
directed O
his O
steps O
toward O
an O
old O
log O
cabin O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
it O
darkness O
had O
almost O
set O
in O
. O
He O
approached O
with O
caution O
. O
This O
cabin O
, O
like O
the O
few O
others O
scattered O
in O
the O
valleys O
, O
might O
harbor O
Indians O
or O
a O
bear O
or O
a O
panther O
. O
Nothing O
, O
however O
, O
appeared O
to O
be O
there O
. O
Then O
Dale O
studied O
the O
clouds O
driving O
across O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
the O
cool O
dampness O
of O
a O
fine O
, O
misty O
rain O
on O
his O
face O
. O
It O
would O
rain O
off O
and O
on O
during O
the O
night O
. O
Whereupon O
he O
entered O
the O
cabin O
. O
And O
the O
next O
moment O
he O
heard O
quick O
hoof-beats O
of O
trotting O
horses O
. O
Peering O
out O
, O
he O
saw O
dim O
, O
moving O
forms O
in O
the O
darkness O
, O
quite O
close O
at O
hand O
. O
They O
had O
approached O
against O
the O
wind O
so O
that O
sound O
had O
been O
deadened O
. O
Five O
horses O
with O
riders O
, O
Dale O
made O
out O
-- O
saw O
them O
loom O
close O
. O
Then O
he O
heard O
rough O
voices O
. O
Quickly O
he O
turned O
to O
feel O
in O
the O
dark O
for O
a O
ladder O
he O
knew O
led O
to O
a O
loft O
; O
and O
finding O
it O
, O
he O
quickly O
mounted O
, O
taking O
care O
not O
to O
make O
a O
noise O
with O
his O
rifle O
, O
and O
lay O
down O
upon O
the O
floor O
of O
brush O
and O
poles O
. O
Scarcely O
had O
he O
done O
so O
when O
heavy O
steps O
, O
with O
accompaniment O
of O
clinking O
spurs O
, O
passed O
through O
the O
door O
below O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
Wal O
, O
Beasley O
, O
are O
you O
here O
? O
" O
queried O
a O
loud O
voice O
. O
There O
was O
no O
reply O
. O
The O
man O
below O
growled O
under O
his O
breath O
, O
and O
again O
the O
spurs O
jingled O
. O
" O
Fellars O
, O
Beasley O
ai O

" O
" O

" O

" O
Low O
, O
muttered O
curses O
, O
then O
mingled O
with O
dull O
thuds O
of O
hoofs O
and O
strain O
of O
leather O
and O
heaves O
of O
tired O
horses O
. O
Another O
shuffling O
, O
clinking O
footstep O
entered O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
Snake O
, O
it O
'd O
been O

" O
Dale O
, O
lying O
still O
and O
prone O
, O
felt O
a O
slow O
start O
in O
all O
his O
blood O
-- O
a O
thrilling O
wave O
. O
That O
deep-voiced O
man O
below O
was O
Snake O
Anson O
, O
the O
worst O
and O
most O
dangerous O
character O
of O
the O
region O
; O
and O
the O
others O
, O
undoubtedly O
, O
composed O
his O
gang O
, O
long O
notorious O
in O
that O
sparsely O
settled O
country O
. O
And O
the O
Beasley O
mentioned O
-- O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
two O
biggest O
ranchers O
and O
sheep-raisers O
of O
the O
White O
Mountain O
ranges O
. O
What O
was O
the O
meaning O
of O
a O
rendezvous O
between O
Snake O
Anson O
and O
Beasley O
? O
Milt O
Dale O
answered O
that O
question O
to O
Beasley O
's O
discredit O
; O
and O
many O
strange O
matters O
pertaining O
to O
sheep O
and O
herders O
, O
always O
a O
mystery O
to O
the O
little O
village O
of O
Pine O
, O
now O
became O
as O
clear O
as O
daylight O
. O
Other O
men O
entered O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
It O

" O
said O
one O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
crash O
of O
wood O
thrown O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
Jim O
, O
hyar O

, O
" O
said O
another O
. O
Rustlings O
and O
slow O
footsteps O
, O
and O
then O
heavy O
thuds O
attested O
to O
the O
probability O
that O
Jim O
was O
knocking O
the O
end O
of O
a O
log O
upon O
the O
ground O
to O
split O
off O
a O
corner O
whereby O
a O
handful O
of O

splinters O
could O
be O
procured O

" O

" O
drawled O
Jim O
. O
Sharp O
click O
of O
steel O
on O
flint O
-- O
many O
times O
-- O
and O
then O
a O
sound O
of O
hard O
blowing O
and O
sputtering O
told O
of O
Jim O
's O
efforts O
to O
start O
a O
fire O
. O
Presently O
the O
pitchy O
blackness O
of O
the O
cabin O
changed O
; O
there O
came O
a O
little O
crackling O
of O
wood O
and O
the O
rustle O
of O
flame O
, O
and O
then O
a O
steady O
growing O
roar O
. O
As O
it O
chanced O
, O
Dale O
lay O
face O
down O
upon O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
loft O
, O
and O
right O
near O
his O
eyes O
there O
were O
cracks O
between O
the O
boughs O
. O
When O
the O
fire O
blazed O
up O
he O
was O
fairly O
well O
able O
to O
see O
the O
men O
below O
. O
The O
only O
one O
he O
had O
ever O
seen O
was O
Jim O
Wilson O
, O
who O
had O
been O
well O
known O
at O
Pine O
before O
Snake O
Anson O
had O
ever O
been O
heard O
of O
. O
Jim O
was O
the O
best O
of O
a O
bad O
lot O
, O
and O
he O
had O
friends O
among O
the O
honest O
people O
. O
It O
was O
rumored O
that O
he O
and O
Snake O
did O
not O
pull O
well O
together O
. O
" O
Fire O
feels O
good O
, O
" O
said O
the O
burly O
Moze O
, O
who O
appeared O
as O
broad O
as O
he O
was O
black-visaged O
. O
" O

spoke O
up O
another O
voice O
. O
Moze O
shuffled O
out O
with O
alacrity O
. O
In O
the O
firelight O
Snake O
Anson O
's O
face O
looked O
lean O
and O
serpent-like O
, O
his O
eyes O
glittered O
, O
and O
his O
long O
neck O
and O
all O
of O
his O
long O
length O
carried O
out O
the O
analogy O
of O
his O
name O
. O
" O
Snake O

what O

the O

queried O
the O
youngest O
of O
the O
gang O
, O
a O
boy O
in O
years O
, O
whose O
hard O
, O
bitter O
lips O
and O
hungry O
eyes O
somehow O
set O
him O
apart O
from O
his O
comrades O
. O
" O
You O

Burt O

an O
' O

the O

out O
. O
" O

, O

Snake O
, O
gruffly O

At O
the O
juncture O
Moze O
returned O
. O
" O

I O
heerd O

he O
said O
. O
Snake O
rose O
and O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
, O
listening O
. O
Outside O
the O
wind O
moaned O
fitfully O
and O
scattering O
raindrops O
pattered O
upon O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
A-huh O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Snake O
, O
in O
relief O
. O
Silence O
ensued O
then O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
interval O
Dale O
heard O
a O
rapid O
clip-clop O
on O
the O
rocky O
trail O
outside O
. O
The O
men O
below O
shuffled O
uneasily O
, O
but O
none O
of O
them O
spoke O
. O
The O
fire O
cracked O
cheerily O
. O
Snake O
Anson O
stepped O
back O
from O
before O
the O
door O
with O
an O
action O
that O
expressed O
both O
doubt O
and O
caution O
. O
The O
trotting O
horse O
had O
halted O
out O
there O
somewhere O
. O
" O
Ho O
there O
, O
inside O
! O
" O
called O
a O
voice O
from O
the O

. O
" O
Ho O

" O
replied O
Anson O
. O
" O
That O

" O
quickly O
followed O
the O
query O
. O
" O
Reckon O
so O
, O
" O
returned O
Anson O
, O
showing O
himself O
. O
The O
newcomer O
entered O
. O
He O
was O
a O
large O
man O
, O
wearing O
a O
slicker O
that O
shone O
wet O
in O
the O
firelight O
. O
His O
sombrero O
, O
pulled O
well O
down O
, O
shadowed O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
the O
upper O
half O
of O
his O
features O
might O
as O
well O
have O
been O
masked O
. O
He O
had O
a O
black O
, O
drooping O
mustache O
, O
and O
a O
chin O
like O
a O
rock O
. O
A O
potential O
force O
, O
matured O
and O
powerful O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
wrapped O
in O
his O
movements O
. O
" O
Hullo O

Hullo O

seems O
a O
wonderful O
place O
, O
from O
the O
glimpse O
which O
I PRON_PER
got O
of O
it O
from O
the O
train O
and O
the O
little O
I PRON_PER
could O
walk O
through O
the O
streets O
. O
I PRON_PER
feared O
to O
go O
very O
far O
from O
the O
station O
, O
as O
we PRON_PER
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
would O
start O
as O
near O
the O
correct O
time O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
impression O
I PRON_PER
had O
was O
that O
we PRON_PER
were O
leaving O
the O
West O
and O
entering O
the O
East O
; O
the O
most O
western O
of O
splendid O
bridges O
over O
the O
Danube O
, O
which O
is O
here O
of O
noble O
width O
and O
depth O
, O
took O
us PRON_PER
among O
the O
traditions O
of O
Turkish O
rule O
. O
We PRON_PER
left O
in O
pretty O
good O
time O
, O
and O
came O
after O
nightfall O
to O
Klausenburgh O
. O
Here O
I PRON_PER
stopped O
for O
the O
night O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Royale O
. O
I PRON_PER
had O
for O
dinner O
, O
or O
rather O
supper O
, O
a O
chicken O
done O
up O
some O
way O
with O
red O
pepper O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
but O
thirsty O
. O

I PRON_PER
asked O
the NOM_PER
waiter NOM_PER
, O
and O
he PRON_PER
said O
it O
was O
called O
" O
paprika O
hendl O
, O
" O
and O
that O
, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
national O
dish O
, O
I PRON_PER
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
it O
anywhere O
along O
the O
Carpathians O
. O
I PRON_PER
found O
my PRON_PER
smattering O
of O
German O
very O
useful O
here O
; O
indeed O
, O
I PRON_PER
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I PRON_PER
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
on O
without O
it O
. O
Having O
had O
some O
time O
at O
my PRON_PER
disposal O
when O
in O
London O
, O
I PRON_PER
had O
visited O
the O
British O
Museum O
, O
and O
made O
search O
among O
the O
books O
and O
maps O
in O
the O
library O
regarding O
Transylvania O
; O
it O
had O
struck O
me PRON_PER
that O
some O
foreknowledge O
of O
the O
country O
could O
hardly O
fail O
to O
have O
some O
importance O
in O
dealing O
with O
a NOM_PER
nobleman NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
that NOM_PER
country NOM_PER
. O
I PRON_PER
find O
that O
the O
district O
he PRON_PER
named O
is O
in O
the O
extreme O
east O
of O
the O
country O
, O
just O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
three O
states O
, O
Transylvania O
, O
Moldavia O
and O
Bukovina O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
Carpathian O
mountains O
; O
one O
of O
the O
wildest O
and O
least O
known O
portions O
of O
Europe O
. O
I PRON_PER
was O
not O
able O
to O
light O
on O
any O
map O
or O
work O
giving O
the O
exact O
locality O
of O
the O
Castle O
Dracula O
, O
as O
there O
are O
no O
maps O
of O
this O
country O
as O
yet O
to O
compare O
with O
our PRON_PER
own O
Ordnance O
Survey O
maps O
; O
but O
I PRON_PER
found O
that O
Bistritz O
, O
the O
post O
town O
named O
by O
Count PROP_PER
Dracula PROP_PER
, O
is O
a O
fairly O
well-known O
place O
. O
I PRON_PER
shall O
enter O
here O
some O
of O
my PRON_PER
notes O
, O
as O
they O
may O
refresh O
my PRON_PER
memory O
when O
I PRON_PER
talk O
over O
my PRON_PER
travels O
with O
Mina PROP_PER
. O
In O
the O
population O
of O
Transylvania O
there O
are O
four O
distinct O
nationalities O
: O
Saxons NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
South NOM_PER
, O
and O
mixed O
with O
them PRON_PER
the NOM_PER
Wallachs NOM_PER
, O
who O
are O
the NOM_PER
descendants NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
Dacians NOM_PER
; O
Magyars O
in O
the O
West O
, O
and O
Szekelys O
in O
the O
East O
and O
North O
. O
I O
am O
going O
among O
the O
latter O
, O
who O
claim O
to O
be O
descended O
from O
Attila O
and O
the O
Huns O
. O
This O
may O
be O
so O
, O
for O
when O
the O
Magyars O
conquered O
the O
country O
in O
the O
eleventh O
century O
they O
found O
the O
Huns O
settled O
in O
it O
. O
I O
read O
that O
every O
known O
superstition O
in O
the O
world O
is O
gathered O
into O
the O
horseshoe O
of O
the O
Carpathians O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
centre O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
imaginative O
whirlpool O
; O
if O
so O
my O
stay O
may O
be O
very O
interesting O
. O
( O
_ O
Mem O
. O
_ O
, O
I O
must O
ask O
the O
Count O
all O
about O
them O
. O
) O
I O
did O
not O
sleep O
well O
, O
though O
my O
bed O
was O
comfortable O
enough O
, O
for O
I O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
queer O
dreams O
. O
There O
was O
a O
dog O
howling O
all O
night O
under O
my O
window O
, O
which O
may O
have O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
; O
or O
it O
may O
have O
been O
the O
paprika O
, O
for O
I O
had O
to O
drink O
up O
all O
the O
water O
in O
my O
carafe O
, O
and O
was O
still O
thirsty O
. O
Towards O
morning O
I O
slept O
and O
was O
wakened O
by O
the O
continuous O
knocking O
at O
my O
door O
, O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
must O
have O
been O
sleeping O
soundly O
then O
. O
I O
had O
for O
breakfast O
more O
paprika O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
porridge O
of O
maize O
flour O
which O
they O
said O
was O
" O
mamaliga O
, O
" O
and O
egg-plant O
stuffed O
with O
forcemeat O
, O
a O
very O
excellent O
dish O
, O
which O
they O
call O
" O
impletata O
. O
" O
( O
_ O
Mem O
. O
_ O
, O
get O
recipe O
for O
this O
also O
. O
) O
I O
had O
to O
hurry O
breakfast O
, O
for O
the O
train O
started O
a O
little O
before O
eight O
, O
or O
rather O
it O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
, O
for O
after O
rushing O
to O
the O
station O
at O
7:30 O
I O
had O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
carriage O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
before O
we O
began O
to O
move O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
further O
east O
you O
go O
the O
more O
unpunctual O
are O
the O
trains O
. O
What O
ought O
they O
to O
be O
in O
China O
? O
All O
day O
long O
we O
seemed O
to O
dawdle O
through O
a O
country O
which O
was O
full O
of O
beauty O
of O
every O
kind O
. O
Sometimes O
we O
saw O
little O
towns O
or O
castles O
on O
the O
top O
of O
steep O
hills O
such O
as O
we O
see O
in O
old O
missals O
; O
sometimes O
we O
ran O
by O
rivers O
and O
streams O
which O
seemed O
from O
the O
wide O
stony O
margin O
on O
each O
side O
of O
them O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
great O
floods O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
, O
and O
running O
strong O
, O
to O
sweep O
the O
outside O
edge O
of O
a O
river O
clear O
. O
At O
every O
station O
there O
were O
groups O
of O
people O
, O
sometimes O
crowds O
, O
and O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
attire O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
were O
just O
like O
the O
peasants O
at O
home O
or O
those O
I O
saw O
coming O
through O
France O
and O
Germany O
, O
with O
short O
jackets O
and O
round O
hats O
and O
home-made O
trousers O
; O
but O
others O
were O
very O
picturesque O
. O
The O
women O
looked O
pretty O
, O
except O
when O
you O
got O
near O
them O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
clumsy O
about O
the O
waist O
. O
They O
had O
all O
full O
white O
sleeves O
of O
some O
kind O
or O
other O
, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
had O
big O
belts O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
strips O
of O
something O
fluttering O
from O
them O
like O
the O
dresses O
in O
a O
ballet O
, O
but O
of O
course O
there O
were O
petticoats O
under O
them O
. O
The O
strangest O
figures O
we O
saw O
were O
the O
Slovaks O
, O
who O
were O
more O
barbarian O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
with O
their O
big O
cow-boy O
hats O
, O
great O
baggy O
dirty-white O
trousers O
, O
white O
linen O
shirts O
, O
and O
enormous O
heavy O
leather O
belts O
, O
nearly O
a O
foot O
wide O
, O
all O
studded O
over O
with O
brass O
nails O
. O
They O
wore O
high O
boots O
, O
with O
their O
trousers O
tucked O
into O
them O
, O
and O
had O
long O
black O
hair O
and O
heavy O
black O
moustaches O
. O
They O
are O
very O
picturesque O
, O
but O
do O
not O
look O
prepossessing O
. O
On O
the O
stage O
they O
would O
be O
set O
down O
at O
once O
as O
some O
old O
Oriental O
band O
of O
brigands O
. O
They O
are O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
very O
harmless O
and O
rather O
wanting O
in O
natural O
self-assertion O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
twilight O
when O
we O
got O
to O
Bistritz O
, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
interesting O
old O
place O
. O
Being O
practically O
on O
the O
frontier O
-- O
for O
the O
Borgo O
Pass O
leads O
from O
it O
into O
Bukovina O
-- O
it O
has O
had O
a O
very O
stormy O
existence O
, O
and O
it O
certainly O
shows O
marks O
of O
it O
. O
Fifty O
years O
ago O
a O
series O
of O
great O
fires O
took O
place O
, O
which O
made O
terrible O
havoc O
on O
five O
separate O
occasions O
. O
At O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
seventeenth O
century O
it O
underwent O
a O
siege O
of O
three O
weeks O
and O
lost O
13,000 O
people O
, O
the O
casualties O
of O
war O
proper O
being O
assisted O
by O
famine O
and O
disease O
. O
Count O
Dracula O
had O
directed O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Golden O
Krone O
Hotel O
, O
which O
I O
found O
, O
to O
my O
great O
delight O
, O
to O
be O
thoroughly O
old-fashioned O
, O
for O
of O
course O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
all O
I O
could O
of O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
country O
. O
I O
was O
evidently O
expected O
, O
for O
when O
I O
got O
near O
the O
door O
I O
faced O
a O
cheery-looking O
elderly O
woman O
in O
the O
usual O
peasant O
dress O
-- O
white O
undergarment O
with O
long O
double O
apron O
, O
front O
, O
and O
back O
, O
of O
coloured O
stuff O
fitting O
almost O
too O
tight O
for O
modesty O
. O
When O
I O
came O
close O
she O
bowed O
and O
said O
, O
" O
The O
Herr O
Englishman O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
Jonathan O
Harker O
. O
" O
She O
smiled O
, O
and O
gave O
some O
message O
to O
an O
elderly O
man O
in O
white O
shirt-sleeves O
, O
who O
had O
followed O
her O
to O
the O
door O
. O
He O
went O
, O
but O
immediately O
returned O
with O
a O
letter O
: O
-- O
" O
My O
Friend O
. O
-- O
Welcome O
to O
the O
Carpathians O
. O
I O
am O
anxiously O
expecting O
you O
. O
Sleep O
well O
to-night O
. O
At O
three O
to-morrow O
the O
diligence O
will O
start O
for O
Bukovina O
; O
a O
place O
on O
it O
is O
kept O
for O
you O
. O
At O
the O
Borgo O
Pass O
my O
carriage O
will O
await O
you O
and O
will O
bring O
you O
to O
me O
. O
I O
trust O
that O
your O
journey O
from O
London O
has O
been O
a O
happy O
one O
, O
and O
that O
you O
will O
enjoy O
your O
stay O

my O
beautiful O
land O

May O

-- O
I O
found O
that O
my O
landlord O
had O
got O
a O
letter O
from O
the O
Count O
, O
directing O
him O
to O
secure O
the O
best O
place O
on O
the O
coach O
for O
me O
; O
but O
on O
making O
inquiries O
as O
to O
details O
he O
seemed O
somewhat O
reticent O
, O
and O
pretended O
that O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
my O
German O
. O
This O
could O
not O
be O
true O
, O
because O
up O
to O
then O
he O
had O
understood O
it O
perfectly O
; O
at O
least O
, O
he O
answered O
my O
questions O
exactly O
as O
if O
he O
did O
. O
He O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
who O
had O
received O
me O
, O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
in O
a O
frightened O
sort O
of O
way O
. O
He O
mumbled O
out O
that O
the O
money O
had O
been O
sent O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
he O
knew O
. O
When O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
knew O
Count O
Dracula O
, O
and O
could O
tell O
me O
anything O
of O
his O
castle O
, O
both O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
crossed O
themselves O
, O
and O
, O
saying O
that O
they O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
simply O
refused O
to O
speak O
further O
. O
It O
was O
so O
near O
the O
time O
of O
starting O
that O
I O
had O
no O
time O
to O
ask O
any O
one O
else O
, O
for O
it O
was O
all O
very O
mysterious O
and O
not O
by O
any O
means O
comforting O
. O
Just O
before O
I O
was O
leaving O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
came O
up O
to O
my O
room O
and O
said O
in O
a O
very O
hysterical O
way O
: O
" O
Must O
you O
go O
? O
Oh O
! O
young O
Herr O
, O
must O
you O
go O
? O
" O
She O
was O
in O
such O
an O
excited O
state O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
her O
grip O
of O
what O
German O
she O
knew O
, O
and O
mixed O
it O
all O
up O
with O
some O
other O
language O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
at O
all O
. O
I O
was O
just O
able O
to O
follow O
her O
by O
asking O
many O
questions O
. O
When O
I O
told O
her O
that O
I O
must O
go O
at O
once O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
engaged O
on O
important O
business O
, O
she O
asked O
again O
: O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
" O
I O
answered O
that O
it O
was O
the O
fourth O
of O
May O
. O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
as O
she O
said O
again O
: O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
I O
know O
that O
! O
I O
know O
that O
, O
but O
do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
" O
On O
my O
saying O
that O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
, O
she O
went O
on O
: O
" O
It O
is O
the O
eve O
of O
St. O
George O
's O
Day O
. O
Do O
you O
not O
know O
that O
to-night O
, O
when O
the O
clock O
strikes O
midnight O
, O
all O
the O
evil O
things O
in O
the O
world O
will O
have O
full O
sway O
? O
Do O
you O
know O
where O
you O
are O
going O
, O
and O
what O
you O
are O
going O
to O
? O
" O
She O
was O
in O
such O
evident O
distress O
that O
I O
tried O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
but O
without O
effect O
. O
Finally O
she O
went O
down O
on O
her O
knees O
and O
implored O
me O
not O
to O
go O
; O
at O
least O
to O
wait O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
starting O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
ridiculous O
but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
. O
However O
, O
there O
was O
business O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
I O
could O
allow O
nothing O
to O
interfere O
with O
it O
. O
I O
therefore O
tried O
to O
raise O
her O
up O
, O
and O
said O
, O
as O
gravely O
as O
I O
could O
, O
that O
I O
thanked O
her O
, O
but O
my O
duty O
was O
imperative O
, O
and O
that O
I O
must O
go O
. O
She O
then O
rose O
and O
dried O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
crucifix O
from O
her O
neck O
offered O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
for O
, O
as O
an O
English O
Churchman O
, O
I O
have O
been O
taught O
to O
regard O
such O
things O
as O
in O
some O
measure O
idolatrous O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
seemed O
so O
ungracious O
to O
refuse O
an O
old O
lady O
meaning O
so O
well O
and O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
. O
She O
saw O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
the O
doubt O
in O
my O
face O
, O
for O
she O
put O
the O
rosary O
round O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
For O
your O
mother O
's O
sake O
, O
" O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
I O
am O
writing O
up O
this O
part O
of O
the O
diary O
whilst O
I O
am O
waiting O
for O
the O
coach O
, O
which O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
late O
; O
and O
the O
crucifix O
is O
still O
round O
my O
neck O
. O
Whether O
it O
is O
the O
old O
lady O
's O
fear O
, O
or O
the O
many O
ghostly O
traditions O
of O
this O
place O
, O
or O
the O
crucifix O
itself O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
feeling O
nearly O
as O
easy O
in O
my O
mind O
as O
usual O
. O
If O
this O
book O
should O
ever O
reach O
Mina O
before O
I O
do O
, O
let O
it O
bring O
my O
good-bye O
. O
Here O
comes O
the O
coach O
! O

I O
The O
day O
broke O
gray O
and O
dull O
. O
The O
clouds O
hung O
heavily O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
rawness O
in O
the O
air O
that O
suggested O
snow O
. O
A NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
servant NOM_PER
came O
into O
a O
room O
in O
which O
a NOM_PER
child NOM_PER
was O
sleeping O
and O
drew O
the O
curtains O
. O
She PRON_PER
glanced O
mechanically O
at O
the O
house O
opposite O
, O
a O
stucco O
house O
with O
a O
portico O
, O
and O
went O
to O
the NOM_PER
child NOM_PER
's O
bed O
. O
" O
Wake O
up O
, O
Philip PROP_PER
, O
" O
she PRON_PER
said O
. O
She PRON_PER
pulled O
down O
the O
bed-clothes O
, O
took O
him PRON_PER
in O
her PRON_PER
arms O
, O
and O
carried O
him PRON_PER
downstairs O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
only O
half O
awake O
. O
" O
Your NOM_PER
mother NOM_PER
wants O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
She O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
a O
room O
on O
the O
floor O
below O
and O
took O
the O
child O
over O
to O
a O
bed O
in O
which O
a O
woman O
was O
lying O
. O
It O
was O
his O
mother O
. O
She O
stretched O
out O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
the O
child O
nestled O
by O
her O
side O
. O
He O
did O
not O
ask O
why O
he O
had O
been O
awakened O
. O
The O
woman O
kissed O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
with O
thin O
, O
small O
hands O
felt O
the O
warm O
body O
through O
his O
white O
flannel O
nightgown O
. O
She O
pressed O
him O
closer O
to O
herself O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
sleepy O
, O
darling O
? O
" O
she O
said O
. O
Her O
voice O
was O
so O
weak O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
come O
already O
from O
a O
great O
distance O
. O
The O
child O
did O
not O
answer O
, O
but O
smiled O
comfortably O
. O
He O
was O
very O
happy O
in O
the O
large O
, O
warm O
bed O
, O
with O
those O
soft O
arms O
about O
him O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
make O
himself O
smaller O
still O
as O
he O
cuddled O
up O
against O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
he O
kissed O
her O
sleepily O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
and O
was O
fast O
asleep O
. O
The O
doctor O
came O
forwards O
and O
stood O
by O
the O
bed-side O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
do O
n't O
take O
him O
away O
yet O
, O
" O
she O
moaned O
. O
The O
doctor O
, O
without O
answering O
, O
looked O
at O
her O
gravely O
. O
Knowing O
she O
would O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
keep O
the O
child O
much O
longer O
, O
the O
woman O
kissed O
him O
again O
; O
and O
she O
passed O
her O
hand O
down O
his O
body O
till O
she O
came O
to O
his O
feet O
; O
she O
held O
the O
right O
foot O
in O
her O
hand O
and O
felt O
the O
five O
small O
toes O
; O
and O
then O
slowly O
passed O
her O
hand O
over O
the O
left O
one O
. O
She O
gave O
a O
sob O
. O
" O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
? O
" O
said O
the O
doctor O
. O
" O
You O
're O
tired O
. O
" O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
the O
tears O
rolled O
down O
her O
cheeks O
. O
The O
doctor O
bent O
down O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
take O
him O
. O
" O
She O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
resist O
his O
wish O
, O
and O
she O
gave O
the O
child O
up O
. O
The O
doctor O
handed O
him O
back O
to O
his O
nurse O
. O
" O
You O
'd O
better O
put O
him O
back O
in O
his O
own O
bed O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
The O
little O
boy O
, O
still O
sleeping O
, O
was O
taken O
away O
. O
His O
mother O
sobbed O
now O
broken-heartedly O
. O
" O
What O
will O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
poor O
child O
? O
" O
The O
monthly O
nurse O
tried O
to O
quiet O
her O
, O
and O
presently O
, O
from O
exhaustion O
, O
the O
crying O
ceased O
. O
The O
doctor O
walked O
to O
a O
table O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room O
, O
upon O
which O
, O
under O
a O
towel O
, O
lay O
the O
body O
of O
a O
still-born O
child O
. O
He O
lifted O
the O
towel O
and O
looked O
. O
He O
was O
hidden O
from O
the O
bed O
by O
a O
screen O
, O
but O
the O
woman O
guessed O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
. O
" O
Was O
it O
a O
girl O
or O
a O
boy O
? O
" O
she O
whispered O
to O
the O
nurse O
. O
" O
Another O
boy O
. O
" O
The O
woman O
did O
not O
answer O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
the O
child O
's O
nurse O
came O
back O
. O
She O
approached O
the O
bed O
. O
" O
Master O
Philip O
never O
woke O
up O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
There O
was O
a O
pause O
. O
Then O
the O
doctor O
felt O
his O
patient O
's O
pulse O
once O
more O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
just O
now O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
call O
again O
after O
breakfast O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'll O
show O
you O
out O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
the O
child O
's O
nurse O
. O
They O
walked O
downstairs O
in O
silence O
. O
In O
the O
hall O
the O
doctor O
stopped O
. O
" O
You O
've O
sent O
for O
Mrs. O
Carey O
's O
brother-in-law O
, O
have O
n't O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
D'you O
know O
at O
what O
time O
he O
'll O
be O
here O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
'm O
expecting O
a O
telegram O
. O
" O
" O
What O
about O
the O
little O
boy O
? O
I O
should O
think O
he O
'd O
be O
better O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Watkin O
said O
she O
'd O
take O
him O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Who O
's O
she O
? O
" O
" O
She O
's O
his O
godmother O
, O
sir O
. O
D'you O
think O
Mrs. O
Carey O
will O
get O
over O
it O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
The O
doctor O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
II O
It O
was O
a O
week O
later O
. O
Philip O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
at O
Miss O
Watkin O
's O
house O
in O
Onslow O
gardens O
. O
He O
was O
an O
only O
child O
and O
used O
to O
amusing O
himself O
. O
The O
room O
was O
filled O
with O
massive O
furniture O
, O
and O
on O
each O
of O
the O
sofas O
were O
three O
big O
cushions O
. O
There O
was O
a O
cushion O
too O
in O
each O
arm-chair O
. O
All O
these O
he O
had O
taken O
and O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
gilt O
rout O
chairs O
, O
light O
and O
easy O
to O
move O
, O
had O
made O
an O
elaborate O
cave O
in O
which O
he O
could O
hide O
himself O
from O
the O
Red O
Indians O
who O
were O
lurking O
behind O
the O
curtains O
. O
He O
put O
his O
ear O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
herd O
of O
buffaloes O
that O
raced O
across O
the O
prairie O
. O
Presently O
, O
hearing O
the O
door O
open O
, O
he O
held O
his O
breath O
so O
that O
he O
might O
not O
be O
discovered O
; O
but O
a O
violent O
hand O
pulled O
away O
a O
chair O
and O
the O
cushions O
fell O
down O
. O
" O
You O
naughty O
boy O
, O
Miss O
Watkin O
WILL O
be O
cross O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Hulloa O
, O
Emma O
! O
" O
he O
said O
. O
The O
nurse O
bent O
down O
and O
kissed O
him O
, O
then O
began O
to O
shake O
out O
the O
cushions O
, O
and O
put O
them O
back O
in O
their O
places O
. O
" O
Am O
I O
to O
come O
home O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
've O
come O
to O
fetch O
you O
. O
" O
" O
You O
've O
got O
a O
new O
dress O
on O
. O
" O
It O
was O
in O
eighteen-eighty-five O
, O
and O
she O
wore O
a O
bustle O
. O
Her O
gown O
was O
of O
black O
velvet O
, O
with O
tight O
sleeves O
and O
sloping O
shoulders O
, O
and O
the O
skirt O
had O
three O
large O
flounces O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
black O
bonnet O
with O
velvet O
strings O
. O
She O
hesitated O
. O
The O
question O
she O
had O
expected O
did O
not O
come O
, O
and O
so O
she O
could O
not O
give O
the O
answer O
she O
had O
prepared O
. O
" O
Are O
n't O
you O
going O
to O
ask O
how O
your O
mamma O
is O
? O
" O
she O
said O
at O
length O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
forgot O
. O
How O
is O
mamma O
? O
" O
Now O
she O
was O
ready O
. O
" O
Your O
mamma O
is O
quite O
well O
and O
happy O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
am O
glad O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
mamma O
's O
gone O
away O
. O
You O
wo O
n't O
ever O
see O
her O
any O
more O
. O
" O
Philip O
did O
not O
know O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Your O
mamma O
's O
in O
heaven O
. O
" O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
, O
and O
Philip O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
quite O
understand O
, O
cried O
too O
. O
Emma O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
big-boned O
woman O
, O
with O
fair O
hair O
and O
large O
features O
. O
She O
came O
from O
Devonshire O
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
her O
many O
years O
of O
service O
in O
London O
, O
had O
never O
lost O
the O
breadth O
of O
her O
accent O
. O
Her O
tears O
increased O
her O
emotion O
, O
and O
she O
pressed O
the O
little O
boy O
to O
her O
heart O
. O
She O
felt O
vaguely O
the O
pity O
of O
that O
child O
deprived O
of O
the O
only O
love O
in O
the O
world O
that O
is O
quite O
unselfish O
. O
It O
seemed O
dreadful O
that O
he O
must O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
strangers O
. O
But O
in O
a O
little O
while O
she O
pulled O
herself O
together O
. O
" O
Your O
Uncle O
William O
is O
waiting O
in O
to O
see O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
Go O
and O
say O
good-bye O
to O
Miss O
Watkin O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
go O
home O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
say O
good-bye O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
instinctively O
anxious O
to O
hide O
his O
tears O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
run O
upstairs O
and O
get O
your O
hat O
. O
" O
He O
fetched O
it O
, O
and O
when O
he O
came O
down O
Emma O
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
in O
the O
hall O
. O
He O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
in O
the O
study O
behind O
the O
dining-room O
. O
He O
paused O
. O
He O
knew O
that O
Miss O
Watkin O
and O
her O
sister O
were O
talking O
to O
friends O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
-- O
he O
was O
nine O
years O
old O
-- O
that O
if O
he O
went O
in O
they O
would O
be O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O
" O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
go O
and O
say O
good-bye O
to O
Miss O
Watkin O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
you O
'd O
better O
, O
" O
said O
Emma O
. O
" O
Go O
in O
and O
tell O
them O
I O
'm O
coming O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
his O
opportunity O
. O
Emma O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
and O
walked O
in O
. O
He O
heard O
her O
speak O
. O
" O
Master O
Philip O
wants O
to O
say O
good-bye O
to O
you O
, O
miss O
. O
" O
There O
was O
a O
sudden O
hush O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
and O
Philip O
limped O
in O
. O
Henrietta O
Watkin O
was O
a O
stout O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
red O
face O
and O
dyed O
hair O
. O
In O
those O
days O
to O
dye O
the O
hair O
excited O
comment O
, O
and O
Philip O
had O
heard O
much O
gossip O
at O
home O
when O
his O
godmother O
's O
changed O
colour O
. O
She O
lived O
with O
an O
elder O
sister O
, O
who O
had O
resigned O
herself O
contentedly O
to O
old O
age O
. O
Two O
ladies O
, O
whom O
Philip O
did O
not O
know O
, O
were O
calling O
, O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
him O
curiously O
. O
" O
My O
poor O
child O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Watkin O
, O
opening O
her O
arms O
. O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
Philip O
understood O
now O
why O
she O
had O
not O
been O
in O
to O
luncheon O
and O
why O
she O
wore O
a O
black O
dress O
. O
She O
could O
not O
speak O
. O
" O
I O
've O
got O
to O
go O
home O
, O
" O
said O
Philip O
, O
at O
last O
. O
He O
disengaged O
himself O
from O
Miss O
Watkin O
's O
arms O
, O
and O
she O
kissed O
him O
again O
. O
Then O
he O
went O
to O
her O
sister O
and O
bade O
her O
good-bye O
too O
. O
One O
of O
the O
strange O
ladies O
asked O
if O
she O
might O
kiss O
him O
, O
and O
he O
gravely O
gave O
her O
permission O
. O
Though O
crying O
, O
he O
keenly O
enjoyed O
the O
sensation O
he O
was O
causing O
; O
he O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
stay O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
be O
made O
much O
of O
, O
but O
felt O
they O
expected O
him O
to O
go O
, O
so O
he O
said O
that O
Emma O
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O
He O
went O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Emma O
had O
gone O
downstairs O
to O
speak O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
basement O
, O
and O
he O
waited O
for O
her O

" O
His O

" O
I O

Then O
one O
of O
the O
strangers O
spoke O

" O
Poor O
little O
boy O

it O

dreadful O
to O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
he O

got O
a O

It O
was O
such O
a O
grief O
to O
his O
mother O

Then O
Emma O
came O
back O

They O
called O
a O
hansom O

and O
she O
told O
the O
driver O
where O
to O
go O

III O
When O
they O
reached O
the O
house O
Mrs. O
Carey O

died O
in O

it O
was O
in O
a O
dreary O
, O
respectable O
street O
between O
Notting O

High O

Kensington O

Emma O
led O
Philip O

One O
of O
them O

The O
Return O
THERE O
WAS O
SOMETHING O
about O
the O
coast O
town O
of O
Dunnet O
which O
made O
it O
seem O
more O
attractive O
than O
other O
maritime O
villages O
of O
eastern O
Maine O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
the O
simple O
fact O
of O
acquaintance O
with O
that O
neighborhood O
which O
made O
it O
so O
attaching O
, O
and O
gave O
such O
interest O
to O
the O
rocky O
shore O
and O
dark O
woods O
, O
and O
the O
few O
houses O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
securely O
wedged O
and O
tree-nailed O
in O
among O
the O
ledges O
by O
the O
Landing O
. O
These O
houses O
made O
the O
most O
of O
their O
seaward O
view O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
gayety O
and O
determined O
floweriness O
in O
their O
bits O
of O
garden O
ground O
; O
the O
small-paned O
high O
windows O
in O
the O
peaks O
of O
their O
steep O
gables O
were O
like O
knowing O
eyes O
that O
watched O
the O
harbor O
and O
the O
far O
sea-line O
beyond O
, O
or O
looked O
northward O
all O
along O
the O
shore O
and O
its O
background O
of O
spruces O
and O
balsam O
firs O
. O
When O
one O
really O
knows O
a O
village O
like O
this O
and O
its O
surroundings O
, O
it O
is O
like O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
a NOM_PER
single NOM_PER
person NOM_PER

The O
process O
of O
falling O
in O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
is O
as O
final O
as O
it O
is O
swift O
in O
such O
a O
case O
, O
but O
the O
growth O
of O
true O
friendship O
may O
be O
a O
lifelong O
affair O
. O
After O
a O
first O
brief O
visit O
made O
two O
or O
three O
summers O

the O

of O

find O
the O

the O
same O
quaintness O
of O
the O
village O
with O
its O
elaborate O
conventionalities O
; O
all O
that O
mixture O
of O
remoteness O
, O
and O
childish O
certainty O
of O
being O
the O
centre O
of O
civilization O
of O
which O
her PRON_PER
affectionate O
dreams O

One O
evening O
in O

, O
a NOM_PER

upon O
the O

LATER O
, O
THERE O
WAS O
only O
one O
fault O
to O
find O
with O
this O
choice O
of O
a O
summer O
lodging-place O
, O
and O
that O
was O
its O
complete O
lack O
of O
seclusion O
. O
At O
first O
the O
tiny O
house O
of O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Almira PROP_PER
Todd PROP_PER
, O
which O
stood O
with O
its O
end O
to O
the O
street O
, O
appeared O
to O
be O
retired O
and O
sheltered O
enough O
from O
the O
busy O
world O
, O
behind O
its O
bushy O
bit O
of O
a O
green O
garden O
, O
in O
which O
all O
the O
blooming O
things O
, O
two O
or O
three O
gay O
hollyhocks O
and O
some O
London-pride O
, O
were O
pushed O
back O
against O
the O
gray-shingled O
wall O
. O
It O
was O
a O
queer O
little O
garden O
and O
puzzling O
to O
a NOM_PER
stranger NOM_PER
, O
the O
few O
flowers O
being O
put O
at O
a O
disadvantage O
by O
so O
much O
greenery O
; O
but O
the O
discovery O
was O
soon O
made O
that O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Todd PROP_PER
was O
an O
ardent O
lover O
of O
herbs O
, O
both O
wild O
and O
tame O
, O
and O
the O
sea-breezes O
blew O
into O
the O
low O
end-window O
of O
the O
house O
laden O
with O
not O
only O
sweet-brier O
and O
sweet-mary O
, O
but O
balm O
and O
sage O
and O
borage O
and O
mint O
, O
wormwood O
and O
southernwood O
. O
If O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Todd PROP_PER
had O
occasion O
to O
step O
into O
the O
far O
corner O
of O
her PRON_PER
herb O
plot O
, O
she PRON_PER
trod O
heavily O
upon O
thyme O
, O
and O
made O
its O
fragrant O
presence O
known O
with O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
Being O
a NOM_PER
very NOM_PER
large NOM_PER
person NOM_PER
, O
her PRON_PER
full O
skirts O
brushed O
and O
bent O
almost O
every O
slender O
stalk O
that O
her PRON_PER
feet O
missed O
. O
You PRON_PER
could O
always O
tell O
when O
she PRON_PER
was O
stepping O
about O
there O
, O
even O
when O
you PRON_PER
were O
half O
awake O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
know O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
’ O
experience O
, O
in O
exactly O
which O
corner O
of O
the O
garden O
she O
might O
be O
. O
At O
one O
side O
of O
this O
herb O
plot O
were O
other O
growths O
of O
a O
rustic O
pharmacopoeia O
, O
great O
treasures O
and O
rarities O
among O
the O
commoner O
herbs O
. O
There O
were O
some O
strange O
and O
pungent O
odors O
that O
roused O
a O
dim O
sense O
and O
remembrance O
of O
something O
in O
the O
forgotten O
past O
. O
Some O
of O
these O
might O
once O
have O
belonged O
to O
sacred O
and O
mystic O
rites O
, O
and O
have O
had O
some O
occult O
knowledge O
handed O
with O
them O
down O
the O
centuries O
; O
but O
now O
they O
pertained O
only O
to O
humble O
compounds O
brewed O
at O
intervals O
with O
molasses O
or O
vinegar O
or O
spirits O
in O
a O
small O
caldron O
on O
Mrs. O
Todd O
’s O
kitchen O
stove O
. O
They O
were O
dispensed O
to O
suffering O
neighbors O
, O
who O
usually O
came O
at O
night O
as O
if O
by O
stealth O
, O
bringing O
their O
own O
ancient-looking O
vials O
to O
be O
filled O
. O
One O
nostrum O
was O
called O
the O
Indian O
remedy O
, O
and O
its O
price O
was O
but O
fifteen O
cents O
; O
the O
whispered O
directions O
could O
be O
heard O
as O
customers O
passed O
the O
windows O
. O
With O
most O
remedies O
the O
purchaser O
was O
allowed O
to O
depart O
unadmonished O
from O
the O
kitchen O
, O
Mrs. O
Todd O
being O
a O
wise O
saver O
of O
steps O
; O
but O
with O
certain O
vials O
she O
gave O
cautions O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
doorway O
, O
and O
there O
were O
other O
doses O
which O
had O
to O
be O
accompanied O
on O
their O
healing O
way O
as O
far O
as O
the O
gate O
, O
while O
she O
muttered O
long O
chapters O
of O
directions O
, O
and O
kept O
up O
an O
air O
of O
secrecy O
and O
importance O
to O
the O
last O
. O
It O
may O
not O
have O
been O
only O
the O
common O
aids O
of O
humanity O
with O
which O
she O
tried O
to O
cope O
; O
it O
seemed O
sometimes O
as O
if O
love O
and O
hate O
and O
jealousy O
and O
adverse O
winds O
at O
sea O
might O
also O
find O
their O
proper O
remedies O
among O
the O
curious O
wild-looking O
plants O
in O
Mrs. O
Todd O
’s O
garden O
. O
The O
village O
doctor O
and O
this O
learned O
herbalist O
were O
upon O
the O
best O
of O
terms O
. O
The O
good O
man O
may O
have O
counted O
upon O
the O
unfavorable O
effect O
of O
certain O
potions O
which O
he O
should O
find O
his O
opportunity O
in O
counteracting O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
he O
now O
and O
then O
stopped O
and O
exchanged O
greetings O
with O
Mrs. O
Todd O
over O
the O
picket O
fence O
. O
The O
conversation O
became O
at O
once O
professional O
after O
the O
briefest O
preliminaries O
, O
and O
he O
would O
stand O
twirling O
a O
sweet-scented O
sprig O
in O
his O
fingers O
, O
and O
make O
suggestive O
jokes O
, O
perhaps O
about O
her O
faith O
in O
a O
too O
persistent O
course O
of O
thoroughwort O
elixir O
, O
in O
which O
my O
landlady O
professed O
such O
firm O
belief O
as O
sometimes O
to O
endanger O
the O
life O
and O
usefulness O
of O
worthy O
neighbors O
. O
To O
arrive O
at O
this O
quietest O
of O
seaside O
villages O
late O
in O
June O
, O
when O
the O
busy O
herb-gathering O
season O
was O
just O
beginning O
, O
was O
also O
to O
arrive O
in O
the O
early O
prime O
of O
Mrs. O
Todd O
’s O
activity O
in O
the O
brewing O
of O
old-fashioned O
spruce O
beer O
. O
This O
cooling O
and O
refreshing O
drink O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
wonderful O
perfection O
through O
a O
long O
series O
of O
experiments O
; O
it O
had O
won O
immense O
local O
fame O
, O
and O
the O
supplies O
for O
its O
manufacture O
were O
always O
giving O
out O
and O
having O
to O
be O
replenished O
. O
For O
various O
reasons O
, O
the O
seclusion O
and O
uninterrupted O
days O
which O
had O
been O
looked O
forward O
to O
proved O
to O
be O
very O
rare O
in O
this O
otherwise O
delightful O
corner O
of O
the O
world O
. O
My O
hostess O
and O
I O
had O
made O
our O
shrewd O
business O
agreement O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
simple O
cold O
luncheon O
at O
noon O
, O
and O
liberal O
restitution O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
hot O
suppers O
, O
to O
provide O
for O
which O
the O
lodger O
might O
sometimes O
be O
seen O
hurrying O
down O
the O
road O
, O
late O
in O
the O
day O
, O
with O
cunner O
line O
in O
hand O
. O
It O
was O
soon O
found O
that O
this O
arrangement O
made O
large O
allowance O
for O
Mrs. O
Todd O
’s O
slow O
herb-gathering O
progresses O
through O
woods O
and O
pastures O
. O
The O
spruce-beer O
customers O
were O
pretty O
steady O
in O
hot O
weather O
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
demands O
for O
different O
soothing O
syrups O
and O
elixirs O
with O
which O
the O
unwise O
curiosity O
of O
my O
early O
residence O
had O
made O
me O
acquainted O
. O
Knowing O
Mrs. O
Todd O
to O
be O
a O
widow O
, O
who O
had O
little O
beside O
this O
slender O
business O
and O
the O
income O
from O
one O
hungry O
lodger O
to O
maintain O
her O
, O
one O
’s O
energies O
and O
even O
interest O
were O
quickly O
bestowed O
, O
until O
it O
became O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
that O
she O
should O
go O
afield O
every O
pleasant O
day O
, O
and O
that O
the O
lodger O
should O
answer O
all O
peremptory O
knocks O
at O
the O
side O
door O
. O
In O
taking O
an O
occasional O
wisdom-giving O
stroll O
in O
Mrs. O
Todd O
’s O
company O
, O
and O
in O
acting O
as O
business O
partner O
during O
her O
frequent O
absences O
, O
I O
found O
the O
July O
days O
fly O
fast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
I O
felt O
myself O
confronted O
with O
too O
great O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
display O
, O
one O
night O
, O
of O
two O
dollars O
and O
twenty-seven O
cents O
which O
I O
had O
taken O
in O
during O
the O
day O
, O
that O
I O
remembered O
a O
long O
piece O
of O
writing O
, O
sadly O
belated O
now O
, O
which O
I O
was O
bound O
to O
do O
. O
To O
have O
been O
patted O
kindly O
on O
the O
shoulder O
and O
called O
" O
darlin O
’ O
, O
" O
to O
have O
been O
offered O
a O
surprise O
of O
early O
mushrooms O
for O
supper O
, O
to O
have O
had O
all O
the O
glory O
of O
making O
two O
dollars O
and O
twenty-seven O
cents O
in O
a O
single O
day O
, O
and O
then O
to O
renounce O
it O
all O
and O
withdraw O
from O
these O
pleasant O
successes O
, O
needed O
much O
resolution O
. O
Literary O
employments O
are O
so O
vexed O
with O
uncertainties O
at O
best O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
the O
voice O
of O
conscience O
sounded O
louder O
in O
my O
ears O
than O
the O
sea O
on O
the O
nearest O
pebble O
beach O
that O
I O
said O
unkind O
words O
of O
withdrawal O
to O
Mrs. O
Todd O
. O
She O
only O
became O
more O
wistfully O
affectionate O
than O
ever O
in O
her O
expressions O
, O
and O
looked O
as O
disappointed O
as O
I O
expected O
when O
I O
frankly O
told O
her O
that O
I O
could O
no O
longer O
enjoy O
the O
pleasure O
of O
what O
we O
called O
" O
seein O
’ O
folks O
. O
" O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
cruel O
to O
a O
whole O
neighborhood O
in O
curtailing O
her O
liberty O
in O
this O
most O
important O
season O
for O
harvesting O
the O
different O
wild O
herbs O
that O
were O
so O
much O
counted O
upon O
to O
ease O
their O
winter O
ails O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
dear O
, O
" O
she O
said O
sorrowfully O
, O
" O
I O
’ve O
took O
great O
advantage O

your O
bein O

a O
season O

I O

never O

nobody O

so O
trust O

All O
you O
lack O
is O
a O
few O
qualities O
, O
but O
with O
time O
you O
’d O
gain O
judgment O
an O

able O

I O
’d O
stand O
right O
here O

’ O
say O
it O
to O
anybody O

" O
Mrs. O
Todd O
and O
I O
were O
not O
separated O
or O
estranged O
by O
the O
change O
in O
our O
business O
relations O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
a O
deeper O
intimacy O
seemed O
to O
begin O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
herb O
of O
the O
night O
it O
was O
that O
used O
sometimes O
to O
send O
out O
a O
penetrating O
odor O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
after O
the O
dew O
had O
fallen O
, O
and O
the O
moon O
was O
high O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
air O
came O
up O
from O
the O
sea O
. O
Then O
Mrs. O
Todd O
would O
feel O
that O
she O
must O
talk O
to O
somebody O
, O
and O
I O
was O
only O
too O
glad O
to O
listen O
. O
We O
both O
fell O
under O
the O
spell O
, O
and O
she O
either O
stood O
outside O
the O
window O
, O
or O
made O
an O
errand O
to O
my O
sitting-room O
, O
and O
told O
, O
it O
might O
be O
very O
commonplace O
news O
of O
the O
day O
, O
or O
, O

CHAPTER O
ONE O
THE O
EVE O
OF O
THE O
WAR O
No NOM_PER
one NOM_PER
would O
have O
believed O
in O
the O
last O
years O
of O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
that O
this O
world O
was O
being O
watched O
keenly O
and O
closely O
by O
intelligences O
greater O
than O
man NOM_PER
's O
and O
yet O
as O
mortal O
as O
his PRON_PER
own O
; O
that O
as O
men NOM_PER
busied O
themselves PRON_PER
about O
their PRON_PER
various O
concerns O
they PRON_PER
were O
scrutinised O
and O
studied O
, O
perhaps O
almost O
as O
narrowly O
as O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
microscope NOM_PER
might O
scrutinise O
the O
transient O
creatures O
that O
swarm O
and O
multiply O
in O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
. O
With O
infinite O
complacency O
men NOM_PER
went O
to O
and O
fro O
over O
this O
globe O
about O
their PRON_PER
little O
affairs O
, O
serene O
in O
their PRON_PER
assurance O
of O
their PRON_PER
empire O
over O
matter O
. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
infusoria O
under O
the O
microscope O
do O
the O
same O
. O
No NOM_PER
one NOM_PER
gave O
a O
thought O
to O
the O
older O
worlds O
of O
space O
as O
sources O
of O
human O
danger O
, O
or O
thought O
of O
them O
only O
to O
dismiss O
the O
idea O
of O
life O
upon O
them O
as O
impossible O
or O
improbable O
. O
It O
is O
curious O
to O
recall O
some O
of O
the O
mental O
habits O
of O
those O
departed O
days O
. O
At O
most O
terrestrial NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
fancied O
there O
might O
be O
other NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
upon O
Mars O
, O
perhaps O
inferior O
to O
themselves PRON_PER
and O
ready O
to O
welcome O
a O
missionary O
enterprise O
. O
Yet O
across O
the O
gulf O
of O
space O
, O
minds O
that O
are O
to O
our PRON_PER
minds O
as O
ours O
are O
to O
those O
of O
the O
beasts O
that O
perish O
, O
intellects O
vast O
and O
cool O
and O
unsympathetic O
, O
regarded O
this O
earth O
with O
envious O
eyes O
, O
and O
slowly O
and O
surely O
drew O
their PRON_PER
plans O
against O
us PRON_PER
. O
And O
early O
in O
the O
twentieth O
century O
came O
the O
great O
disillusionment O
. O
The O
planet O
Mars O
, O
I PRON_PER
scarcely O
need O
remind O
the NOM_PER
reader NOM_PER
, O
revolves O
about O
the O
sun O
at O
a O
mean O
distance O
of O
140,000,000 O
miles O
, O
and O
the O
light O
and O
heat O
it O
receives O
from O
the O
sun O
is O
barely O
half O
of O
that O
received O
by O
this O
world O
. O
It O
must O
be O
, O
if O
the O
nebular O
hypothesis O
has O
any O
truth O
, O
older O
than O
our PRON_PER
world O
; O
and O
long O
before O
this O
earth O
ceased O
to O
be O
molten O
, O
life O
upon O
its O
surface O
must O
have O
begun O
its O
course O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
scarcely O
one O
seventh O
of O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
earth O
must O
have O
accelerated O
its O
cooling O
to O
the O
temperature O
at O
which O
life O
could O
begin O
. O
It O
has O
air O
and O
water O
and O
all O
that O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
support O
of O
animated O
existence O
. O
Yet O
so O
vain O
is O
man NOM_PER
, O
and O
so O
blinded O
by O
his PRON_PER
vanity O
, O
that O
no NOM_PER
writer NOM_PER
, O
up O
to O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
, O
expressed O
any O
idea O
that O
intelligent O
life O
might O
have O
developed O
there O
far O
, O
or O
indeed O
at O
all O
, O
beyond O
its O
earthly O
level O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
generally O
understood O
that O
since O
Mars O
is O
older O
than O
our PRON_PER
earth O
, O
with O
scarcely O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
superficial O
area O
and O
remoter O
from O
the O
sun O
, O
it O
necessarily O
follows O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
more O
distant O
from O
time O
's O
beginning O
but O
nearer O
its O
end O
. O
The O
secular O
cooling O
that O
must O
someday O
overtake O
our PRON_PER
planet O
has O
already O
gone O
far O
indeed O
with O
our PRON_PER
neighbour O
. O
Its O
physical O
condition O
is O
still O
largely O
a O
mystery O
, O
but O
we PRON_PER
know O
now O
that O
even O
in O
its O
equatorial O
region O
the O
midday O
temperature O
barely O
approaches O
that O
of O
our PRON_PER
coldest O
winter O
. O
Its O
air O
is O
much O
more O
attenuated O
than O
ours O
, O
its O
oceans O
have O
shrunk O
until O
they O
cover O
but O
a O
third O
of O
its O
surface O
, O
and O
as O
its O
slow O
seasons O
change O
huge O
snowcaps O
gather O
and O
melt O
about O
either O
pole O
and O
periodically O
inundate O
its O
temperate O
zones O
. O
That O
last O
stage O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
which O
to O
us PRON_PER
is O
still O
incredibly O
remote O
, O
has O
become O
a O
present-day O
problem O
for O
the NOM_PER
inhabitants NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
Mars NOM_PER
. O
The O
immediate O
pressure O
of O
necessity O
has O
brightened O
their PRON_PER
intellects O
, O
enlarged O
their PRON_PER
powers O
, O
and O
hardened O
their PRON_PER
hearts O
. O
And O
looking O
across O
space O
with O
instruments O
, O
and O
intelligences O
such O
as O
we PRON_PER
have O
scarcely O
dreamed O
of O
, O
they PRON_PER
see O
, O
at O
its O
nearest O
distance O
only O
35,000,000 O
of O
miles O
sunward O
of O
them PRON_PER
, O
a O
morning O
star O
of O
hope O
, O
our PRON_PER
own O
warmer O
planet O
, O
green O
with O
vegetation O
and O
grey O
with O
water O
, O
with O
a O
cloudy O
atmosphere O
eloquent O
of O
fertility O
, O
with O
glimpses O
through O
its O
drifting O
cloud O
wisps O
of O
broad O
stretches O
of O
populous O
country O
and O
narrow O
, O
navy-crowded O
seas O
. O
And O
we NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
, O
the O
creatures O
who O
inhabit O
this O
earth O
, O
must O
be O
to O
them O
at O
least O
as O
alien O
and O
lowly O
as O
are O
the O
monkeys O
and O
lemurs O
to O
us O
. O
The O
intellectual O
side O
of O
man O
already O
admits O
that O
life O
is O
an O
incessant O
struggle O
for O
existence O
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
this O
too O
is O
the O
belief O
of O
the O
minds O
upon O
Mars O
. O
Their O
world O
is O
far O
gone O
in O
its O
cooling O
and O
this O
world O
is O
still O
crowded O
with O
life O
, O
but O
crowded O
only O
with O
what O
they O
regard O
as O
inferior O
animals O
. O
To O
carry O
warfare O
sunward O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
their O
only O
escape O
from O
the O
destruction O
that O
, O
generation O
after O
generation O
, O
creeps O
upon O
them O
. O
And O
before O
we O
judge O
of O
them O
too O
harshly O
we O
must O
remember O
what O
ruthless O
and O
utter O
destruction O
our O
own O
species O
has O
wrought O
, O
not O
only O
upon O
animals O
, O
such O
as O
the O
vanished O
bison O
and O
the O
dodo O
, O
but O
upon O
its O
inferior O
races O
. O
The O
Tasmanians O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
human O
likeness O
, O
were O
entirely O
swept O
out O
of O
existence O
in O
a O
war O
of O
extermination O
waged O
by O
European O
immigrants O
, O
in O
the O
space O
of O
fifty O
years O
. O
Are O
we O
such O
apostles O
of O
mercy O
as O
to O
complain O
if O
the O
Martians O
warred O
in O
the O
same O
spirit O
? O
The O
Martians O
seem O
to O
have O
calculated O
their O
descent O
with O
amazing O
subtlety O
-- O
their O
mathematical O
learning O
is O
evidently O
far O
in O
excess O
of O
ours O
-- O
and O
to O
have O
carried O
out O
their O
preparations O
with O
a O
well-nigh O
perfect O
unanimity O
. O
Had O
our O
instruments O
permitted O
it O
, O
we O
might O
have O
seen O
the O
gathering O
trouble O
far O
back O
in O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
. O
Men O
like O
Schiaparelli O
watched O
the O
red O
planet O
-- O
it O
is O
odd O
, O
by-the-bye O
, O
that O
for O
countless O
centuries O
Mars O
has O
been O
the O
star O
of O
war O
-- O
but O
failed O
to O
interpret O
the O
fluctuating O
appearances O
of O
the O
markings O
they O
mapped O
so O
well O
. O
All O
that O
time O
the O
Martians O
must O
have O
been O
getting O
ready O
. O
During O
the O
opposition O
of O
1894 O
a O
great O
light O
was O
seen O
on O
the O
illuminated O
part O
of O
the O
disk O
, O
first O
at O
the O
Lick O
Observatory O
, O
then O
by O
Perrotin O
of O
Nice O
, O
and O
then O
by O
other O
observers O
. O
English O
readers O
heard O
of O
it O
first O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
_ O
Nature O
_ O
dated O
August O
2 O
. O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
this O
blaze O
may O
have O
been O
the O
casting O
of O
the O
huge O
gun O
, O
in O
the O
vast O
pit O
sunk O
into O
their O
planet O
, O
from O
which O
their O
shots O
were O
fired O
at O
us O
. O
Peculiar O
markings O
, O
as O
yet O
unexplained O
, O
were O
seen O
near O
the O
site O
of O
that O
outbreak O
during O
the O
next O
two O
oppositions O
. O
The O
storm O
burst O
upon O
us O
six O
years O
ago O
now O
. O
As O
Mars O
approached O
opposition O
, O
Lavelle O
of O
Java O
set O
the O
wires O
of O
the O
astronomical O
exchange O
palpitating O
with O
the O
amazing O
intelligence O
of O
a O
huge O
outbreak O
of O
incandescent O
gas O
upon O
the O
planet O
. O
It O
had O
occurred O
towards O
midnight O
of O
the O
twelfth O
; O
and O
the O
spectroscope O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
at O
once O
resorted O
, O
indicated O
a O
mass O
of O
flaming O
gas O
, O
chiefly O
hydrogen O
, O
moving O
with O
an O
enormous O
velocity O
towards O
this O
earth O
. O
This O
jet O
of O
fire O
had O
become O
invisible O
about O
a O
quarter O
past O
twelve O
. O
He O
compared O
it O
to O
a O
colossal O
puff O
of O
flame O
suddenly O
and O
violently O
squirted O
out O
of O
the O
planet O
, O
" O
as O
flaming O
gases O
rushed O
out O
of O
a O
gun O
. O
" O
A O
singularly O
appropriate O
phrase O
it O
proved O
. O
Yet O
the O
next O
day O
there O
was O
nothing O
of O
this O
in O
the O
papers O
except O
a O
little O
note O
in O
the O
_ O
Daily O
Telegraph O
_ O
, O
and O
the O
world O
went O
in O
ignorance O
of O
one O
of O
the O
gravest O
dangers O
that O
ever O
threatened O
the O
human O
race O
. O
I O
might O
not O
have O
heard O
of O
the O
eruption O
at O
all O
had O
I O
not O
met O
Ogilvy O
, O
the O
well-known O
astronomer O
, O
at O
Ottershaw O
. O
He O
was O
immensely O
excited O
at O
the O
news O
, O
and O
in O
the O
excess O
of O
his O
feelings O
invited O
me O
up O
to O
take O
a O
turn O
with O
him O
that O
night O
in O
a O
scrutiny O
of O
the O
red O
planet O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
all O
that O
has O
happened O
since O
, O
I O
still O
remember O
that O
vigil O
very O
distinctly O
: O
the O
black O
and O
silent O
observatory O
, O
the O
shadowed O
lantern O
throwing O
a O
feeble O
glow O
upon O
the O
floor O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
the O
steady O
ticking O
of O
the O
clockwork O
of O
the O
telescope O
, O
the O
little O
slit O
in O
the O
roof O
-- O
an O
oblong O
profundity O
with O
the O
stardust O
streaked O
across O
it O
. O
Ogilvy O
moved O
about O
, O
invisible O
but O
audible O
. O
Looking O
through O
the O
telescope O
, O
one O
saw O
a O
circle O
of O
deep O
blue O
and O
the O
little O
round O
planet O
swimming O
in O
the O
field O
. O
It O
seemed O
such O
a O
little O
thing O
, O
so O
bright O
and O
small O
and O
still O
, O
faintly O
marked O
with O
transverse O
stripes O
, O
and O
slightly O
flattened O
from O
the O
perfect O
round O
. O
But O
so O
little O
it O
was O
, O
so O
silvery O
warm O
-- O
a O
pin O
's O
- O
head O
of O
light O
! O
It O
was O
as O
if O
it O
quivered O
, O
but O
really O
this O
was O
the O
telescope O
vibrating O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
clockwork O
that O
kept O
the O
planet O
in O
view O
. O
As O
I O
watched O
, O
the O
planet O
seemed O
to O
grow O
larger O
and O
smaller O
and O
to O
advance O
and O
recede O
, O
but O
that O
was O
simply O
that O
my O
eye O
was O
tired O
. O
Forty O
millions O
of O
miles O
it O
was O
from O
us O
-- O
more O
than O
forty O
millions O
of O
miles O
of O
void O
. O
Few O
people O
realise O
the O
immensity O
of O
vacancy O
in O
which O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
material O
universe O
swims O
. O
Near O
it O
in O
the O
field O
, O
I O
remember O
, O
were O
three O
faint O
points O
of O
light O
, O
three O
telescopic O
stars O
infinitely O
remote O
, O
and O
all O
around O
it O
was O
the O
unfathomable O
darkness O
of O
empty O
space O
. O
You O
know O
how O
that O
blackness O
looks O
on O
a O
frosty O
starlight O
night O
. O
In O
a O
telescope O
it O
seems O
far O
profounder O
. O
And O
invisible O
to O
me O
because O
it O
was O
so O
remote O
and O
small O
, O
flying O
swiftly O
and O
steadily O
towards O
me O
across O
that O
incredible O
distance O
, O
drawing O
nearer O
every O
minute O
by O
so O
many O
thousands O
of O
miles O
, O
came O
the O
Thing O
they O
were O
sending O
us O
, O
the O
Thing O
that O
was O
to O
bring O
so O
much O
struggle O
and O
calamity O
and O
death O
to O
the O
earth O
. O
I O
never O
dreamed O
of O
it O
then O
as O
I O
watched O
; O
no O
one O
on O
earth O
dreamed O
of O
that O
unerring O
missile O
. O
That O
night O
, O
too O
, O
there O
was O
another O
jetting O
out O
of O
gas O
from O
the O
distant O
planet O
. O
I O
saw O
it O
. O
A O
reddish O
flash O
at O
the O
edge O
, O
the O
slightest O
projection O
of O
the O
outline O
just O
as O
the O
chronometer O
struck O
midnight O
; O
and O
at O
that O
I O
told O
Ogilvy O
and O
he O
took O
my O
place O
. O
The O
night O
was O
warm O
and O
I O
was O
thirsty O
, O
and O
I O
went O
stretching O
my O
legs O
clumsily O
and O
feeling O
my O
way O
in O
the O
darkness O
, O
to O
the O
little O
table O
where O
the O
siphon O
stood O
, O
while O
Ogilvy O
exclaimed O
at O
the O
streamer O
of O
gas O
that O
came O
out O
towards O
us O
. O
That O
night O
another O
invisible O
missile O
started O
on O
its O
way O
to O
the O
earth O
from O
Mars O
, O
just O
a O
second O
or O
so O
under O
twenty-four O
hours O
after O
the O
first O
one O
. O
I O
remember O
how O
I O
sat O
on O
the O
table O
there O
in O
the O
blackness O
, O
with O
patches O
of O
green O
and O
crimson O
swimming O
before O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
wished O
I O
had O
a O
light O
to O
smoke O
by O
, O
little O
suspecting O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
minute O
gleam O
I O
had O
seen O
and O
all O
that O
it O
would O
presently O
bring O
me O
. O
Ogilvy O
watched O
till O
one O
, O
and O
then O
gave O
it O
up O
; O
and O
we O
lit O
the O
lantern O
and O
walked O
over O
to O
his O
house O
. O
Down O
below O
in O
the O
darkness O
were O
Ottershaw O
and O
Chertsey O
and O
all O
their O
hundreds O
of O
people O
, O
sleeping O
in O
peace O
. O
He O
was O
full O
of O
speculation O
that O
night O
about O
the O
condition O
of O
Mars O
, O
and O
scoffed O
at O
the O
vulgar O
idea O
of O
its O
having O
inhabitants O
who O
were O
signalling O
us O
. O
His O
idea O
was O
that O
meteorites O
might O
be O
falling O
in O
a O
heavy O
shower O
upon O
the O
planet O
, O
or O
that O
a O
huge O
volcanic O
explosion O
was O
in O
progress O
. O
He O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
how O
unlikely O
it O
was O
that O
organic O
evolution O
had O
taken O
the O
same O
direction O
in O
the O
two O
adjacent O
planets O
. O

CHAPTER O
1 O
Mrs PROP_PER
Gildea PROP_PER
had O
settled O
early O
to O
her PRON_PER
morning O
's O
work O
in O
what O
she PRON_PER
called O
the O
veranda-study O
of O
her PRON_PER
cottage O
in O
Leichardt O
's O
Town O
. O
It O
was O
a O
primitive O
cottage O
of O
the O
old O
style O
, O
standing O
in O
a O
garden O
and O
built O
on O
the O
cliff O
-- O
the O
Emu O
Point O
side O
-- O
overlooking O
the O
broad O
Leichardt O
River O
. O
The O
veranda O
, O
quite O
twelve O
feet O
wide O
, O
ran O
-- O
Australian O
fashion O
-- O
along O
the O
front O
of O
the O
cottage O
, O
except O
for O
the O
two O
closed-in O
ends O
forming O
, O
one O
a O
bathroom O
and O
the O
other O
a O
kind O
of O
store O
closet O
. O
Being O
raised O
a O
few O
feet O
above O
the O
ground O
, O
the O
veranda O
was O
enclosed O
by O
a O
wooden O
railing O
, O
and O
this O
and O
the O
supporting O
posts O
were O
twined O
with O
creepers O
that O
must O
have O
been O
planted O
at O
least O
thirty O
years O
. O
One O
of O
these O
, O
a O
stephanotis O
, O
showed O
masses O
of O
white O
bloom O
, O
which O
Joan PROP_PER
Gildea PROP_PER
casually O
reflected O
would O
have O
fetched O
a O
pretty O
sum O
in O
Covent O
Garden O
, O
and O
, O
joining O
in O
with O
a O
fine-growing O
asparagus O
fern O
, O
formed O
an O
arch O
over O
the O
entrance O
steps O
. O
The O
end O
of O
the O
veranda O
, O
where O
Mrs PROP_PER
Gildea PROP_PER
had O
established O
herself PRON_PER
with O
her PRON_PER
type-writer O
and O
paraphernalia O
of O
literary O
work O
, O
was O
screened O
by O
a O
thick-stemmed O
grape-vine O
, O
which O
made O
a O
dapple O
of O
shadow O
and O
sunshine O
upon O
the O
boarded O
floor O
. O
Some O
bunches O
of O
late O
grapes O
-- O
it O
was O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
March O
-- O
hung O
upon O
the O
vine O
, O
and O
, O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
veranda O
, O
grew O
a O
passion O
creeper O
, O
its O
great O
purple O
fruit O
looking O
like O
huge O
plums O
amidst O
its O
vivid O
green O
leaves O
. O
The O
roof O
of O
the O
veranda O
was O
low O
, O
with O
projecting O
eaves O
, O
below O
which O
a O
bunch O
of O
yellowing O
bananas O
hung O
to O
ripen O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
the O
veranda O
and O
garden O
beyond O
would O
have O
been O
paradise O
to O
a O
fruitarian O
. O
Against O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
store-room O
, O
stood O
a O
large O
tin O
dish O
piled O
with O
melons O
, O
pine-apples O
and O
miscellaneous O
garden O
produce O
, O
while O
, O
between O
the O
veranda O
posts O
, O
could O
be O
seen O
a O
guava-tree O
, O
an O
elderly O
fig O
and O
a O
loquat O
all O
in O
full O
bearing O
. O
The O
garden O
seemed O
a O
tangle O
of O
all O
manner O
of O
vegetation O
-- O
an O
oleander O
in O
bloom O
, O
a O
poinsettia O
, O
a O
yucca O
, O
lifting O
its O
spike O
of O
waxen O
white O
blossoms O
, O
a O
narrow O
flower-border O
in O
which O
the O
gardenias O
had O
become O
tall O
shrubs O
and O
the O
scented O
verbena O
shrubs O
almost O
trees O
. O
As O
for O
the O
blend O
of O
perfume O
, O
it O
was O
dreamily O
intoxicating O
. O
Two O
bamboos O
, O
guarding O
the O
side O
entrance O
gate O
, O
made O
a O
soft O
whispering O
that O
heightened O
the O
dream-sense O
. O
The O
bottom O
of O
the O
garden O
looked O
an O
inchoate O
mass O
of O
greenery O
topped O
by O
the O
upper O
boughs O
of O
tall O
straggling O
gum O
trees O
, O
growing O
outside O
where O
the O
ground O
fell O
gradually O
to O
the O
river O
. O
From O
where O
Mrs PROP_PER
Gildea PROP_PER
sat O
, O
she PRON_PER
had O
a O
view O
of O
almost O
the O
whole O
reach O
of O
the O
river O
where O
it O
circles O
Emu O
Point O
. O
For O
, O
as O
is O
known O
to O
all O
who O
know O
Leichardt O
's O
Town O
, O
the O
river O
winds O
in O
two O
great O
loops O
girdling O
two O
low O
points O
, O
so O
that O
, O
in O
striking O
a O
bee-line O
across O
the O
whole O
town O
, O
business O
and O
residential O
, O
one O
must O
cross O
the O
river O
three O
times O
. O
Mrs PROP_PER
Gildea PROP_PER
could O
see O
the O
plan O
of O
the O
main O
street O
in O
the O
Middle O
Point O
and O
the O
roofs O
of O
shops O
and O
offices O
. O
The O
busy O
wharves O
of O
the O
Leichardt O

Land O

familiarly O
, O
the O
L.L.S.N. O

lay O
opposite O
on O
her PRON_PER
right O
, O
while O
leftward O
, O
across O
the O
water O
, O
she PRON_PER
could O
trace O
, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
grape-vine O
would O
allow O
, O
the O
boundary O
of O
the O
Botanical O

a O
sight O
of O
the O
white O
stone O
and O
grey O
slate O
end O
of O
the O
big O
Parliamentary O
Buildings O
. O
The O
heat-haze O
over O
the O
town O
and O
the O
brilliant O
sun-sparkles O
on O
the O
river O
suggested O
a O
cruel O
glare O
outside O
the O
shady O
veranda O
and O
over-grown O
old O
garden O
. O
A O

A O

on O
a O

A O
large O
table O
with O
a O

, O
at O
her O

had O
at O
one O
end O
a O

with O
the O
remains O
of O
her O
breakfast O
of O
tea O
, O
scones O
and O

. O
The O
end O
nearest O
her O
was O
littered O
with O
sheaves O
of O
manuscript O
, O
newspaper-cuttings O
, O
photographs O
and O
sepia O
sketches O
-- O
obviously O
for O
purposes O
of O

by O

, O
recently O
plucked O
from O
the O

to O

paper-weights O
. O
She O
had O
meant O
to O
be O
very O
busy O
that O
morning O
. O
There O
was O
her O
weekly O
letter O
for O
THE O
IMPERIALIST O
to O
send O
off O
by O
to-morrow O
's O
mail O
, O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
she O
had O
to O
digest O
the O
reasons O
of O
the O
eminent O
journal O
for O
returning O
to O
her O
an O
article O
that O
had O
not O
met O
with O
the O
editor O
's O
approval O
-- O
the O
great O
Gibbs O
: O
a O
potent O
newspaper-factor O
in O
the O
British O
policy O
of O
the O
day O
. O
It O
had O
been O
an O
immense O
honour O
when O
Mr O
Gibbs O
had O
chosen O
Joan O
Gildea O
from O
amongst O
his O
staff O
for O
a O
roving O
commission O
to O
report O
upon O
the O
political O
, O
financial O
, O
economic O
and O
social O
aspects O
of O
Australia O
, O
and O
upon O
Imperial O
interests O
generally O
, O
as O
represented O
in O
various O
sideshows O
on O
her O
route O
. O
But O
it O
happened O
that O
she O
was O
now O
suffering O
from O
a O
change O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
in O
that O
route O
-- O
a O
substitution O
of O
the O
commplace O
P. O
& O
O. O
for O
the O
more O
exciting O
Canadian O
Pacific O
, O
Mr O
Gibbs O
having O
suddenly O
decided O
that O
Imperialism O
in O
Australia O
demanded O
his O
special O
correspondent O
's O
immediate O
attention O
. O
For O
this O
story O
dates O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr O
Joseph O
Chamberlain O
was O
in O
office O
; O
when O
Imperialism O
, O
Free O
Trade O
and O
Yellow O
Labour O
were O
the O
catch O
words O
of O
a O
party O
, O
and O
before O
the O
great O
Australian O
Commonwealth O
had O
become O
an O
historical O
fact O
. O
THE O
IMPERIALIST O
's O
Special O
Correspondent O
looked O
worried O
. O
She O
was O
wondering O
whether O
the O
English O
mail O
expected O
to-day O
would O
bring O
her O
troublesome O
editorial O
instructions O
. O
She O
examined O
some O
of O
the O
photographs O
and O
drawings O
with O
a O
dissatisfied O
air O
. O
A O
running O
inarticulate O
commentary O
might O
have O
been O
put O
into O
words O
like O
this O
: O
' O
No O
good O

I O
can O
manage O
the O
letterpress O
all O
right O

hates O

up O

for O

leg-up O

' O
Mrs O
Gildea O
pulled O
the O
sheet O

been O
typing O
out O
of O
the O

inserted O
another O

Words O
are O
sometimes O
very O
poor O

of O
such O
an O
event O

it O
happens O
now O
and O
then O
, O
on O
the O

that O
a O
plain O

Mrs O
Marjoribanks O
, O
poor O
lady O
, O
had O
been O
an O
invalid O
for O
many O
years O
; O
she O
had O
grown O
a O
little O
peevish O
in O
her O
loneliness O
, O
not O
feeling O
herself O
of O
much O
account O
in O
this O
world O
. O
There O
are O
some O
rare O
natures O
that O
are O
content O
to O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
general O
neglect O
, O
and O
forget O
themselves O
when O
they O
find O
themselves O
forgotten O
; O
but O
it O
is O
unfortunately O
much O
more O
usual O
to O
take O
the O
plan O
adopted O
by O
Mrs O
Marjoribanks O
, O
who O
devoted O
all O
her O
powers O
, O
during O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
of O
her O
life O
, O
to O
the O
solacement O
and O
care O
of O
that O
poor O
self O
which O
other O
people O
neglected O
. O
The O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
when O
she O
disappeared O
from O
her O
sofa O
-- O
except O
for O
the O
mere O
physical O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
there O
-- O
no O
one O
, O
except O
her O
maid O
, O
whose O
occupation O
was O
gone O
, O
could O
have O
found O
out O
much O
difference O
. O
Her O
husband O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
who O
had O
, O
somewhere O
, O
hidden O
deep O
in O
some O
secret O
corner O
of O
his O
physical O
organisation O
, O
the O
remains O
of O
a O
heart O
, O
experienced O
a O
certain O
sentiment O
of O
sadness O
when O
he O
re-entered O
the O
house O
from O
which O
she O
had O
gone O
away O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
Dr O
Marjoribanks O
was O
too O
busy O
a O
man O
to O
waste O
his O
feelings O
on O
a O
mere O
sentiment O
. O
His O
daughter O
, O
however O
, O
was O
only O
fifteen O
, O
and O
had O
floods O
of O
tears O
at O
her O
command O
, O
as O
was O
natural O
at O
that O
age O
. O
All O
the O
way O
home O
she O
revolved O
the O
situation O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
which O
was O
considerably O
enlightened O
by O
novels O
and O
popular O
philosophy O
-- O
for O
the O
lady O
at O
the O
head O
of O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
school O
was O
a O
devoted O
admirer O
of O
_ O
Friends O
in O
Council O
_ O
, O
and O
was O
fond O
of O
bestowing O
that O
work O
as O
a O
prize O
, O
with O
pencil-marks O
on O
the O
margin O
-- O
so O
that O
Lucilla O
's O
mind O
had O
been O
cultivated O
, O
and O
was O
brimful O
of O
the O
best O
of O
sentiments O
. O
She O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
on O
her O
journey O
to O
a O
great O
many O
virtuous O
resolutions O
; O
for O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
as O
hers O
, O
it O
was O
evidently O
the O
duty O
of O
an O
only O
child O
to O
devote O
herself O
to O
her O
father O
's O
comfort O
, O
and O
become O
the O
sunshine O
of O
his O
life O
, O
as O
so O
many O
young O
persons O
of O
her O
age O
have O
been O
known O
to O
become O
in O
literature O
. O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
had O
a O
lively O
mind O
, O
and O
was O
capable O
of O
grasping O
all O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
situation O
at O
a O
glance O
. O
Thus O
, O
between O
the O
outbreaks O
of O
her O
tears O
for O
her O
mother O
, O
it O
became O
apparent O
to O
her O
that O
she O
must O
sacrifice O
her O
own O
feelings O
, O
and O
make O
a O
cheerful O
home O
for O
papa O
, O
and O
that O
a O
great O
many O
changes O
would O
be O
necessary O
in O
the O
household O
-- O
changes O
which O
went O
so O
far O
as O
even O
to O
extend O
to O
the O
furniture O
. O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
sketched O
to O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
lay O
back O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
railway O
carriage O
, O
with O
her O
veil O
down O
, O
how O
she O
would O
wind O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
duty O
of O
presiding O
at O
her O
papa O
's O
dinner-parties O
, O
and O
charming O
everybody O
by O
her O
good O
humour O
, O
and O
brightness O
, O
and O
devotion O
to O
his O
comfort O
; O
and O
how O
, O
when O
it O
was O
all O
over O
, O
she O
would O
withdraw O
and O
cry O
her O
eyes O
out O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
and O
be O
found O
in O
the O
morning O
languid O
and O
worn-out O
, O
but O
always O
heroical O
, O
ready O
to O
go O
downstairs O
and O
assist O
at O
dear O
papa O
's O
breakfast O
, O
and O
keep O
up O
her O
smiles O
for O
him O
till O
he O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
his O
patients O
. O
Altogether O
the O
picture O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
one O
; O
and O
, O
considering O
that O
a O
great O
many O
young O
ladies O
in O
deep O
mourning O
put O
force O
upon O
their O
feelings O
in O
novels O
, O
and O
maintain O
a O
smile O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
unobservant O
male O
creatures O
of O
whom O
they O
have O
the O
charge O
, O
the O
idea O
was O
not O
at O
all O
extravagant O
, O
considering O
that O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
was O
but O
fifteen O
. O
She O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
exactly O
the O
kind O
of O
figure O
for O
this O
_ O
mise O
en O
scène O
_ O
. O
When O
her O
schoolfellows O
talked O
of O
her O
to O
their O
friends O
-- O
for O
Lucilla O
was O
already O
an O
important O
personage O
at O
Mount O
Pleasant O
-- O
the O
most O
common O
description O
they O
gave O
her O
was O
, O
that O
she O
was O
" O
a O
large O
girl O
" O
; O
and O
there O
was O
great O
truth O
in O
the O
adjective O
. O
She O
was O
not O
to O
be O
described O
as O
a O
tall O
girl O
-- O
which O
conveys O
an O
altogether O
different O
idea O
-- O
but O
she O
was O
large O
in O
all O
particulars O
, O
full O
and O
well-developed O
, O
with O
somewhat O
large O
features O
, O
not O
at O
all O
pretty O
as O
yet O
, O
though O
it O
was O
known O
in O
Mount O
Pleasant O
that O
somebody O
had O
said O
that O
such O
a O
face O
might O
ripen O
into O
beauty O
, O
and O
become O
" O
grandiose O
, O
" O
for O
anything O
anybody O
could O
tell O
. O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
was O
not O
vain O
; O
but O
the O
word O
had O
taken O
possession O
of O
her O
imagination O
, O
as O
was O
natural O
, O
and O
solaced O
her O
much O
when O
she O
made O
the O
painful O
discovery O
that O
her O
gloves O
were O
half O
a O
number O
larger O
, O
and O
her O
shoes O
a O
hair-breadth O
broader O
, O
than O
those O
of O
any O
of O
her O
companions O
; O
but O
the O
hands O
and O
feet O
were O
both O
perfectly O
well O
shaped O
; O
and O
being O
at O
the O
same O
time O
well O
clothed O
and O
plump O
, O
were O
much O
more O
presentable O
and O
pleasant O
to O
look O
upon O
than O
the O
lean O
rudimentary O
schoolgirl O
hands O
with O
which O
they O
were O
surrounded O
. O
To O
add O
to O
these O
excellences O
, O
Lucilla O
had O
a O
mass O
of O
hair O
which O
, O
if O
it O
could O
but O
have O
been O
cleared O
a O
little O
in O
its O
tint O
, O
would O
have O
been O
golden O
, O
though O
at O
present O
it O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
tawny O
, O
and O
curly O
to O
exasperation O
. O
She O
wore O
it O
in O
large O
thick O
curls O
, O
which O
did O
not O
, O
however O
, O
float O
or O
wave O
, O
or O
do O
any O
of O
the O
graceful O
things O
which O
curls O
ought O
to O
do O
; O
for O
it O
had O
this O
aggravating O
quality O
, O
that O
it O
would O
not O
grow O
long O
, O
but O
would O
grow O
ridiculously O
, O
unmanageably O
thick O
, O
to O
the O
admiration O
of O
her O
companions O
, O
but O
to O
her O
own O
despair O
, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
knowing O
what O
to O
do O
with O
those O
short O
but O
ponderous O
locks O
. O
These O
were O
the O
external O
characteristics O
of O
the O
girl O
who O
was O
going O
home O
to O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
her O
widowed O
father O
, O
and O
meant O
to O
sacrifice O
herself O
to O
his O
happiness O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
her O
rapid O
journey O
she O
had O
already O
settled O
upon O
everything O
that O
had O
to O
be O
done O
; O
or O
rather O
, O
to O
speak O
truly O
, O
had O
rehearsed O
everything O
, O
according O
to O
the O
habit O
already O
acquired O
by O
a O
quick O
mind O
, O
a O
good O
deal O
occupied O
with O
itself O
. O
First O
, O
she O
meant O
to O
fall O
into O
her O
father O
's O
arms O
-- O
forgetting O
, O
with O
that O
singular O
facility O
for O
overlooking O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
others O
which O
belongs O
to O
such O
a O
character O
, O
that O
Dr O
Marjoribanks O
was O
very O
little O
given O
to O
embracing O
, O
and O
that O
a O
hasty O
kiss O
on O
her O
forehead O
was O
the O
warmest O
caress O
he O
had O
ever O
given O
his O
daughter O
-- O
and O
then O
to O
rush O
up O
to O
the O
chamber O
of O
death O
and O
weep O
over O
dear O
mamma O
. O
" O
And O
to O
think O
I O
was O
not O
there O
to O
soothe O
her O
last O
moments O
! O
" O
Lucilla O
said O
to O
herself O
, O
with O
a O
sob O
, O
and O
with O
feelings O
sufficiently O
real O
in O
their O
way O
. O
After O
this O
, O
the O
devoted O
daughter O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
come O
downstairs O
again O
, O
pale O
as O
death O
, O
but O
self-controlled O
, O
and O
devote O
herself O
to O
papa O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
if O
great O
emotion O
should O
make O
him O
tearless O
, O
as O
such O
cases O
had O
been O
known O
, O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
would O
steal O
into O
his O
arms O
unawares O
, O
and O
so O
surprise O
him O
into O
weeping O
. O
All O
this O
went O
briskly O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
undeterred O
by O
the O
reflection O
that O
tears O
were O
as O
much O
out O
of O
the O
Doctor O
's O
way O
as O
embraces O
; O
and O
in O
this O
mood O
she O
sped O
swiftly O
along O
in O
the O
inspiration O
of O
her O
first O
sorrow O
, O
as O
she O
imagined O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
to O
suffer O
her O
first O
disappointment O
, O
which O
was O
of O
a O
less O
soothing O
character O
than O
that O
mild O
and O
manageable O
grief O
. O
When O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
reached O
home O
her O
mother O
had O
been O
dead O
for O
twenty-four O
hours O
; O
and O
her O
father O
was O
not O
at O
the O
door O
to O
receive O
her O
as O
she O
had O
expected O
, O
but O
by O
the O
bedside O
of O
a O
patient O
in O
extremity O
, O
who O
could O
not O
consent O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the O
world O
without O
the O
Doctor O
. O
This O
was O
a O
sad O
reversal O
of O
her O
intentions O
, O
but O
Lucilla O
was O
not O
the O
woman O
to O
be O
disconcerted O
. O
She O
carried O
out O
the O
second O
part O
of O
her O
programme O
without O
either O
interference O
or O
sympathy O
, O
except O
from O
Mrs O
Marjoribanks O
's O
maid O
, O
who O
had O
some O
hopes O
from O
the O
moment O
of O
her O
arrival O
. O

from O
you O
all O
, O
miss O

" O
sobbed O
the O
faithful O
attendant O
. O
" O
I O
've O
lost O
the O
best O
missus O
as O
ever O
was O
, O
and O
I O
should O
n't O
mind O
going O
after O
her O
. O
Whenever O
any O
one O
gets O
a O
good O
friend O
in O
this O
world O
, O
they O
're O
the O
first O
to O
be O
took O
away O
, O
" O
said O
the O
weeping O
handmaiden O
, O
who O
naturally O
saw O
her O
own O
loss O
in O
the O
most O
vivid O
light O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Ellis O
, O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
, O
reposing O
her O
sorrow O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
this O
anxious O
attendant O
, O
" O
we O
must O
try O
to O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
poor O
papa O
! O
" O
With O
this O
end O
Lucilla O
made O
herself O
very O
troublesome O
to O
the O
sober-minded O
Doctor O
during O
those O
few O
dim O
days O
before O
the O
faint O
and O
daily O
lessening O
shadow O
of O
poor O
Mrs O
Marjoribanks O
was O
removed O
altogether O
from O
the O
house O
. O
When O
that O
sad O
ceremony O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
the O
Doctor O
returned O
, O
serious O
enough O
, O
Heaven O
knows O
, O
to O
the O
great O
house O
, O
where O
the O
faded O
helpless O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
notwithstanding O
been O
his O
love O
and O
his O
bride O
in O
other O
days O
, O
lay O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
familiar O
sofa O
, O
the O
crisis O
arrived O
which O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
had O
rehearsed O
so O
often O
, O
but O
after O
quite O
a O
different O
fashion O
. O
The O
widower O
was O
tearless O
, O
indeed O
, O
but O
not O
from O
excess O
of O
emotion O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
a O
painful O
heaviness O
possessed O
him O
when O
he O
became O
aware O
how O
little O
real O
sorrow O
was O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
how O
small O
an O
actual O
loss O
was O
this O
loss O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
which O
bulked O
before O
the O
world O
as O
an O
event O
of O
just O
as O
much O
magnitude O
as O
the O
loss O
, O
for O
example O
, O
which O
poor O
Mr O
Lake O
, O
the O
drawing-master O
, O
was O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
suffering O
. O
It O
was O
even O
sad O
, O
in O
another O
point O
of O
view O
, O
to O
think O
of O
a O
human O
creature O
passing O
out O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
leaving O
so O
little O
trace O
that O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
there O
. O
As O
for O
the O
pretty O
creature O
whom O
Dr O
Marjoribanks O
had O
married O
, O
she O
had O
vanished O
into O
thin O
air O
years O
and O
years O
ago O
. O
These O
thoughts O
were O
heavy O
enough O
-- O
perhaps O
even O
more O
overwhelming O
than O
that O
grief O
which O
develops O
love O
to O
its O
highest O
point O
of O
intensity O
. O
But O
such O
were O
not O
precisely O
the O
kind O
of O
reflections O
which O
could O
be O
solaced O
by O
paternal O
_ O
attendrissement O
_ O
over O
a O
weeping O
and O
devoted O
daughter O
. O
It O
was O
May O
, O
and O
the O
weather O
was O
warm O
for O
the O
season O
; O
but O
Lucilla O
had O
caused O
the O
fire O
to O
be O
lighted O
in O
the O
large O
gloomy O
library O
where O
Dr O
Marjoribanks O
always O
sat O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
would O
be O
" O
a O
comfort O
" O
to O
him O
; O
and O
, O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
, O
she O
had O
ordered O
tea O
to O
be O
served O
there O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
dinner O
, O
for O
which O
her O
father O
, O
as O
she O
imagined O
, O
could O
have O
little O
appetite O
. O
When O
the O
Doctor O
went O
in O
to O
his O
favourite O
seclusion O
, O
tired O
and O
heated O
and O
sad O
-- O
for O
even O
on O
the O
day O
of O
his O
wife O
's O
funeral O
the O
favourite O
doctor O
of O
Carlingford O
had O
patients O
to O
think O
of O
-- O
the O
very O
heaviness O
of O
his O
thoughts O
gave O
warmth O
to O
his O
indignation O
. O
He O
had O
longed O
for O
the O
quiet O
and O
the O
coolness O
and O
the O
solitude O
of O
his O
library O
, O
apart O
from O
everybody O
; O
and O
when O
he O
found O
it O
radiant O
with O
firelight O
, O
tea O
set O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
Lucilla O
crying O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
in O
her O
new O
crape O
, O
the O
effect O
upon O
a O
temper O
by O
no O
means O
perfect O
may O
be O
imagined O
. O
The O
unfortunate O
man O
threw O
both O
the O
windows O
wide O
open O
and O
rang O
the O
bell O
violently O
, O
and O
gave O
instant O
orders O
for O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
unnecessary O
fire O
and O
the O
tea-service O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
know O
when O
dinner O
is O
ready O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
like O
thunder O
; O
" O
and O
if O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
wants O
a O
fire O
, O
let O
it O
be O
lighted O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
. O
" O
Lucilla O
was O
so O
much O
taken O
by O
surprise O
by O
this O
sudden O
overthrow O
of O
her O
programme O
, O
that O
she O
submitted O
, O
as O
a O
girl O
of O
much O
less O
spirit O
might O
have O
done O
, O
and O
suffered O
herself O
and O
her O
fire O
and O
her O
tea-things O
to O
be O
dismissed O
upstairs O
, O
where O
she O
wept O
still O
more O
at O
sight O
of O
dear O
mamma O
's O
sofa O
, O
and O
where O
Ellis O
came O
to O
mingle O
her O
tears O
with O
those O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
, O
and O
to O
beg O
dear O
Miss O
Lucilla O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
her O
precious O
' O
elth O
and O
her O
dear O
papa O
, O
to O
be O
persuaded O
to O
take O
some O
tea O
. O
On O
the O
whole O
, O
master O
stood O
lessened O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
all O
the O
household O
by O
his O
ability O
to O
eat O
his O
dinner O
, O
and O
his O
resentment O
at O
having O
his O
habitudes O
disturbed O
. O
" O
Them O
men O
would O
eat O
and O
drink O
if O
we O
was O
all O
in O
our O
graves O
, O
" O
said O
the O
indignant O
cook O
, O
who O
indeed O
had O
a O
real O
grievance O
; O
and O
the O
outraged O
sentiment O
of O
the O
kitchen O
was O
avenged O
by O
a O
bad O
and O
hasty O
dinner O
, O
which O
the O
Doctor O
, O
though O
generally O
" O
very O
particular O
, O
" O
swallowed O
without O
remark O
. O
About O
an O
hour O
afterwards O
he O
went O
upstairs O
to O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
where O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
, O
much O
less O
at O
ease O
than O
she O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
. O
Though O
he O
gave O
a O
little O
sigh O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
wife O
's O
sofa O
, O
he O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
sit O
down O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
even O
to O
draw O
it O
a O
little O
out O
of O
its O
position O
, O
which O
, O
as O
Lucilla O
described O
afterwards O
, O
was O
like O
a O
knife O
going O
into O
her O
heart O
. O
Though O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
had O
herself O
decided O
already O
, O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
her O
tears O
, O
that O
the O
drawing-room O
furniture O
had O
got O
very O
faded O
and O
shabby O
, O
and O
that O
it O
would O
be O
very O
expedient O
to O
have O
it O
renewed O
for O
the O
new O
reign O
of O
youth O
and O
energy O
which O
was O
about O
to O
commence O
. O
As O
for O
the O
Doctor O
, O
though O
Miss O
Marjoribanks O
thought O
him O
insensible O
, O
his O
heart O
was O
heavy O
enough O
. O
His O
wife O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
the O
world O
without O
leaving O
the O
least O
mark O
of O
her O
existence O
, O
except O
in O
that O
large O
girl O
, O
whose O
spirits O
and O
forces O
were O
unbounded O
, O
but O
whose O
discretion O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
did O
not O
seem O
much O
greater O
than O
her O
mother O
's O
. O
Instead O
of O
thinking O
of O
her O
as O
a O
comfort O
, O
the O
Doctor O
felt O
himself O
called O
upon O
to O
face O
a O
new O
and O
unexpected O
embarrassment O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
him O
just O
then O
to O
have O
been O
left O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
permitted O
to O
work O
on O
quietly O
at O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
to O
write O
his O
papers O
for O
the O
_ O
Lancet O
_ O
, O
and O
to O
see O
his O
friends O
now O
and O
then O
when O
he O
chose O
; O
for O
Dr O
Marjoribanks O
was O
not O
a O
man O
who O
had O
any O
great O
need O
of O
sympathy O
by O
nature O
, O
or O
who O
was O
at O
all O
addicted O
to O
demonstrations O
of O
feeling O
; O
consequently O
, O
he O
drew O
his O
wife O
's O
sofa O
a O
little O
farther O
from O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
took O
his O
seat O
on O
it O
soberly O
, O
quite O
unaware O
that O
, O
by O
so O
doing O
, O
he O
was O
putting O
a O
knife O
into O
his O
daughter O
's O
heart O

but O
which O
is O
more O
generally O

properly O
known O
by O
the O
name O

This O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
I O
do O
not O
vouch O
for O
the O
fact O
, O
but O
merely O
advert O
to O
it O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
being O
precise O
and O
authentic O
. O
Not O
far O
from O
this O
village O
, O
perhaps O
about O
two O
miles O
, O
there O
is O
a O
little O
valley O
or O
rather O
lap O
of O
land O
among O
high O
hills O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
quietest O
places O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
. O
A O
small O
brook O
glides O
through O
it O
, O
with O
just O
murmur O
enough O
to O
lull O
one O
to O
repose O
; O
and O
the O
occasional O
whistle O
of O
a O
quail O
or O
tapping O
of O
a O
woodpecker O
is O
almost O
the O
only O
sound O
that O
ever O
breaks O
in O
upon O
the O
uniform O
tranquillity O
. O
I O
recollect O
that O
, O
when O
a O
stripling O
, O
my O
first O
exploit O
in O
squirrel-shooting O
was O
in O
a O
grove O
of O
tall O
walnut-trees O
that O
shades O
one O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
. O
I O
had O
wandered O
into O
it O
at O
noontime O
, O
when O
all O
nature O
is O
peculiarly O
quiet O
, O
and O
was O
startled O
by O
the O
roar O
of O
my O
own O
gun O
, O
as O
it O
broke O
the O
Sabbath O
stillness O
around O
and O
was O
prolonged O
and O
reverberated O
by O
the O
angry O
echoes O
. O
If O
ever O
I O
should O
wish O
for O
a O
retreat O
whither O
I O
might O
steal O
from O
the O
world O
and O
its O
distractions O
, O
and O
dream O
quietly O
away O
the O
remnant O
of O
a O
troubled O
life O
, O
I O
know O
of O
none O
more O
promising O
than O
this O
little O
valley O
. O
From O
the O
listless O
repose O
of O
the O
place O
, O
and O
the O
peculiar O
character O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
, O
who O
are O
descendants O
from O
the O
original O
Dutch O
settlers O
, O
this O
sequestered O
glen O
has O
long O
been O
known O
by O
the O
name O
of O
SLEEPY O
HOLLOW O
, O
and O
its O
rustic O
lads O
are O
called O
the O
Sleepy O
Hollow O
Boys O
throughout O
all O
the O
neighboring O
country O
. O
A O
drowsy O
, O
dreamy O
influence O
seems O
to O
hang O
over O
the O
land O
, O
and O
to O
pervade O
the O
very O
atmosphere O
. O
Some O
say O
that O
the O
place O
was O
bewitched O
by O
a O
High O
German O
doctor O
, O
during O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
settlement O
; O
others O
, O
that O
an O
old O
Indian O
chief O
, O
the O
prophet O
or O
wizard O
of O
his O
tribe O
, O
held O
his O
powwows O
there O
before O
the O
country O
was O
discovered O
by O
Master O
Hendrick O
Hudson O
. O
Certain O
it O
is O
, O
the O
place O
still O
continues O
under O
the O
sway O
of O
some O
witching O
power O
, O
that O
holds O
a O
spell O
over O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
good O
people O
, O
causing O
them O
to O
walk O
in O
a O
continual O
reverie O
. O
They O
are O
given O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
marvellous O
beliefs O
, O
are O
subject O
to O
trances O
and O
visions O
, O
and O
frequently O
see O
strange O
sights O
, O
and O
hear O
music O
and O
voices O
in O
the O
air O
. O
The O
whole O
neighborhood O
abounds O
with O
local O
tales O
, O
haunted O
spots O
, O
and O
twilight O
superstitions O
; O
stars O
shoot O
and O
meteors O
glare O
oftener O
across O
the O
valley O
than O
in O
any O
other O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
the O
nightmare O
, O
with O
her O
whole O
ninefold O
, O
seems O
to O
make O
it O
the O
favorite O
scene O
of O
her O
gambols O
. O
The O
dominant O
spirit O
, O
however O
, O
that O
haunts O
this O
enchanted O
region O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
commander-in-chief O
of O
all O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
air O
, O
is O
the O
apparition O
of O
a O
figure O
on O
horseback O
, O
without O
a O
head O
. O
It O
is O
said O
by O
some O
to O
be O
the O
ghost O
of O
a O
Hessian O
trooper O
, O
whose O
head O
had O
been O
carried O
away O
by O
a O
cannon-ball O
, O
in O
some O
nameless O
battle O
during O
the O
Revolutionary O
War O
, O
and O
who O
is O
ever O
and O
anon O
seen O
by O
the O
country O
folk O
hurrying O
along O
in O
the O
gloom O
of O
night O
, O
as O
if O
on O
the O
wings O
of O
the O
wind O
. O
His O
haunts O
are O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
valley O
, O
but O
extend O
at O
times O
to O
the O
adjacent O
roads O
, O
and O
especially O
to O
the O
vicinity O
of O
a O
church O
at O
no O
great O
distance O

Indeed O
, O
certain O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
historians O
of O
those O
parts O
, O
who O
have O
been O
careful O
in O
collecting O
and O
collating O
the O
floating O
facts O
concerning O
this O
spectre O
, O
allege O
that O
the O
body O
of O
the O
trooper O

been O
buried O
in O
the O
churchyard O
, O
the O
ghost O
rides O
forth O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
battle O
in O
nightly O
quest O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
that O
the O
rushing O
speed O
with O
which O
he O
sometimes O
passes O
along O
the O
Hollow O
, O
like O
a O
midnight O
blast O
, O
is O
owing O
to O
his O
being O
belated O
, O
and O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
churchyard O
before O
daybreak O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
general O
purport O
of O
this O
legendary O
superstition O
, O
which O
has O
furnished O
materials O
for O
many O
a O
wild O
story O
in O
that O
region O
of O
shadows O
; O
and O
the O
spectre O
is O
known O
at O
all O
the O
country O
firesides O
, O
by O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Headless O
Horseman O
of O
Sleepy O
Hollow O
. O
It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
the O
visionary O
propensity O
I O
have O
mentioned O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
native O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
but O
is O
unconsciously O
imbibed O
by O
every O
one O
who O
resides O
there O
for O
a O
time O
. O
However O
wide O
awake O
they O
may O
have O
been O
before O
they O
entered O
that O
sleepy O
region O
, O
they O
are O
sure O
, O
in O
a O
little O
time O
, O
to O
inhale O
the O
witching O
influence O
of O
the O
air O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
grow O
imaginative O
, O
to O
dream O
dreams O
, O
and O
see O
apparitions O
. O
I O
mention O
this O
peaceful O
spot O
with O
all O
possible O
laud O
, O
for O
it O
is O
in O
such O
little O
retired O
Dutch O
valleys O
, O
found O
here O
and O
there O
embosomed O
in O
the O
great O
State O
of O
New O
York O
, O
that O
population O
, O
manners O
, O
and O
customs O
remain O
fixed O
, O
while O
the O
great O
torrent O
of O
migration O
and O
improvement O
, O
which O
is O
making O
such O
incessant O
changes O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
this O
restless O
country O
, O
sweeps O
by O
them O
unobserved O
. O
They O
are O
like O
those O
little O
nooks O
of O
still O
water O
, O
which O
border O
a O
rapid O
stream O
, O
where O
we O
may O
see O
the O
straw O
and O
bubble O
riding O
quietly O
at O
anchor O
, O
or O
slowly O
revolving O
in O
their O
mimic O
harbor O
, O
undisturbed O
by O
the O
rush O
of O
the O
passing O
current O
. O
Though O
many O
years O
have O
elapsed O
since O
I O
trod O
the O
drowsy O
shades O
of O
Sleepy O
Hollow O
, O
yet O
I O
question O
whether O
I O
should O
not O
still O
find O
the O
same O
trees O
and O
the O
same O
families O
vegetating O
in O
its O
sheltered O
bosom O
. O
In O
this O
by-place O
of O
nature O
there O
abode O
, O
in O
a O
remote O
period O
of O
American O
history O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
some O
thirty O
years O
since O
, O
a O
worthy O
wight O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Ichabod O
Crane O
, O
who O
sojourned O
, O
or O
, O
as O
he O
expressed O
it O
, O
" O
tarried O
, O
" O
in O
Sleepy O
Hollow O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
instructing O
the O
children O
of O
the O
vicinity O
. O
He O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Connecticut O
, O
a O
State O
which O
supplies O
the O
Union O
with O
pioneers O
for O
the O
mind O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
forest O
, O
and O
sends O
forth O
yearly O
its O
legions O
of O
frontier O
woodmen O
and O
country O
schoolmasters O
. O
The O
cognomen O
of O
Crane O
was O
not O
inapplicable O
to O
his O
person O
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
but O
exceedingly O
lank O
, O
with O
narrow O
shoulders O
, O
long O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
hands O
that O
dangled O
a O
mile O
out O
of O
his O
sleeves O
, O
feet O
that O
might O
have O
served O
for O
shovels O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
frame O
most O
loosely O
hung O
together O
. O
His O
head O
was O
small O
, O
and O
flat O
at O
top O
, O
with O
huge O
ears O
, O
large O
green O
glassy O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
long O
snipe O
nose O
, O
so O
that O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
weather-cock O
perched O
upon O
his O
spindle O
neck O
to O
tell O
which O
way O
the O
wind O
blew O
. O
To O
see O
him O
striding O
along O
the O
profile O
of O
a O
hill O
on O
a O
windy O
day O
, O
with O
his O
clothes O
bagging O
and O
fluttering O
about O
him O
, O
one O
might O
have O
mistaken O
him O
for O
the O
genius O
of O
famine O
descending O
upon O
the O
earth O
, O
or O
some O
scarecrow O
eloped O
from O
a O
cornfield O
. O
His O
schoolhouse O
was O
a O
low O
building O
of O
one O
large O
room O
, O
rudely O
constructed O
of O
logs O
; O
the O
windows O
partly O
glazed O
, O
and O
partly O
patched O
with O
leaves O
of O
old O
copybooks O
. O
It O
was O
most O
ingeniously O
secured O
at O
vacant O
hours O
, O
by O
a O
withe O
twisted O
in O
the O
handle O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
stakes O
set O
against O
the O
window O
shutters O
; O
so O
that O
though O
a O
thief O
might O
get O
in O
with O
perfect O
ease O
, O
he O
would O
find O
some O
embarrassment O
in O
getting O
out O
, O
-- O
an O
idea O
most O
probably O
borrowed O
by O
the O
architect O
, O
Yost O
Van O
Houten O
, O
from O
the O
mystery O
of O
an O
eelpot O
. O
The O
schoolhouse O
stood O
in O
a O
rather O
lonely O
but O
pleasant O
situation O
, O
just O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
woody O
hill O
, O
with O
a O
brook O
running O
close O
by O
, O
and O
a O
formidable O
birch-tree O
growing O
at O
one O
end O
of O
it O
. O
From O
hence O
the O
low O
murmur O
of O
his O
pupils O
’ O
voices O
, O
conning O
over O
their O
lessons O
, O
might O
be O
heard O
in O
a O
drowsy O
summer O
’s O
day O
, O
like O
the O
hum O
of O
a O
beehive O
; O
interrupted O
now O
and O
then O
by O
the O
authoritative O
voice O
of O
the O
master O
, O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
menace O
or O
command O
, O
or O
, O
peradventure O
, O
by O
the O
appalling O
sound O
of O
the O
birch O
, O
as O
he O
urged O
some O
tardy O
loiterer O
along O
the O
flowery O
path O
of O
knowledge O
. O
Truth O
to O
say O
, O
he O
was O
a O
conscientious O
man O
, O
and O
ever O
bore O
in O
mind O
the O
golden O
maxim O
, O
" O
Spare O
the O
rod O
and O
spoil O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Ichabod O
Crane O
’s O
scholars O
certainly O
were O
not O
spoiled O
. O
I O
would O
not O
have O
it O
imagined O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
those O
cruel O
potentates O
of O
the O
school O
who O
joy O
in O
the O
smart O
of O
their O
subjects O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
administered O
justice O
with O
discrimination O
rather O
than O
severity O
; O
taking O
the O
burden O
off O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
weak O
, O
and O
laying O
it O
on O
those O
of O
the O
strong O
. O
Your O
mere O
puny O
stripling O
, O
that O
winced O
at O
the O
least O
flourish O
of O
the O
rod O
, O
was O
passed O
by O
with O
indulgence O
; O
but O
the O
claims O
of O
justice O
were O
satisfied O
by O
inflicting O
a O
double O
portion O
on O
some O
little O
tough O
wrong-headed O
, O
broad-skirted O
Dutch O
urchin O
, O
who O
sulked O
and O
swelled O
and O
grew O
dogged O
and O
sullen O
beneath O
the O
birch O
. O
All O
this O
he O
called O
" O
doing O
his O
duty O
by O
their O
parents O
; O
" O
and O
he O
never O
inflicted O
a O
chastisement O
without O
following O
it O
by O
the O
assurance O
, O
so O
consolatory O
to O
the O
smarting O
urchin O
, O
that O
" O
he O
would O
remember O
it O
and O
thank O
him O
for O
it O
the O
longest O
day O
he O
had O
to O
live O
. O
" O
When O
school O
hours O
were O
over O
, O
he O
was O
even O
the O
companion O
and O
playmate O
of O
the O
larger O
boys O
; O
and O
on O
holiday O
afternoons O
would O
convoy O
some O
of O
the O
smaller O
ones O
home O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
have O
pretty O
sisters O
, O
or O
good O
housewives O
for O
mothers O
, O
noted O
for O
the O
comforts O
of O
the O
cupboard O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
behooved O
him O
to O
keep O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
his O
pupils O
. O
The O
revenue O
arising O
from O
his O
school O
was O
small O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
scarcely O
sufficient O
to O
furnish O
him O
with O
daily O
bread O
, O
for O
he O
was O
a O
huge O
feeder O
, O
and O
, O
though O
lank O
, O
had O
the O
dilating O
powers O
of O
an O
anaconda O
; O
but O
to O
help O
out O
his O
maintenance O
, O
he O
was O
, O
according O
to O
country O
custom O
in O
those O
parts O
, O
boarded O
and O
lodged O
at O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
farmers O
whose O
children O
he O
instructed O
. O
With O
these O
he O
lived O
successively O
a O
week O
at O
a O
time O
, O
thus O
going O
the O
rounds O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
with O
all O
his O
worldly O
effects O
tied O
up O
in O
a O
cotton O
handkerchief O
. O
That O
all O
this O
might O
not O
be O
too O
onerous O
on O
the O
purses O
of O
his O
rustic O
patrons O
, O
who O
are O
apt O
to O
consider O
the O
costs O
of O
schooling O
a O
grievous O
burden O
, O
and O
schoolmasters O
as O
mere O
drones O
, O
he O
had O
various O
ways O
of O
rendering O
himself O
both O
useful O
and O
agreeable O
. O
He O
assisted O
the O
farmers O
occasionally O
in O
the O
lighter O
labors O
of O
their O
farms O
, O
helped O
to O
make O
hay O
, O
mended O
the O
fences O
, O
took O
the O
horses O
to O
water O
, O
drove O
the O
cows O
from O
pasture O
, O
and O
cut O
wood O
for O
the O
winter O
fire O
. O
He O
laid O
aside O
, O
too O
, O
all O
the O
dominant O
dignity O
and O
absolute O
sway O
with O
which O
he O
lorded O
it O
in O
his O
little O
empire O
, O
the O
school O
, O
and O
became O
wonderfully O
gentle O
and O
ingratiating O
. O
He O
found O
favor O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
mothers O
by O
petting O
the O
children O
, O
particularly O
the O
youngest O
; O
and O
like O
the O
lion O
bold O
, O
which O
whilom O
so O
magnanimously O
the O
lamb O
did O
hold O
, O
he O
would O
sit O
with O
a O
child O
on O
one O
knee O
, O
and O
rock O
a O
cradle O
with O
his O
foot O
for O
whole O
hours O
together O
. O

They O
were O
older O

uncle O
Charles O
was O
older O
than O
Dante O

Dante O
had O
two O
brushes O
in O
her O
press O

The O
brush O
with O
the O
maroon O

was O
for O
Michael O

the O
brush O

Dante O

The O
wide O

were O
swarming O
with O
boys O

All O
were O
shouting O
and O
the O
prefects O
urged O
them O
on O
with O
strong O
cries O

The O
evening O
air O
was O
pale O

chilly O

after O
every O
charge O

of O
the O
footballers O
the O
greasy O
leather O
orb O
flew O
like O
a O
heavy O
bird O
through O

out O

out O

He O
felt O
his O
body O
small O

weak O
amid O
the O
throng O

his O

were O

give O
a O
fellow O
a O
belt O

One O
day O
a O
fellow O
said O
to O
Cantwell O
: O
-- O
I O
'd O
give O
you O
such O
a O
belt O
in O
a O
second O
. O
Cantwell O
had O
answered O
: O
-- O
Go O
and O
fight O
your O
match O
. O
Give O
Cecil O
Thunder O
a O
belt O
. O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
you O
. O
He O
'd O
give O
you O
a O
toe O
in O
the O
rump O
for O
yourself O
. O
That O
was O
not O
a O
nice O
expression O
. O
His O
mother O
had O
told O
him O
not O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
rough O
boys O
in O
the O
college O
. O
Nice O
mother O
! O
The O
first O
day O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
the O
castle O
when O
she O
had O
said O
goodbye O
she O
had O
put O
up O
her O
veil O
double O
to O
her O
nose O
to O
kiss O
him O
: O
and O
her O
nose O
and O
eyes O
were O
red O
. O
But O
he O
had O
pretended O
not O
to O
see O
that O
she O
was O
going O
to O
cry O
. O
She O
was O
a O
nice O
mother O
but O
she O
was O
not O
so O
nice O
when O
she O
cried O
. O
And O
his O
father O
had O
given O
him O
two O
five-shilling O
pieces O
for O
pocket O
money O
. O
And O
his O
father O
had O
told O
him O
if O
he O
wanted O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
to O
him O
and O
, O
whatever O
he O
did O
, O
never O
to O
peach O
on O
a O
fellow O
. O
Then O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
castle O
the O
rector O
had O
shaken O
hands O
with O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
his O
soutane O
fluttering O
in O
the O
breeze O
, O
and O
the O
car O
had O
driven O
off O
with O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
on O
it O
. O
They O
had O
cried O
to O
him O
from O
the O
car O
, O
waving O
their O
hands O
: O
-- O
Goodbye O
, O
Stephen O
, O
goodbye O
! O
-- O
Goodbye O
, O
Stephen O
, O
goodbye O
! O
He O
was O
caught O
in O
the O
whirl O
of O
a O
scrimmage O
and O
, O
fearful O
of O
the O
flashing O
eyes O
and O
muddy O
boots O
, O
bent O
down O
to O
look O
through O
the O
legs O
. O
The O
fellows O
were O
struggling O
and O
groaning O
and O
their O
legs O
were O
rubbing O
and O
kicking O
and O
stamping O
. O
Then O
Jack O
Lawton O
's O
yellow O
boots O
dodged O
out O
the O
ball O
and O
all O
the O
other O
boots O
and O
legs O
ran O
after O
. O
He O
ran O
after O
them O
a O
little O
way O
and O
then O
stopped O
. O
It O
was O
useless O
to O
run O
on O
. O
Soon O
they O
would O
be O
going O
home O
for O
the O
holidays O
. O
After O
supper O
in O
the O
study O
hall O
he O
would O
change O
the O
number O
pasted O
up O
inside O
his O
desk O
from O
seventy-seven O
to O
seventy-six O
. O
It O
would O
be O
better O
to O
be O
in O
the O
study O
hall O
than O
out O
there O
in O
the O
cold O
. O
The O
sky O
was O
pale O
and O
cold O
but O
there O
were O
lights O
in O
the O
castle O
. O
He O
wondered O
from O
which O
window O
Hamilton O
Rowan O
had O
thrown O
his O
hat O
on O
the O
ha-ha O
and O
had O
there O
been O
flowerbeds O
at O
that O
time O
under O
the O
windows O
. O
One O
day O
when O
he O
had O
been O
called O
to O
the O
castle O
the O
butler O
had O
shown O
him O
the O
marks O
of O
the O
soldiers O
' O
slugs O
in O
the O
wood O
of O
the O
door O
and O
had O
given O
him O
a O
piece O
of O
shortbread O
that O
the O
community O
ate O
. O
It O
was O
nice O
and O
warm O
to O
see O
the O
lights O
in O
the O
castle O
. O
It O
was O
like O
something O
in O
a O
book O
. O
Perhaps O
Leicester O
Abbey O
was O
like O
that O
. O
And O
there O
were O
nice O
sentences O
in O
Doctor O
Cornwell O
's O
Spelling O
Book O
. O
They O
were O
like O
poetry O
but O
they O
were O
only O
sentences O
to O
learn O
the O
spelling O
from O
. O
Wolsey O
died O
in O
Leicester O
Abbey O
Where O
the O
abbots O
buried O
him O
. O
Canker O
is O
a O
disease O
of O
plants O
, O
Cancer O
one O
of O
animals O
. O
It O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
hearthrug O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
leaning O
his O
head O
upon O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
think O
on O
those O
sentences O
. O
He O
shivered O
as O
if O
he O
had O
cold O
slimy O
water O
next O
his O
skin O
. O
That O
was O
mean O
of O
Wells O
to O
shoulder O
him O
into O
the O
square O
ditch O
because O
he O
would O
not O
swop O
his O
little O
snuff O
box O
for O
Wells O
's O
seasoned O
hacking O
chestnut O
, O
the O
conqueror O
of O
forty O
. O
How O
cold O
and O
slimy O
the O
water O
had O
been O
! O
A O
fellow O
had O
once O
seen O
a O
big O
rat O
jump O
into O
the O
scum O
. O
Mother O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
fire O
with O
Dante O
waiting O
for O
Brigid O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
tea O
. O
She O
had O
her O
feet O
on O
the O
fender O
and O
her O
jewelly O
slippers O
were O
so O
hot O
and O
they O
had O
such O
a O
lovely O
warm O
smell O
! O
Dante O
knew O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O
She O
had O
taught O
him O
where O
the O
Mozambique O
Channel O
was O
and O
what O
was O
the O
longest O
river O
in O
America O
and O
what O
was O
the O
name O
of O
the O
highest O
mountain O
in O
the O
moon O
. O
Father O
Arnall O
knew O
more O
than O
Dante O
because O
he O
was O
a O
priest O
but O
both O
his O
father O
and O
uncle O
Charles O
said O
that O
Dante O
was O
a O
clever O
woman O
and O
a O
well-read O
woman O
. O
And O
when O
Dante O
made O
that O
noise O
after O
dinner O
and O
then O
put O
up O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
mouth O
: O
that O
was O
heartburn O
. O
A O
voice O
cried O
far O
out O
on O
the O
playground O
: O
-- O
All O
in O
! O
Then O
other O
voices O
cried O
from O
the O
lower O
and O
third O
lines O
: O
-- O
All O
in O
! O
All O
in O
! O
The O
players O
closed O
around O
, O
flushed O
and O
muddy O
, O
and O
he O
went O
among O
them O
, O
glad O
to O
go O
in O
. O
Rody O
Kickham O
held O
the O
ball O
by O
its O
greasy O
lace O
. O
A O
fellow O
asked O
him O
to O
give O
it O
one O
last O
: O
but O
he O
walked O
on O
without O
even O
answering O
the O
fellow O
. O
Simon O
Moonan O
told O
him O
not O
to O
because O
the O
prefect O
was O
looking O
. O
The O
fellow O
turned O
to O
Simon O
Moonan O
and O
said O
: O
-- O
We O
all O
know O
why O
you O
speak O
. O
You O
are O
McGlade O
's O
suck O
. O
Suck O
was O
a O
queer O
word O
. O
The O
fellow O
called O
Simon O
Moonan O
that O
name O
because O
Simon O
Moonan O
used O
to O
tie O
the O
prefect O
's O
false O
sleeves O
behind O
his O
back O
and O
the O
prefect O
used O
to O
let O
on O
to O
be O
angry O
. O
But O
the O
sound O
was O
ugly O
. O
Once O
he O
had O
washed O
his O
hands O
in O
the O
lavatory O
of O
the O
Wicklow O
Hotel O
and O
his O
father O
pulled O
the O
stopper O
up O
by O
the O
chain O
after O
and O
the O
dirty O
water O
went O
down O
through O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
basin O
. O
And O
when O
it O
had O
all O
gone O
down O
slowly O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
basin O
had O
made O
a O
sound O
like O
that O
: O
suck O
. O
Only O
louder O
. O
To O
remember O
that O
and O
the O
white O
look O
of O
the O
lavatory O
made O
him O
feel O
cold O
and O
then O
hot O
. O
There O
were O
two O
cocks O
that O
you O
turned O
and O
water O
came O
out O
: O
cold O
and O
hot O
. O
He O
felt O
cold O
and O
then O
a O
little O
hot O
: O
and O
he O
could O
see O
the O
names O
printed O
on O
the O
cocks O
. O
That O
was O
a O
very O
queer O
thing O
. O
And O
the O
air O
in O
the O
corridor O
chilled O
him O
too O
. O
It O
was O
queer O
and O
wettish O
. O
But O
soon O
the O
gas O
would O
be O
lit O
and O
in O
burning O
it O
made O
a O
light O
noise O
like O
a O
little O
song O
. O
Always O
the O
same O
: O
and O
when O
the O
fellows O
stopped O
talking O
in O
the O
playroom O
you O
could O
hear O
it O
. O
It O
was O
the O
hour O
for O
sums O
. O
Father O
Arnall O
wrote O
a O
hard O
sum O
on O
the O
board O
and O
then O
said O
: O
-- O
Now O
then O
, O
who O
will O
win O
? O
Go O
ahead O
, O
York O
! O
Go O
ahead O
, O
Lancaster O
! O
Stephen O
tried O
his O
best O
, O
but O
the O
sum O
was O
too O
hard O
and O
he O
felt O
confused O
. O
The O
little O
silk O
badge O
with O
the O
white O
rose O
on O
it O
that O
was O
pinned O
on O
the O
breast O
of O
his O
jacket O
began O
to O
flutter O
. O
He O
was O
no O
good O
at O
sums O
, O
but O
he O
tried O
his O
best O
so O
that O
York O
might O
not O
lose O
. O
Father O
Arnall O
's O
face O
looked O
very O
black O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
in O
a O
wax O
: O
he O
was O
laughing O
. O
Then O
Jack O
Lawton O
cracked O
his O
fingers O
and O
Father O
Arnall O
looked O
at O
his O
copybook O
and O
said O
: O
-- O
Right O
. O
Bravo O
Lancaster O
! O
The O
red O
rose O
wins O
. O
Come O
on O
now O
, O
York O
! O
Forge O
ahead O
! O
Jack O
Lawton O
looked O
over O
from O
his O
side O
. O
The O
little O
silk O
badge O
with O
the O
red O
rose O
on O
it O
looked O
very O
rich O
because O
he O
had O
a O
blue O
sailor O
top O
on O
. O
Stephen O
felt O
his O
own O
face O
red O
too O
, O
thinking O
of O
all O
the O
bets O
about O
who O
would O
get O
first O
place O
in O
elements O
, O
Jack O
Lawton O
or O
he O
. O
Some O
weeks O
Jack O
Lawton O
got O
the O
card O
for O
first O
and O
some O
weeks O
he O
got O
the O
card O
for O
first O
. O
His O
white O
silk O
badge O
fluttered O
and O
fluttered O
as O
he O
worked O
at O
the O
next O
sum O
and O
heard O
Father O
Arnall O
's O
voice O
. O
Then O
all O
his O
eagerness O
passed O
away O
and O
he O
felt O
his O
face O
quite O
cool O
. O
He O
thought O
his O
face O
must O
be O
white O
because O
it O
felt O
so O
cool O
. O
He O
could O
not O
get O
out O
the O
answer O
for O
the O
sum O
but O
it O
did O
not O
matter O
. O
White O
roses O
and O
red O
roses O
: O
those O
were O
beautiful O
colours O
to O
think O
of O
. O
And O
the O
cards O
for O
first O
place O
and O
second O
place O
and O
third O
place O
were O
beautiful O
colours O
too O
: O
pink O
and O
cream O
and O
lavender O
. O
Lavender O
and O
cream O
and O
pink O
roses O
were O
beautiful O
to O
think O
of O
. O
Perhaps O
a O
wild O
rose O
might O
be O
like O
those O
colours O
and O
he O
remembered O
the O
song O
about O
the O
wild O
rose O
blossoms O
on O
the O
little O
green O
place O
. O
But O
you O
could O
not O
have O
a O
green O
rose O
. O
But O
perhaps O
somewhere O
in O
the O
world O
you O
could O
. O

Edith PROP_PER

Margaret PROP_PER

gently O
, O
' O
Edith PROP_PER
! O
' O
But O
, O
as O
Margaret PROP_PER
half O
suspected O
, O
Edith PROP_PER
had O
fallen O
asleep O
. O
She PRON_PER
lay O
curled O
up O
on O
the O
sofa O
in O
the O
back O
drawing-room O
in O
Harley O
Street O
, O
looking O
very O
lovely O
in O
her PRON_PER
white O
muslin O
and O
blue O
ribbons O
. O
If O
Titania PROP_PER
had O
ever O
been O
dressed O
in O
white O
muslin O
and O
blue O
ribbons O
, O
and O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
on O
a O
crimson O
damask O
sofa O
in O
a O
back O
drawing-room O
, O
Edith PROP_PER
might O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
her PRON_PER
. O
Margaret PROP_PER
was O
struck O
afresh O
by O
her NOM_PER
cousin NOM_PER
's O
beauty O
. O
They O
had O
grown O
up O
together O
from O
childhood O
, O
and O
all O
along O
Edith O
had O
been O
remarked O
upon O
by O
every O
one O
, O
except O
Margaret O
, O
for O
her O
prettiness O
; O
but O
Margaret O
had O
never O
thought O
about O
it O
until O
the O
last O
few O
days O
, O
when O
the O
prospect O
of O
soon O
losing O
her O
companion O
seemed O
to O
give O
force O
to O
every O
sweet O
quality O
and O
charm O
which O
Edith O
possessed O
. O
They O
had O
been O
talking O
about O
wedding O
dresses O
, O
and O
wedding O
ceremonies O
; O
and O
Captain O
Lennox O
, O
and O
what O
he O
had O
told O
Edith O
about O
her O
future O
life O
at O
Corfu O
, O
where O
his O
regiment O
was O
stationed O
; O
and O
the O
difficulty O
of O
keeping O
a O
piano O
in O
good O
tune O
( O
a O
difficulty O
which O
Edith O
seemed O
to O
consider O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
formidable O
that O
could O
befall O
her O
in O
her O
married O
life O
) O
, O
and O
what O
gowns O
she O
should O
want O
in O
the O
visits O
to O
Scotland O
, O
which O
would O
immediately O
succeed O
her O
marriage O
; O
but O
the O
whispered O
tone O
had O
latterly O
become O
more O
drowsy O
; O
and O
Margaret O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
of O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
found O
, O
as O
she O
fancied O
, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
buzz O
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
Edith O
had O
rolled O
herself O
up O
into O
a O
soft O
ball O
of O
muslin O
and O
ribbon O
, O
and O
silken O
curls O
, O
and O
gone O
off O
into O
a O
peaceful O
little O
after-dinner O
nap O
. O
Margaret O
had O
been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
telling O
her O
cousin O
of O
some O
of O
the O
plans O
and O
visions O
which O
she O
entertained O
as O
to O
her O
future O
life O
in O
the O
country O
parsonage O
, O
where O
her O
father O
and O
mother O
lived O
; O
and O
where O
her O
bright O
holidays O
had O
always O
been O
passed O
, O
though O
for O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
her O
aunt O
Shaw O
's O
house O
had O
been O
considered O
as O
her O
home O
. O
But O
in O
default O
of O
a O
listener O
, O
she O
had O
to O
brood O
over O
the O
change O
in O
her O
life O
silently O
as O
heretofore O
. O
It O
was O
a O
happy O
brooding O
, O
although O
tinged O
with O
regret O
at O
being O
separated O
for O
an O
indefinite O
time O
from O
her O
gentle O
aunt O
and O
dear O
cousin O
. O
As O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
delight O
of O
filling O
the O
important O
post O
of O
only O
daughter O
in O
Helstone O
parsonage O
, O
pieces O
of O
the O
conversation O
out O
of O
the O
next O
room O
came O
upon O
her O
ears O
. O
Her O
aunt O
Shaw O
was O
talking O
to O
the O
five O
or O
six O
ladies O
who O
had O
been O
dining O
there O
, O
and O
whose O
husbands O
were O
still O
in O
the O
dining-room O
. O
They O
were O
the O
familiar O
acquaintances O
of O
the O
house O
; O
neighbours O
whom O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
called O
friends O
, O
because O
she O
happened O
to O
dine O
with O
them O
more O
frequently O
than O
with O
any O
other O
people O
, O
and O
because O
if O
she O
or O
Edith O
wanted O
anything O
from O
them O
, O
or O
they O
from O
her O
, O
they O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
make O
a O
call O
at O
each O
other O
's O
houses O
before O
luncheon O
. O
These O
ladies O
and O
their O
husbands O
were O
invited O
, O
in O
their O
capacity O
of O
friends O
, O
to O
eat O
a O
farewell O
dinner O
in O
honour O
of O
Edith O
's O
approaching O
marriage O
. O
Edith O
had O
rather O
objected O
to O
this O
arrangement O
, O
for O
Captain O
Lennox O
was O
expected O
to O
arrive O
by O
a O
late O
train O
this O
very O
evening O
; O
but O
, O
although O
she O
was O
a O
spoiled O
child O
, O
she O
was O
too O
careless O
and O
idle O
to O
have O
a O
very O
strong O
will O
of O
her O
own O
, O
and O
gave O
way O
when O
she O
found O
that O
her O
mother O
had O
absolutely O
ordered O
those O
extra O
delicacies O
of O
the O
season O
which O
are O
always O
supposed O
to O
be O
efficacious O
against O
immoderate O
grief O
at O
farewell O
dinners O
. O
She O
contented O
herself O
by O
leaning O
back O
in O
her O
chair O
, O
merely O
playing O
with O
the O
food O
on O
her O
plate O
, O
and O
looking O
grave O
and O
absent O
; O
while O
all O
around O
her O
were O
enjoying O
the O
mots O
of O
Mr. O
Grey O
, O
the O
gentleman O
who O
always O
took O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table O
at O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
's O
dinner O
parties O
, O
and O
asked O
Edith O
to O
give O
them O
some O
music O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
. O
Mr. O
Grey O
was O
particularly O
agreeable O
over O
this O
farewell O
dinner O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
staid O
down O
stairs O
longer O
than O
usual O
. O
It O
was O
very O
well O
they O
did O
-- O
to O
judge O
from O
the O
fragments O
of O
conversation O
which O
Margaret O
overheard O
. O
' O
I O
suffered O
too O
much O
myself O
; O
not O
that O
I O
was O
not O
extremely O
happy O
with O
the O
poor O
dear O
General O
, O
but O
still O
disparity O
of O
age O
is O
a O
drawback O
; O
one O
that O
I O
was O
resolved O
Edith O
should O
not O
have O
to O
encounter O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
without O
any O
maternal O
partiality O
, O
I O
foresaw O
that O
the O
dear O
child O
was O
likely O
to O
marry O
early O
; O
indeed O
, O
I O
had O
often O
said O
that O
I O
was O
sure O
she O
would O
be O
married O
before O
she O
was O
nineteen O
. O
I O
had O
quite O
a O
prophetic O
feeling O
when O
Captain O
Lennox O
' O
-- O
and O
here O
the O
voice O
dropped O
into O
a O
whisper O
, O
but O
Margaret O
could O
easily O
supply O
the O
blank O
. O
The O
course O
of O
true O
love O
in O
Edith O
's O
case O
had O
run O
remarkably O
smooth O
. O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
had O
given O
way O
to O
the O
presentiment O
, O
as O
she O
expressed O
it O
; O
and O
had O
rather O
urged O
on O
the O
marriage O
, O
although O
it O
was O
below O
the O
expectations O
which O
many O
of O
Edith O
's O
acquaintances O
had O
formed O
for O
her O
, O
a O
young O
and O
pretty O
heiress O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
said O
that O
her O
only O
child O
should O
marry O
for O
love O
, O
-- O
and O
sighed O
emphatically O
, O
as O
if O
love O
had O
not O
been O
her O
motive O
for O
marrying O
the O
General O
. O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
enjoyed O
the O
romance O
of O
the O
present O
engagement O
rather O
more O
than O
her O
daughter O
. O
Not O
but O
that O
Edith O
was O
very O
thoroughly O
and O
properly O
in O
love O
; O
still O
she O
would O
certainly O
have O
preferred O
a O
good O
house O
in O
Belgravia O
, O
to O
all O
the O
picturesqueness O
of O
the O
life O
which O
Captain O
Lennox O
described O
at O
Corfu O
. O
The O
very O
parts O
which O
made O
Margaret O
glow O
as O
she O
listened O
, O
Edith O
pretended O
to O
shiver O
and O
shudder O
at O
; O
partly O
for O
the O
pleasure O
she O
had O
in O
being O
coaxed O
out O
of O
her O
dislike O
by O
her O
fond O
lover O
, O
and O
partly O
because O
anything O
of O
a O
gipsy O
or O
make-shift O
life O
was O
really O
distasteful O
to O
her O
. O
Yet O
had O
any O
one O
come O
with O
a O
fine O
house O
, O
and O
a O
fine O
estate O
, O
and O
a O
fine O
title O
to O
boot O
, O
Edith O
would O
still O
have O
clung O
to O
Captain O
Lennox O
while O
the O
temptation O
lasted O
; O
when O
it O
was O
over O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
she O
might O
have O
had O
little O
qualms O
of O
ill-concealed O
regret O
that O
Captain O
Lennox O
could O
not O
have O
united O
in O
his O
person O
everything O
that O
was O
desirable O
. O
In O
this O
she O
was O
but O
her O
mother O
's O
child O
; O
who O
, O
after O
deliberately O
marrying O
General O
Shaw O
with O
no O
warmer O
feeling O
than O
respect O
for O
his O
character O
and O
establishment O
, O
was O
constantly O
, O
though O
quietly O
, O
bemoaning O
her O
hard O
lot O
in O
being O
united O
to O
one O
whom O
she O
could O
not O
love O
. O
' O
I O
have O
spared O
no O
expense O
in O
her O
trousseau O
, O
' O
were O
the O
next O
words O
Margaret O
heard O
. O
' O
She O
has O
all O
the O
beautiful O
Indian O
shawls O
and O
scarfs O
the O
General O
gave O
to O
me O
, O
but O
which O
I O
shall O
never O
wear O
again O
. O
' O
' O
She O
is O
a O
lucky O
girl O
, O
' O
replied O
another O
voice O
, O
which O
Margaret O
knew O
to O
be O
that O
of O
Mrs. O
Gibson O
, O
a O
lady O
who O
was O
taking O
a O
double O
interest O
in O
the O
conversation O
, O
from O
the O
fact O
of O
one O
of O
her O
daughters O
having O
been O
married O
within O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
. O
' O
Helen O
had O
set O
her O
heart O
upon O
an O
Indian O
shawl O
, O
but O
really O
when O
I O
found O
what O
an O
extravagant O
price O
was O
asked O
, O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
refuse O
her O
. O
She O
will O
be O
quite O
envious O
when O
she O
hears O
of O
Edith O
having O
Indian O
shawls O
. O
What O
kind O
are O
they O
? O
Delhi O
? O
with O
the O
lovely O
little O
borders O
? O
' O
Margaret O
heard O
her O
aunt O
's O
voice O
again O
, O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
as O
if O
she O
had O
raised O
herself O
up O
from O
her O
half-recumbent O
position O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
into O
the O
more O
dimly O
lighted O
back O
drawing-room O
. O
' O
Edith O
! O
Edith O
! O
' O
cried O
she O
; O
and O
then O
she O
sank O
as O
if O
wearied O
by O
the O
exertion O
. O
Margaret O
stepped O
forward O
. O
' O
Edith O
is O
asleep O
, O
Aunt O
Shaw O
. O
Is O
it O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
? O
' O
All O
the O
ladies O
said O
' O
Poor O
child O
! O
' O
on O
receiving O
this O
distressing O
intelligence O
about O
Edith O
; O
and O
the O
minute O
lap-dog O
in O
Mrs. O
Shaw O
's O
arms O
began O
to O
bark O
, O
as O
if O
excited O
by O
the O
burst O
of O
pity O
. O
' O
Hush O
, O
Tiny O
! O
you O
naughty O
little O
girl O
! O
you O
will O
waken O
your O
mistress O
. O
It O
was O
only O
to O
ask O
Edith O
if O
she O
would O
tell O
Newton O
to O
bring O
down O
her O
shawls O
: O
perhaps O
you O
would O
go O
, O
Margaret O
dear O
? O
' O
Margaret O
went O
up O
into O
the O
old O
nursery O
at O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
house O
, O
where O
Newton O
was O
busy O
getting O
up O
some O
laces O
which O
were O
required O
for O
the O
wedding O
. O
While O
Newton O
went O
( O
not O
without O
a O
muttered O
grumbling O
) O
to O
undo O
the O
shawls O
, O
which O
had O
already O
been O
exhibited O
four O
or O
five O
times O
that O
day O
, O
Margaret O
looked O
round O
upon O
the O
nursery O
; O
the O
first O
room O
in O
that O
house O
with O
which O
she O
had O
become O
familiar O
nine O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
she O
was O
brought O
, O
all O
untamed O
from O
the O
forest O
, O
to O
share O
the O
home O
, O
the O
play O
, O
and O
the O
lessons O
of O
her O
cousin O
Edith O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
dark O
, O
dim O
look O
of O
the O
London O
nursery O
, O
presided O
over O
by O
an O
austere O
and O
ceremonious O
nurse O
, O
who O
was O
terribly O
particular O
about O
clean O
hands O
and O
torn O
frocks O
. O
She O
recollected O
the O
first O
tea O
up O
there O
-- O
separate O
from O
her O
father O
and O
aunt O
, O
who O
were O
dining O
somewhere O
down O
below O
an O
infinite O
depth O
of O
stairs O
; O
for O
unless O
she O
were O
up O
in O
the O
sky O
( O
the O
child O
thought O
) O
, O
they O
must O
be O
deep O
down O
in O
the O
bowels O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
At O
home O
-- O
before O
she O
came O
to O
live O
in O
Harley O
Street O
-- O
her O
mother O
's O
dressing-room O
had O
been O
her O
nursery O
; O
and O
, O
as O
they O
kept O
early O
hours O
in O
the O
country O
parsonage O
, O
Margaret O
had O
always O
had O
her O
meals O
with O
her O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
Oh O
! O
well O
did O
the O
tall O
stately O
girl O
of O
eighteen O
remember O
the O
tears O
shed O
with O
such O
wild O
passion O
of O
grief O
by O
the O
little O
girl O
of O
nine O
, O
as O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
under O
the O
bed-clothes O
, O
in O
that O
first O
night O
; O
and O
how O
she O
was O
bidden O
not O
to O
cry O
by O
the O
nurse O
, O
because O
it O
would O
disturb O
Miss O
Edith O
; O
and O
how O
she O
had O
cried O
as O
bitterly O
, O
but O
more O
quietly O
, O
till O
her O
newly-seen O
, O
grand O
, O
pretty O
aunt O
had O
come O
softly O
upstairs O
with O
Mr. O
Hale O
to O
show O
him O
his O
little O
sleeping O
daughter O
. O
Then O
the O
little O
Margaret O
had O
hushed O
her O
sobs O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
lie O
quiet O
as O
if O
asleep O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
making O
her O
father O
unhappy O
by O
her O
grief O
, O
which O
she O
dared O
not O
express O
before O
her O
aunt O
, O
and O
which O
she O
rather O
thought O
it O
was O
wrong O
to O
feel O
at O
all O
after O
the O
long O
hoping O
, O
and O
planning O
, O
and O
contriving O
they O
had O
gone O
through O
at O
home O
, O
before O
her O
wardrobe O
could O
be O
arranged O
so O
as O
to O
suit O
her O
grander O
circumstances O
, O
and O
before O
papa O
could O
leave O
his O
parish O
to O
come O
up O
to O
London O
, O
even O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
Now O
she O
had O
got O
to O
love O
the O
old O
nursery O
, O
though O
it O
was O
but O
a O
dismantled O
place O
; O
and O
she O
looked O
all O
round O
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
cat-like O
regret O
, O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
it O
for O
ever O
in O
three O
days O
. O
' O
Ah O
Newton O
! O
' O
said O
she O
, O
' O
I O
think O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
sorry O
to O
leave O
this O
dear O
old O
room O
. O

Stately O
, O
plump O
Buck O
Mulligan O
came O
from O
the O
stairhead O
, O
bearing O
a O
bowl O
of O
lather O
on O
which O
a O
mirror O
and O
a O
razor O
lay O
crossed O
. O
A O
yellow O
dressinggown O
, O
ungirdled O
, O
was O
sustained O
gently O
behind O
him O
on O
the O
mild O
morning O
air O
. O
He O
held O
the O
bowl O
aloft O
and O
intoned O
: O
— O
Introibo O
ad O
altare O
Dei O
. O
Halted O
, O
he O
peered O
down O
the O
dark O
winding O
stairs O
and O
called O
out O
coarsely O
: O
— O
Come O
up O
, O
Kinch O
! O
Come O
up O
, O
you O
fearful O
jesuit O
! O
Solemnly O
he O
came O
forward O
and O
mounted O
the O
round O
gunrest O
. O
He O
faced O
about O
and O
blessed O
gravely O
thrice O
the O
tower O
, O
the O
surrounding O
land O
and O
the O
awaking O
mountains O
. O
Then O
, O
catching O
sight O
of O
Stephen O
Dedalus O
, O
he O
bent O
towards O
him O
and O
made O
rapid O
crosses O
in O
the O
air O
, O
gurgling O
in O
his O
throat O
and O
shaking O
his O
head O
. O
Stephen O
Dedalus O
, O
displeased O
and O
sleepy O
, O
leaned O
his O
arms O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
staircase O
and O
looked O
coldly O
at O
the O
shaking O
gurgling O
face O
that O
blessed O
him O
, O
equine O
in O
its O
length O
, O
and O
at O
the O
light O
untonsured O
hair O
, O
grained O
and O
hued O
like O
pale O
oak O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
peeped O
an O
instant O
under O
the O
mirror O
and O
then O
covered O
the O
bowl O
smartly O
. O
— O
Back O
to O
barracks O
! O
he O
said O
sternly O
. O
He O
added O
in O
a O
preacher O
’s O
tone O
: O
— O
For O
this O
, O
O O
dearly O
beloved O
, O
is O
the O
genuine O
Christine O
: O
body O
and O
soul O
and O
blood O
and O
ouns O
. O
Slow O
music O
, O
please O
. O
Shut O
your O
eyes O
, O
gents O
. O
One O
moment O
. O
A O
little O
trouble O
about O
those O
white O
corpuscles O
. O
Silence O
, O
all O
. O
He O
peered O
sideways O
up O
and O
gave O
a O
long O
slow O
whistle O
of O
call O
, O
then O
paused O
awhile O
in O
rapt O
attention O
, O
his O
even O
white O
teeth O
glistening O
here O
and O
there O
with O
gold O
points O
. O
Chrysostomos O
. O
Two O
strong O
shrill O
whistles O
answered O
through O
the O
calm O
. O
— O
Thanks O
, O
old O
chap O
, O
he O
cried O
briskly O
. O
That O
will O
do O
nicely O
. O
Switch O
off O
the O
current O
, O
will O
you O
? O
He O
skipped O
off O
the O
gunrest O
and O
looked O
gravely O
at O
his O
watcher O
, O
gathering O
about O
his O
legs O
the O
loose O
folds O
of O
his O
gown O
. O
The O
plump O
shadowed O
face O
and O
sullen O
oval O
jowl O
recalled O
a O
prelate O
, O
patron O
of O
arts O
in O
the O
middle O
ages O
. O
A O
pleasant O
smile O
broke O
quietly O
over O
his O
lips O
. O
— O
The O
mockery O
of O
it O
! O
he O
said O
gaily O
. O
Your O
absurd O
name O
, O
an O
ancient O
Greek O
! O
He O
pointed O
his O
finger O
in O
friendly O
jest O
and O
went O
over O
to O
the O
parapet O
, O
laughing O
to O
himself O
. O
Stephen O
Dedalus O
stepped O
up O
, O
followed O
him O
wearily O
halfway O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
gunrest O
, O
watching O
him O
still O
as O
he O
propped O
his O
mirror O
on O
the O
parapet O
, O
dipped O
the O
brush O
in O
the O
bowl O
and O
lathered O
cheeks O
and O
neck O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
’s O
gay O
voice O
went O
on O
. O
— O
My O
name O
is O
absurd O
too O
: O
Malachi O
Mulligan O
, O
two O
dactyls O
. O
But O
it O
has O
a O
Hellenic O
ring O
, O
has O
n’t O
it O
? O
Tripping O
and O
sunny O
like O
the O
buck O
himself O

We O
must O
go O
to O
Athens O

Will O
you O
come O
if O
I O
can O
get O
the O
aunt O
to O
fork O
out O
twenty O
quid O
? O
He O
laid O
the O
brush O
aside O
and O
, O
laughing O

The O

Ceasing O

he O
began O
to O

Stephen O
said O
quietly O

— O

— O

Buck O

showed O
a O
shaven O
cheek O
over O
his O
right O
shoulder O
. O
— O
God O
, O
is O

he O
dreadful O
? O
he O
said O
frankly O
. O
A O
ponderous O
Saxon O
. O
He O
thinks O
you O
’re O
not O
a O
gentleman O
. O
God O
, O
these O
bloody O
English O
! O
Bursting O
with O
money O
and O

. O
Because O

comes O
from O
Oxford O

You O

the O

He O
ca O

O O
, O
my O
name O
for O
you O
is O
the O
best O
: O
Kinch O
, O
the O
knife-blade O
. O
He O
shaved O
warily O
over O
his O
chin O
. O
— O
He O
was O
raving O
all O
night O
about O
a O
black O
panther O
, O
Stephen O
said O
. O
Where O
is O
his O
guncase O
? O
— O
A O
woful O
lunatic O
! O
Mulligan O
said O
. O
Were O
you O
in O
a O
funk O
? O
— O
I O
was O
, O
Stephen O
said O
with O
energy O
and O
growing O
fear O
. O
Out O
here O
in O
the O
dark O
with O
a O
man O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
raving O
and O
moaning O
to O
himself O
about O
shooting O
a O
black O
panther O
. O
You O
saved O
men O
from O
drowning O
. O
I O
’m O
not O
a O
hero O
, O
however O
. O
If O
he O
stays O
on O
here O
I O
am O
off O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
frowned O
at O
the O
lather O
on O
his O
razorblade O
. O
He O
hopped O
down O
from O
his O
perch O
and O
began O
to O
search O
his O
trouser O
pockets O
hastily O
. O
— O
Scutter O
! O
he O
cried O
thickly O
. O
He O
came O
over O
to O
the O
gunrest O
and O
, O
thrusting O
a O
hand O
into O
Stephen O
’s O
upper O
pocket O
, O
said O
: O
— O
Lend O
us O
a O
loan O
of O
your O
noserag O
to O
wipe O
my O
razor O
. O
Stephen O
suffered O
him O
to O
pull O
out O
and O
hold O
up O
on O
show O
by O
its O
corner O
a O
dirty O
crumpled O
handkerchief O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
wiped O
the O
razorblade O
neatly O
. O
Then O
, O
gazing O
over O
the O
handkerchief O
, O
he O
said O
: O
— O
The O

! O
A O

Irish O

He O
mounted O
to O
the O
parapet O
again O
and O
gazed O
out O
over O
Dublin O
bay O
, O
his O
fair O
oakpale O
hair O
stirring O
slightly O
. O
— O
God O
! O
he O
said O
quietly O
. O
Is O

Come O

Stephen O
stood O
up O
and O
went O
over O
to O
the O
parapet O
. O
Leaning O
on O
it O
he O
looked O
down O
on O
the O
water O
and O
on O
the O
mailboat O
clearing O
the O
harbourmouth O
of O
Kingstown O
. O
— O
Our O
mighty O
mother O
! O
Buck O
Mulligan O
said O
. O
He O
turned O
abruptly O
his O
grey O
searching O
eyes O
from O
the O
sea O
to O
Stephen O
’s O
face O
. O
— O
The O
aunt O
thinks O
you O
killed O
your O
mother O
, O
he O
said O
. O
That O
’s O
why O
she O
wo O
n’t O
let O
me O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
you O
. O
— O
Someone O
killed O
her O
, O
Stephen O
said O
gloomily O
. O
— O
You O
could O
have O
knelt O
down O
, O
damn O
it O
, O
Kinch O
, O
when O
your O
dying O
mother O
asked O
you O
, O
Buck O
Mulligan O
said O
. O
I O
’m O
hyperborean O
as O
much O
as O
you O
. O
But O
to O
think O
of O
your O
mother O
begging O
you O
with O
her O
last O
breath O
to O
kneel O
down O
and O
pray O
for O
her O
. O
And O
you O
refused O
. O
There O
is O
something O
sinister O
in O
you O
... O
. O
He O
broke O
off O
and O
lathered O
again O
lightly O
his O
farther O
cheek O
. O
A O
tolerant O
smile O
curled O
his O
lips O
. O
— O
But O
a O
lovely O
mummer O
! O
he O
murmured O
to O
himself O
. O
Kinch O
, O
the O
loveliest O
mummer O
of O
them O
all O
! O
He O
shaved O
evenly O
and O
with O
care O
, O
in O
silence O
, O
seriously O
. O
Stephen O
, O
an O
elbow O
rested O
on O
the O
jagged O
granite O
, O
leaned O
his O
palm O
against O
his O
brow O
and O
gazed O
at O
the O
fraying O
edge O
of O
his O
shiny O
black O
coat-sleeve O
. O
Pain O
, O
that O
was O
not O
yet O
the O
pain O
of O
love O
, O
fretted O
his O
heart O
. O
Silently O
, O
in O
a O
dream O
she O
had O
come O
to O
him O
after O
her O
death O
, O
her O
wasted O
body O
within O
its O
loose O
brown O
graveclothes O
giving O
off O
an O
odour O
of O
wax O
and O
rosewood O
, O
her O
breath O
, O
that O
had O
bent O
upon O
him O
, O
mute O
, O
reproachful O
, O
a O
faint O
odour O
of O
wetted O
ashes O
. O
Across O
the O
threadbare O
cuffedge O
he O
saw O
the O
sea O
hailed O
as O
a O
great O
sweet O
mother O
by O
the O
wellfed O
voice O
beside O
him O
. O
The O
ring O
of O
bay O
and O
skyline O
held O
a O
dull O
green O
mass O
of O
liquid O
. O
A O
bowl O
of O
white O
china O
had O
stood O
beside O
her O
deathbed O
holding O
the O
green O
sluggish O
bile O
which O
she O
had O
torn O
up O
from O
her O
rotting O
liver O
by O
fits O
of O
loud O
groaning O
vomiting O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
wiped O
again O
his O
razorblade O
. O
— O
Ah O
, O
poor O
dogsbody O
! O
he O
said O
in O
a O
kind O
voice O
. O
I O
must O
give O
you O
a O
shirt O
and O
a O
few O
noserags O
. O
How O
are O
the O
secondhand O
breeks O
? O
— O
They O
fit O
well O
enough O
, O
Stephen O
answered O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
attacked O
the O
hollow O
beneath O
his O
underlip O
. O
— O
The O
mockery O
of O
it O
, O
he O
said O
contentedly O
. O
Secondleg O
they O
should O
be O
. O
God O
knows O
what O
poxy O
bowsy O
left O
them O
off O
. O
I O
have O
a O
lovely O
pair O
with O
a O

grey O
. O
You O
’ll O
look O
spiffing O
in O
them O
. O
I O
’m O
not O

, O
Kinch O
. O
You O
look O
damn O
well O
when O
you O
’re O
dressed O
. O
— O
Thanks O
, O
Stephen O
said O
. O
I O
ca O
n’t O
wear O
them O
if O
they O
are O
grey O
. O
— O
He O
ca O
n’t O
wear O
them O
, O
Buck O
Mulligan O
told O
his O
face O
in O
the O
mirror O
. O
Etiquette O
is O
etiquette O
. O
He O
kills O
his O
mother O
but O
he O
ca O
n’t O
wear O
grey O
trousers O
. O
He O
folded O
his O
razor O
neatly O
and O
with O
stroking O
palps O
of O
fingers O
felt O
the O
smooth O
skin O
. O
Stephen O
turned O
his O
gaze O
from O
the O
sea O
and O
to O
the O
plump O
face O
with O
its O
smokeblue O
mobile O
eyes O
. O
— O
That O
fellow O
I O
was O
with O
in O
the O
Ship O
last O

Buck O
Mulligan O
, O

He O
’s O
up O
in O
Dottyville O
with O
Connolly O
Norman O

General O

of O
the O

! O
He O
swept O
the O
mirror O
a O
half O
circle O
in O
the O
air O
to O
flash O
the O
tidings O
abroad O
in O
sunlight O
now O
radiant O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
His O
curling O
shaven O
lips O
laughed O
and O
the O
edges O
of O
his O
white O
glittering O
teeth O
. O
Laughter O
seized O
all O
his O
strong O
wellknit O
trunk O
. O
— O
Look O
at O
yourself O
, O
he O
said O
, O
you O
dreadful O
bard O
! O
Stephen O
bent O
forward O
and O
peered O
at O
the O
mirror O
held O
out O
to O
him O
, O
cleft O
by O
a O
crooked O
crack O
. O
Hair O
on O

As O
he O

This O

It O
asks O
me O
too O

— O
I O
pinched O
it O
out O
of O
the O

Buck O
Mulligan O
said O

It O
does O
her O
all O
right O

The O
aunt O
always O
keeps O
plainlooking O
servants O
for O
Malachi O

Lead O
him O
not O
into O
temptation O
. O
And O
her O
name O
is O
Ursula O
. O
Laughing O
again O
, O
he O
brought O
the O
mirror O
away O
from O
Stephen O
’s O
peering O
eyes O
. O
— O
The O
rage O
of O
Caliban O
at O
not O
seeing O
his O
face O
in O
a O
mirror O
, O
he O
said O
. O
If O
Wilde O
were O
only O
alive O
to O
see O
you O
! O
Drawing O
back O
and O
pointing O
, O
Stephen O
said O
with O
bitterness O
: O
— O
It O
is O
a O
symbol O
of O
Irish O
art O
. O
The O
cracked O
lookingglass O
of O
a O
servant O
. O
Buck O
Mulligan O
suddenly O
linked O
his O
arm O
in O
Stephen O
’s O
and O
walked O
with O
him O
round O
the O
tower O
, O
his O
razor O
and O
mirror O
clacking O
in O
the O
pocket O
where O
he O
had O
thrust O
them O
. O
— O
It O
’s O
not O
fair O
to O
tease O
you O
like O
that O
, O
Kinch O
, O
is O
it O
? O
he O
said O
kindly O
. O
God O
knows O
you O
have O
more O
spirit O
than O
any O
of O
them O
. O
Parried O
again O
. O
He O
fears O
the O
lancet O
of O
my O

as O
I O
fear O
that O
of O
his O

The O

He O

stinking O
with O

and O
thinks O
you O

. O
His O

his O

God O

when O

about O

friend O
; O
yet O
on O
his O
learning O
that O
Waymarsh O
was O
apparently O
not O
to O
arrive O
till O
evening O
he O
was O
not O
wholly O
disconcerted O
. O
A O
telegram O
from O
him O
bespeaking O
a O
room O
" O
only O
if O
not O
noisy O
, O
" O
reply O
paid O
, O
was O
produced O
for O
the O
enquirer O
at O
the O
office O
, O
so O
that O
the O
understanding O
they O
should O
meet O
at O
Chester O
rather O
than O
at O
Liverpool O
remained O
to O
that O
extent O
sound O
. O
The O
same O
secret O
principle O
, O
however O
, O
that O
had O
prompted O
Strether O
not O
absolutely O
to O
desire O
Waymarsh O
's O
presence O
at O
the O
dock O
, O
that O
had O
led O
him O
thus O
to O
postpone O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
his O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
, O
now O
operated O
to O
make O
him O
feel O
he O
could O
still O
wait O
without O
disappointment O
. O
They O
would O
dine O
together O
at O
the O
worst O
, O
and O
, O
with O
all O
respect O
to O
dear O
old O
Waymarsh O
-- O
if O
not O
even O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
to O
himself O
-- O
there O
was O
little O
fear O
that O
in O
the O
sequel O
they O
should O
n't O
see O
enough O
of O
each O
other O
. O
The O
principle O
I O
have O
just O
mentioned O
as O
operating O
had O
been O
, O
with O
the O
most O
newly O
disembarked O
of O
the O
two O
men O
, O
wholly O
instinctive O
-- O
the O
fruit O
of O
a O
sharp O
sense O
that O
, O
delightful O
as O
it O
would O
be O
to O
find O
himself O
looking O
, O
after O
so O
much O
separation O
, O
into O
his O
comrade O
's O
face O
, O
his O
business O
would O
be O
a O
trifle O
bungled O
should O
he O
simply O
arrange O
for O
this O
countenance O
to O
present O
itself O
to O
the O
nearing O
steamer O
as O
the O
first O
" O
note O
, O
" O
of O
Europe O
. O
Mixed O
with O
everything O
was O
the O
apprehension O
, O
already O
, O
on O
Strether O
's O
part O
, O
that O
it O
would O
, O
at O
best O
, O
throughout O
, O
prove O
the O
note O
of O
Europe O
in O
quite O
a O
sufficient O
degree O
. O
That O
note O
had O
been O
meanwhile O
-- O
since O
the O
previous O
afternoon O
, O
thanks O
to O
this O
happier O
device O
-- O
such O
a O
consciousness O
of O
personal O
freedom O
as O
he O
had O
n't O
known O
for O
years O
; O
such O
a O
deep O
taste O
of O
change O
and O
of O
having O
above O
all O
for O
the O
moment O
nobody O
and O
nothing O
to O
consider O
, O
as O
promised O
already O
, O
if O
headlong O
hope O
were O
not O
too O
foolish O
, O
to O
colour O
his O
adventure O
with O
cool O
success O
. O
There O
were O
people O
on O
the O
ship O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
easily O
consorted O
-- O
so O
far O
as O
ease O
could O
up O
to O
now O
be O
imputed O
to O
him O
-- O
and O
who O
for O
the O
most O
part O
plunged O
straight O
into O
the O
current O
that O
set O
from O
the O
landing-stage O
to O
London O
; O
there O
were O
others O
who O
had O
invited O
him O
to O
a O
tryst O
at O
the O
inn O
and O
had O
even O
invoked O
his O
aid O
for O
a O
" O
look O
round O
" O
at O
the O
beauties O
of O
Liverpool O
; O
but O
he O
had O
stolen O
away O
from O
every O
one O
alike O
, O
had O
kept O
no O
appointment O
and O
renewed O
no O
acquaintance O
, O
had O
been O
indifferently O
aware O
of O
the O
number O
of O

who O
esteemed O
themselves O
fortunate O
in O
being O

evasion O
, O
given O
his O
afternoon O
and O
evening O
to O
the O
immediate O
and O
the O
sensible O
. O
They O
formed O
a O
qualified O
draught O
of O
Europe O
, O
an O
afternoon O
and O
an O
evening O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Mersey O
, O
but O
such O
as O
it O
was O
he O
took O
his O
potion O
at O
least O
undiluted O
. O
He O
winced O
a O
little O
, O
truly O
, O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
Waymarsh O
might O
be O
already O
at O
Chester O
; O
he O
reflected O
that O
, O
should O
he O
have O
to O
describe O
himself O
there O
as O
having O
" O
got O
in O
" O
so O
early O
, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
make O
the O
interval O
look O
particularly O
eager O
; O
but O
he O
was O
like O
a O
man O
who O
, O
elatedly O
finding O
in O
his O
pocket O
more O
money O
than O
usual O
, O
handles O
it O
a O
while O
and O
idly O
and O
pleasantly O
chinks O
it O
before O
addressing O
himself O
to O
the O
business O
of O
spending O
. O
That O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
be O
vague O
to O
Waymarsh O
about O
the O
hour O
of O
the O
ship O
's O
touching O
, O
and O
that O
he O
both O
wanted O
extremely O
to O
see O
him O
and O
enjoyed O
extremely O
the O
duration O
of O
delay O
-- O
these O
things O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
conceived O
, O
were O
early O
signs O
in O
him O
that O
his O
relation O
to O
his O
actual O
errand O
might O
prove O
none O
of O
the O
simplest O
. O
He O
was O
burdened O
, O
poor O
Strether O
-- O
it O
had O
better O
be O
confessed O
at O
the O
outset O
-- O
with O
the O
oddity O
of O
a O
double O
consciousness O
. O
There O
was O
detachment O
in O
his O
zeal O
and O
curiosity O
in O
his O
indifference O
. O
After O
the O
young O
woman O
in O
the O
glass O
cage O
had O
held O
up O
to O
him O
across O
her O
counter O
the O
pale-pink O
leaflet O
bearing O
his O
friend O
's O
name O
, O
which O
she O
neatly O
pronounced O
, O
he O
turned O
away O
to O
find O
himself O
, O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
facing O
a O
lady O
who O
met O
his O
eyes O
as O
with O
an O
intention O
suddenly O
determined O
, O
and O
whose O
features O
-- O
not O
freshly O
young O
, O
not O
markedly O
fine O
, O
but O
on O
happy O
terms O
with O
each O
other O
-- O
came O
back O
to O
him O
as O
from O
a O
recent O
vision O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
they O
stood O
confronted O
; O
then O
the O
moment O
placed O
her O
: O
he O
had O
noticed O
her O
the O
day O
before O
, O
noticed O
her O
at O
his O
previous O
inn O
, O
where O
-- O
again O
in O
the O
hall O
-- O
she O
had O
been O
briefly O
engaged O
with O
some O
people O
of O
his O
own O
ship O
's O
company O
. O
Nothing O
had O
actually O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
and O
he O
would O
as O
little O
have O
been O
able O
to O
say O
what O
had O
been O
the O
sign O
of O
her O
face O
for O
him O
on O
the O
first O
occasion O
as O
to O
name O
the O
ground O
of O
his O
present O
recognition O
. O
Recognition O
at O
any O
rate O
appeared O
to O
prevail O
on O
her O
own O
side O
as O
well O
-- O
which O
would O
only O
have O
added O
to O
the O
mystery O
. O
All O
she O
now O
began O
by O
saying O
to O
him O
nevertheless O
was O
that O
, O
having O
chanced O
to O
catch O
his O
enquiry O
, O
she O
was O
moved O
to O
ask O
, O
by O
his O
leave O
, O
if O
it O
were O
possibly O
a O
question O
of O
Mr. O
Waymarsh O
of O
Milrose O
Connecticut O
-- O
Mr. O
Waymarsh O
the O
American O
lawyer O
. O
" O
Oh O
yes O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
my O
very O
well-known O
friend O
. O
He O
's O
to O
meet O
me O
here O
, O
coming O
up O
from O
Malvern O
, O
and O
I O
supposed O
he O
'd O
already O
have O
arrived O
. O
But O
he O
does O
n't O
come O
till O
later O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
relieved O
not O
to O
have O
kept O
him O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
him O
? O
" O
Strether O
wound O
up O
. O
It O
was O
n't O
till O
after O
he O
had O
spoken O
that O
he O
became O
aware O
of O
how O
much O
there O
had O
been O
in O
him O
of O
response O
; O
when O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
own O
rejoinder O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
play O
of O
something O
more O
in O
her O
face O
-- O
something O
more O
, O
that O
is O
, O
than O
its O
apparently O
usual O
restless O
light O
-- O
seemed O
to O
notify O
him O
. O
" O
I O
've O
met O
him O
at O
Milrose O
-- O
where O
I O
used O
sometimes O
, O
a O
good O
while O
ago O
, O
to O
stay O
; O
I O
had O
friends O
there O
who O
were O
friends O
of O
his O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
at O
his O
house O
. O
I O
wo O
n't O
answer O
for O
it O
that O
he O
would O
know O
me O
, O
" O
Strether O
's O
new O
acquaintance O
pursued O
; O
" O
but O
I O
should O
be O
delighted O
to O
see O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
-- O
for O
I O
'm O
staying O
over O
. O
" O
She O
paused O
while O
our O
friend O
took O
in O
these O
things O
, O
and O
it O
was O
as O
if O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
talk O
had O
already O
passed O
. O
They O
even O
vaguely O
smiled O
at O
it O
, O
and O
Strether O
presently O
observed O
that O
Mr. O
Waymarsh O
would O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
be O
easily O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
This O
, O
however O
, O
appeared O
to O
affect O
the O
lady O
as O
if O
she O
might O
have O
advanced O
too O
far O
. O
She O
appeared O
to O
have O
no O
reserves O
about O
anything O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
he O
wo O
n't O
care O
! O
" O
-- O
and O
she O
immediately O
thereupon O
remarked O
that O
she O
believed O
Strether O
knew O
the O
Munsters O
; O
the O
Munsters O
being O
the O
people O
he O
had O
seen O
her O
with O
at O
Liverpool O
. O
But O
he O
did O
n't O
, O
it O
happened O
, O
know O
the O
Munsters O
well O
enough O
to O
give O
the O
case O
much O
of O
a O
lift O
; O
so O
that O
they O
were O
left O
together O
as O
if O
over O
the O
mere O
laid O
table O
of O
conversation O
. O
Her O
qualification O
of O
the O
mentioned O
connexion O
had O
rather O
removed O
than O
placed O
a O
dish O
, O
and O
there O
seemed O
nothing O
else O
to O
serve O
. O
Their O
attitude O
remained O
, O
none O
the O
less O
, O
that O
of O
not O
forsaking O
the O
board O
; O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
in O
turn O
was O
to O
give O
them O
the O
appearance O
of O
having O
accepted O
each O
other O
with O
an O
absence O
of O
preliminaries O
practically O
complete O
. O
They O
moved O
along O
the O
hall O
together O
, O
and O
Strether O
's O
companion O
threw O
off O
that O
the O
hotel O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
a O
garden O
. O
He O
was O
aware O
by O
this O
time O
of O
his O
strange O
inconsequence O
: O
he O
had O
shirked O
the O
intimacies O
of O
the O
steamer O
and O
had O
muffled O
the O
shock O
of O
Waymarsh O
only O
to O
find O
himself O
forsaken O
, O
in O
this O
sudden O
case O
, O
both O
of O
avoidance O
and O
of O
caution O
. O
He O
passed O
, O
under O
this O
unsought O
protection O
and O
before O
he O
had O
so O
much O
as O
gone O
up O
to O
his O
room O
, O
into O
the O
garden O
of O
the O
hotel O
, O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
ten O
minutes O
had O
agreed O
to O
meet O
there O
again O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
should O
have O
made O
himself O
tidy O
, O
the O
dispenser O
of O
such O
good O
assurances O
. O
He O
wanted O
to O
look O
at O
the O
town O
, O
and O
they O
would O
forthwith O
look O
together O
. O
It O
was O
almost O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
in O
possession O
and O
received O
him O
as O
a O
guest O
. O
Her O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
place O
presented O
her O
in O
a O
manner O
as O
a O
hostess O
, O
and O
Strether O
had O
a O
rueful O
glance O
for O
the O
lady O
in O
the O
glass O
cage O
. O
It O
was O
as O
if O
this O
personage O
had O
seen O
herself O
instantly O
superseded O
. O
When O
in O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
he O
came O
down O
, O
what O
his O
hostess O
saw O
, O
what O
she O
might O
have O
taken O
in O
with O
a O
vision O
kindly O
adjusted O
, O
was O
the O
lean O
, O
the O
slightly O
loose O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
of O
the O
middle O
height O
and O
something O
more O
perhaps O
than O
the O
middle O
age O
-- O
a O
man O
of O
five-and-fifty O
, O
whose O
most O
immediate O
signs O
were O
a O
marked O
bloodless O
brownness O
of O
face O
, O
a O
thick O
dark O
moustache O
, O
of O
characteristically O
American O
cut O
, O
growing O
strong O
and O
falling O
low O
, O
a O
head O
of O
hair O
still O
abundant O
but O
irregularly O
streaked O
with O
grey O
, O
and O
a O
nose O
of O
bold O
free O
prominence O
, O
the O
even O
line O
, O
the O
high O
finish O
, O
as O
it O
might O
have O
been O
called O
, O
of O
which O
, O
had O
a O
certain O
effect O
of O
mitigation O
. O
A O
perpetual O
pair O
of O
glasses O
astride O
of O
this O
fine O
ridge O
, O
and O
a O
line O
, O
unusually O
deep O
and O
drawn O
, O
the O
prolonged O
pen-stroke O
of O
time O
, O
accompanying O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
moustache O
from O
nostril O
to O
chin O
, O
did O
something O
to O
complete O
the O
facial O
furniture O
that O
an O
attentive O
observer O
would O
have O
seen O
catalogued O
, O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
in O
the O
vision O
of O
the O
other O
party O
to O
Strether O
's O
appointment O
. O
She O
waited O
for O
him O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
the O
other O
party O
, O
drawing O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
singularly O
fresh O
soft O
and O
elastic O
light O
gloves O
and O
presenting O
herself O
with O
a O
superficial O
readiness O
which O
, O
as O
he O
approached O
her O
over O
the O
small O
smooth O
lawn O
and O
in O
the O
watery O
English O
sunshine O
, O
he O
might O
, O
with O
his O
rougher O
preparation O
, O
have O
marked O
as O
the O
model O
for O
such O
an O
occasion O
. O
She O
had O
, O
this O
lady O
, O
a O
perfect O
plain O
propriety O
, O
an O
expensive O
subdued O
suitability O
, O
that O
her O
companion O
was O
not O
free O
to O
analyse O
, O
but O
that O
struck O
him O
, O
so O
that O
his O
consciousness O
of O
it O
was O
instantly O
acute O
, O
as O
a O
quality O
quite O
new O
to O
him O
. O
Before O
reaching O
her O
he O
stopped O
on O
the O
grass O
and O
went O
through O
the O
form O
of O
feeling O
for O
something O
, O
possibly O
forgotten O
, O
in O
the O
light O
overcoat O
he O
carried O
on O
his O
arm O
; O
yet O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
act O
was O
no O
more O
than O
the O
impulse O
to O
gain O
time O
. O
Nothing O
could O
have O
been O
odder O
than O
Strether O
's O
sense O
of O
himself O
as O
at O
that O
moment O
launched O
in O
something O
of O
which O
the O
sense O
would O
be O
quite O
disconnected O
from O
the O
sense O
of O
his O
past O
and O
which O
was O
literally O
beginning O
there O
and O
then O
. O
It O
had O
begun O
in O
fact O
already O
upstairs O
and O
before O
the O
dressing O
glass O
that O
struck O
him O
as O
blocking O
further O
, O
so O
strangely O
, O
the O
dimness O
of O
the O
window O
of O
his O
dull O
bedroom O
; O
begun O
with O
a O
sharper O
survey O
of O
the O
elements O
of O
Appearance O
than O
he O
had O
for O
a O
long O
time O
been O
moved O
to O
make O
. O
He O
had O
during O
those O
moments O
felt O
these O
elements O
to O
be O
not O
so O
much O
to O
his O
hand O
as O
he O
should O
have O
liked O
, O
and O
then O
had O
fallen O
back O
on O
the O
thought O
that O
they O
were O
precisely O
a O
matter O
as O
to O
which O
help O
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
from O
what O
he O
was O
about O
to O
do O
. O
He O
was O
about O
to O
go O
up O
to O
London O
, O
so O
that O
hat O
and O
necktie O
might O
wait O
. O
What O
had O
come O
as O
straight O
to O
him O
as O
a O
ball O
in O
a O
well-played O
game O
-- O
and O
caught O
moreover O
not O
less O
neatly O
-- O
was O
just O
the O
air O
, O
in O
the O
person O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
of O
having O
seen O
and O
chosen O
, O
the O
air O
of O
achieved O
possession O
of O
those O
vague O
qualities O
and O
quantities O
that O
collectively O
figured O
to O
him O
as O
the O
advantage O
snatched O
from O
lucky O
chances O
. O
Without O
pomp O
or O
circumstance O
, O
certainly O
, O
as O
her O
original O
address O
to O
him O
, O
equally O
with O
his O
own O
response O
, O
had O
been O
, O
he O
would O
have O
sketched O
to O
himself O
his O
impression O
of O
her O
as O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
she O
's O
more O
thoroughly O
civilized O
-- O
! O
" O
If O
" O
More O
thoroughly O
than O
WHOM O
? O
" O
would O
not O
have O
been O
for O
him O
a O
sequel O
to O
this O
remark O
, O
that O
was O
just O
by O
reason O
of O
his O
deep O
consciousness O
of O
the O
bearing O
of O
his O
comparison O
. O

CHAPTER O
I O
I PRON_PER
TAKE O
A O
COUNTRY O
HOUSE O
This O
is O
the O
story O
of O
how O
a NOM_PER
middle-aged NOM_PER
spinster NOM_PER
lost O
her PRON_PER
mind O
, O
deserted O
her NOM_PER
domestic NOM_PER
gods NOM_PER
in O
the O
city O
, O
took O
a O
furnished O
house O
for O
the O
summer O
out O
of O
town O
, O
and O
found O
herself O
involved O
in O
one O
of O
those O
mysterious O
crimes O
that O
keep O
our O
newspapers O
and O
detective O
agencies O
happy O
and O
prosperous O
. O
For O
twenty O
years O
I O
had O
been O
perfectly O
comfortable O
; O
for O
twenty O
years O
I O
had O
had O
the O
window-boxes O
filled O
in O
the O
spring O
, O
the O
carpets O
lifted O
, O
the O
awnings O
put O
up O
and O
the O
furniture O
covered O
with O
brown O
linen O
; O
for O
as O
many O
summers O
I O
had O
said O
good-by O
to O
my O
friends O
, O
and O
, O
after O
watching O
their O
perspiring O
hegira O
, O
had O
settled O
down O
to O
a O
delicious O
quiet O
in O
town O
, O
where O
the O
mail O
comes O
three O
times O
a O
day O
, O
and O
the O
water O
supply O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
a O
tank O
on O
the O
roof O
. O
And O
then O
-- O
the O
madness O
seized O
me O
. O
When O
I O
look O
back O
over O
the O
months O
I O
spent O
at O
Sunnyside O
, O
I O
wonder O
that O
I O
survived O
at O
all O
. O
As O
it O
is O
, O
I O
show O
the O
wear O
and O
tear O
of O
my O
harrowing O
experiences O
. O
I O
have O
turned O
very O
gray O
-- O
Liddy O
reminded O
me O
of O
it O
, O
only O
yesterday O
, O
by O
saying O
that O
a O
little O
bluing O
in O
the O
rinse-water O
would O
make O
my O
hair O
silvery O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
yellowish O
white O
. O
I O
hate O
to O
be O
reminded O
of O
unpleasant O
things O
and O
I O
snapped O
her O
off O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
I O
said O
sharply O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
use O
bluing O
at O
my O
time O
of O
life O
, O
or O
starch O
, O
either O
. O
" O
Liddy O
's O
nerves O
are O
gone O
, O
she O
says O
, O
since O
that O
awful O
summer O
, O
but O
she O
has O
enough O
left O
, O
goodness O
knows O
! O
And O
when O
she O
begins O
to O
go O
around O
with O
a O
lump O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
all O
I O
have O
to O
do O
is O
to O
threaten O
to O
return O
to O
Sunnyside O
, O
and O
she O
is O
frightened O
into O
a O
semblance O
of O
cheerfulness O
, O
-- O
from O
which O
you O
may O
judge O
that O
the O
summer O
there O
was O
anything O
but O
a O
success O
. O
The O
newspaper O
accounts O
have O
been O
so O
garbled O
and O
incomplete O
-- O
one O
of O
them O
mentioned O
me O
but O
once O
, O
and O
then O
only O
as O
the O
tenant O
at O
the O
time O
the O
thing O
happened O
-- O
that O
I O
feel O
it O
my O
due O
to O
tell O
what O
I O
know O
. O
Mr. O
Jamieson O
, O
the O
detective O
, O
said O
himself O
he O
could O
never O
have O
done O
without O
me O
, O
although O
he O
gave O
me O
little O
enough O
credit O
, O
in O
print O
. O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
go O
back O
several O
years O
-- O
thirteen O
, O
to O
be O
exact O
-- O
to O
start O
my O
story O
. O
At O
that O
time O
my O
brother O
died O
, O
leaving O
me O
his O
two O
children O
. O
Halsey O
was O
eleven O
then O
, O
and O
Gertrude O
was O
seven O
. O
All O
the O
responsibilities O
of O
maternity O
were O
thrust O
upon O
me O
suddenly O
; O
to O
perfect O
the O
profession O
of O
motherhood O
requires O
precisely O
as O
many O
years O
as O
the O
child O
has O
lived O
, O
like O
the O
man O
who O
started O
to O
carry O
the O
calf O
and O
ended O
by O
walking O
along O
with O
the O
bull O
on O
his O
shoulders O
. O
However O
, O
I O
did O
the O
best O
I O
could O
. O
When O
Gertrude O
got O
past O
the O
hair-ribbon O
age O
, O
and O
Halsey O
asked O
for O
a O
scarf-pin O
and O
put O
on O
long O
trousers O
-- O
and O
a O
wonderful O
help O
that O
was O
to O
the O
darning O
. O
-- O
I O
sent O
them O
away O
to O
good O
schools O
. O
After O
that O
, O
my O
responsibility O
was O
chiefly O
postal O
, O
with O
three O
months O
every O
summer O
in O
which O
to O
replenish O
their O
wardrobes O
, O
look O
over O
their O
lists O
of O
acquaintances O
, O
and O
generally O
to O
take O
my O
foster-motherhood O
out O
of O
its O
nine O
months O
' O
retirement O
in O
camphor O
. O
I O
missed O
the O
summers O
with O
them O
when O
, O
somewhat O
later O
, O
at O
boarding-school O
and O
college O
, O
the O
children O
spent O
much O
of O
their O
vacations O
with O
friends O
. O
Gradually O
I O
found O
that O
my O
name O
signed O
to O
a O
check O
was O
even O
more O
welcome O
than O
when O
signed O
to O
a O
letter O
, O
though O
I O
wrote O
them O
at O
stated O
intervals O
. O
But O
when O
Halsey O
had O
finished O
his O
electrical O
course O
and O
Gertrude O
her O
boarding-school O
, O
and O
both O
came O
home O
to O
stay O
, O
things O
were O
suddenly O
changed O
. O
The O
winter O
Gertrude O
came O
out O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
succession O
of O
sitting O
up O
late O
at O
night O
to O
bring O
her O
home O
from O
things O
, O
taking O
her O
to O
the O
dressmakers O
between O
naps O
the O
next O
day O
, O
and O
discouraging O
ineligible O
youths O
with O
either O
more O
money O
than O
brains O
, O
or O
more O
brains O
than O
money O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
acquired O
a O
great O
many O
things O
: O
to O
say O
lingerie O
for O
under-garments O
, O
" O
frocks O
" O
and O
" O
gowns O
" O
instead O
of O
dresses O
, O
and O
that O
beardless O
sophomores O
are O
not O
college O
boys O
, O
but O
college O
men O
. O
Halsey O
required O
less O
personal O
supervision O
, O
and O
as O
they O
both O
got O
their O
mother O
's O
fortune O
that O
winter O
, O
my O
responsibility O
became O
purely O
moral O
. O
Halsey O
bought O
a O
car O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
I O
learned O
how O
to O
tie O
over O
my O
bonnet O
a O
gray O
baize O
veil O
, O
and O
, O
after O
a O
time O
, O
never O
to O
stop O
to O
look O
at O
the O
dogs O
one O
has O
run O
down O
. O
People O
are O
apt O
to O
be O
so O
unpleasant O
about O
their O
dogs O
. O
The O
additions O
to O
my O
education O
made O
me O
a O
properly O
equipped O
maiden O
aunt O
, O
and O
by O
spring O
I O
was O
quite O
tractable O
. O
So O
when O
Halsey O
suggested O
camping O
in O
the O
Adirondacks O
and O
Gertrude O
wanted O
Bar O
Harbor O
, O
we O
compromised O
on O
a O
good O
country O
house O
with O
links O
near O
, O
within O
motor O
distance O
of O
town O
and O
telephone O
distance O
of O
the O
doctor O
. O
That O
was O
how O
we O
went O
to O
Sunnyside O
. O
We O
went O
out O
to O
inspect O
the O
property O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
deserve O
its O
name O
. O
Its O
cheerful O
appearance O
gave O
no O
indication O
whatever O
of O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O
Only O
one O
thing O
seemed O
unusual O
to O
me O
: O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
had O
been O
left O
in O
charge O
, O
had O
moved O
from O
the O
house O
to O
the O
gardener O
's O
lodge O
, O
a O
few O
days O
before O
. O
As O
the O
lodge O
was O
far O
enough O
away O
from O
the O
house O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
either O
fire O
or O
thieves O
could O
complete O
their O
work O
of O
destruction O
undisturbed O
. O
The O
property O
was O
an O
extensive O
one O
: O
the O
house O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
hill O
, O
which O
sloped O
away O
in O
great O
stretches O
of O
green O
lawn O
and O
clipped O
hedges O
, O
to O
the O
road O
; O
and O
across O
the O
valley O
, O
perhaps O
a O
couple O
of O
miles O
away O
, O
was O
the O
Greenwood O
Club O
House O
. O
Gertrude O
and O
Halsey O
were O
infatuated O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
it O
's O
everything O
you O
want O
, O
" O
Halsey O
said O
" O
View O
, O
air O
, O
good O
water O
and O
good O
roads O
. O
As O
for O
the O
house O
, O
it O
's O
big O
enough O
for O
a O
hospital O
, O
if O
it O
has O
a O
Queen O
Anne O
front O
and O
a O
Mary O
Anne O
back O
, O
" O
which O
was O
ridiculous O
: O
it O
was O
pure O
Elizabethan O
. O
Of O
course O
we O
took O
the O
place O
; O
it O
was O
not O
my O
idea O
of O
comfort O
, O
being O
much O
too O
large O
and O
sufficiently O
isolated O
to O
make O
the O
servant O
question O
serious O
. O
But O
I O
give O
myself O
credit O
for O
this O
: O
whatever O
has O
happened O
since O
, O
I O
never O
blamed O
Halsey O
and O
Gertrude O
for O
taking O
me O
there O
. O
And O
another O
thing O
: O
if O
the O
series O
of O
catastrophes O
there O
did O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
taught O
me O
one O
thing O
-- O
that O
somehow O
, O
somewhere O
, O
from O
perhaps O
a O
half-civilized O
ancestor O
who O
wore O
a O
sheepskin O
garment O
and O
trailed O
his O
food O
or O
his O
prey O
, O
I O
have O
in O
me O
the O
instinct O
of O
the O
chase O
. O
Were O
I O
a O
man O
I O
should O
be O
a O
trapper O
of O
criminals O
, O
trailing O
them O
as O
relentlessly O
as O
no O
doubt O
my O
sheepskin O
ancestor O
did O
his O
wild O
boar O
. O
But O
being O
an O
unmarried O
woman O
, O
with O
the O
handicap O
of O
my O
sex O
, O
my O
first O
acquaintance O
with O
crime O
will O
probably O
be O
my O
last O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
came O
near O
enough O
to O
being O
my O
last O
acquaintance O
with O
anything O
. O
The O
property O
was O
owned O
by O
Paul O
Armstrong O
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Traders O
' O
Bank O
, O
who O
at O
the O
time O
we O
took O
the O
house O
was O
in O
the O
west O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
daughter O
, O
and O
a O
Doctor O
Walker O
, O
the O
Armstrong O
family O
physician O
. O
Halsey O
knew O
Louise O
Armstrong O
, O
-- O
had O
been O
rather O
attentive O
to O
her O
the O
winter O
before O
, O
but O
as O
Halsey O
was O
always O
attentive O
to O
somebody O
, O
I O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
it O
seriously O
, O
although O
she O
was O
a O
charming O
girl O
. O
I O
knew O
of O
Mr. O
Armstrong O
only O
through O
his O
connection O
with O
the O
bank O
, O
where O
the O
children O
's O
money O
was O
largely O
invested O
, O
and O
through O
an O
ugly O
story O
about O
the O
son O
, O
Arnold O
Armstrong O
, O
who O
was O
reported O
to O
have O
forged O
his O
father O
's O
name O
, O
for O
a O
considerable O
amount O
, O
to O
some O
bank O
paper O
. O
However O
, O
the O
story O
had O
had O
no O
interest O
for O
me O
. O
I O
cleared O
Halsey O
and O
Gertrude O
away O
to O
a O
house O
party O
, O
and O
moved O
out O
to O
Sunnyside O
the O
first O
of O
May O
. O
The O
roads O
were O
bad O
, O
but O
the O
trees O
were O
in O
leaf O
, O
and O
there O
were O
still O
tulips O
in O
the O
borders O
around O
the O
house O
. O
The O
arbutus O
was O
fragrant O
in O
the O
woods O
under O
the O
dead O
leaves O
, O
and O
on O
the O
way O
from O
the O
station O
, O
a O
short O
mile O
, O
while O
the O
car O
stuck O
in O
the O
mud O
, O
I O
found O
a O
bank O
showered O
with O
tiny O
forget-me-nots O
. O
The O
birds O
-- O
do O
n't O
ask O
me O
what O
kind O
; O
they O
all O
look O
alike O
to O
me O
, O
unless O
they O
have O
a O
hall O
mark O
of O
some O
bright O
color O
-- O
the O
birds O
were O
chirping O
in O
the O
hedges O
, O
and O
everything O
breathed O
of O
peace O
. O
Liddy O
, O
who O
was O
born O
and O
bred O
on O
a O
brick O
pavement O
, O
got O
a O
little O
bit O
down-spirited O
when O
the O
crickets O
began O
to O
chirp O
, O
or O
scrape O
their O
legs O
together O
, O
or O
whatever O
it O
is O
they O
do O
, O
at O
twilight O
. O
The O
first O
night O
passed O
quietly O
enough O
. O
I O
have O
always O
been O
grateful O
for O
that O
one O
night O
's O
peace O
; O
it O
shows O
what O
the O
country O
might O
be O
, O
under O
favorable O
circumstances O
. O
Never O
after O
that O
night O
did O
I O
put O
my O
head O
on O
my O
pillow O
with O
any O
assurance O
how O
long O
it O
would O
be O
there O
; O
or O
on O
my O
shoulders O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
. O
On O
the O
following O
morning O
Liddy O
and O
Mrs. O
Ralston O
, O
my O
own O
housekeeper O
, O
had O
a O
difference O
of O
opinion O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Ralston O
left O
on O
the O
eleven O
train O
. O
Just O
after O
luncheon O
, O
Burke O
, O
the O
butler O
, O
was O
taken O
unexpectedly O
with O
a O
pain O
in O
his O
right O
side O
, O
much O
worse O
when O
I O
was O
within O
hearing O
distance O
, O
and O
by O
afternoon O
he O
was O
started O
cityward O
. O
That O
night O
the O
cook O
's O
sister O
had O
a O
baby O
-- O
the O
cook O
, O
seeing O
indecision O
in O
my O
face O
, O
made O
it O
twins O
on O
second O
thought O
-- O
and O
, O
to O
be O
short O
, O
by O
noon O
the O
next O
day O
the O
household O
staff O
was O
down O
to O
Liddy O
and O
myself O
. O
And O
this O
in O
a O
house O
with O
twenty-two O
rooms O
and O
five O
baths O
! O
Liddy O
wanted O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
city O
at O
once O
, O
but O
the O
milk-boy O
said O
that O
Thomas O
Johnson O
, O
the O
Armstrongs O
' O
colored O
butler O
, O
was O
working O
as O
a O
waiter O
at O
the O
Greenwood O
Club O
, O
and O
might O
come O
back O
. O
I O
have O
the O
usual O
scruples O
about O
coercing O
people O
's O
servants O
away O
, O
but O
few O
of O
us O
have O
any O
conscience O
regarding O
institutions O
or O
corporations O
-- O
witness O
the O
way O
we O
beat O
railroads O
and O
street-car O
companies O
when O
we O
can O
-- O
so O
I O
called O
up O
the O
club O
, O
and O
about O
eight O
o'clock O
Thomas O
Johnson O
came O
to O
see O
me O
. O
Poor O
Thomas O
! O
Well O
, O
it O
ended O
by O
my O
engaging O
Thomas O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
at O
outrageous O
wages O
, O
and O
with O
permission O
to O
sleep O
in O
the O
gardener O
's O
lodge O
, O
empty O
since O
the O
house O
was O
rented O
. O
The O
old O
man O
-- O
he O
was O
white-haired O
and O
a O
little O
stooped O
, O
but O
with O
an O
immense O
idea O
of O
his O
personal O
dignity O

gave O
me O

As O
the NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
New NOM_PER
England NOM_PER

is O
proverbially O
old O
, O
so O
the NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
small NOM_PER

towns NOM_PER
twenty-five O
years O
ago O
was O
generally O
young O
. O
Dr. PROP_PER
Archie PROP_PER
was O
barely O
thirty O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
tall O
, O
with O
massive O
shoulders O
which O
he PRON_PER
held O
stiffly O
, O
and O
a O
large O
, O
well-shaped O
head O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
a NOM_PER
distinguished-looking NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
, O
for O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
at O
least O
. O
There O
was O
something O
individual O
in O
the O
way O
in O
which O
his PRON_PER
reddish-brown O
hair O
, O
parted O
cleanly O
at O
the O
side O
, O
bushed O
over O
his PRON_PER
high O
forehead O
. O
His PRON_PER
nose O
was O
straight O
and O
thick O
, O
and O
his PRON_PER
eyes O
were O
intelligent O
. O
He PRON_PER
wore O
a O
curly O
, O
reddish O
mustache O
and O
an O
imperial O
, O
cut O
trimly O
, O
which O
made O
him PRON_PER
look O
a O
little O
like O
the O
pictures O
of O
Napoleon PROP_PER
III PROP_PER
. O
His PRON_PER
hands O
were O
large O
and O
well O
kept O
, O
but O
ruggedly O
formed O
, O
and O
the O
backs O
were O
shaded O
with O
crinkly O
reddish O
hair O
. O
He PRON_PER
wore O
a O
blue O
suit O
of O
woolly O
, O
wide-waled O
serge O
; O
the NOM_PER
traveling NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
had O
known O
at O
a O
glance O
that O
it O
was O
made O
by O
a NOM_PER
Denver NOM_PER
tailor NOM_PER
. O
The NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
was O
always O
well O
dressed O
. O
Dr. PROP_PER
Archie PROP_PER
turned O
up O
the O
student O
's O
lamp O
and O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
swivel O
chair O
before O
his PRON_PER
desk O
. O
He PRON_PER
sat O
uneasily O
, O
beating O
a O
tattoo O
on O
his PRON_PER
knees O
with O
his PRON_PER
fingers O
, O
and O
looked O
about O
him PRON_PER
as O
if O
he PRON_PER
were O
bored O
. O
He PRON_PER
glanced O
at O
his PRON_PER
watch O
, O
then O
absently O
took O
from O
his PRON_PER
pocket O
a O
bunch O
of O
small O
keys O
, O
selected O
one O
and O
looked O
at O
it O
. O
A O
contemptuous O
smile O
, O
barely O
perceptible O
, O
played O
on O
his PRON_PER
lips O
, O
but O
his PRON_PER
eyes O
remained O
meditative O
. O
Behind O
the O
door O
that O
led O
into O
the O
hall O
, O
under O
his PRON_PER
buffalo-skin O
driving-coat O
, O
was O
a O
locked O
cupboard O
. O
This O
the NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
opened O
mechanically O
, O
kicking O
aside O
a O
pile O
of O
muddy O
overshoes O
. O
Inside O
, O
on O
the O
shelves O
, O
were O
whiskey O
glasses O
and O
decanters O
, O
lemons O
, O
sugar O
, O
and O
bitters O
. O
Hearing O
a O
step O
in O
the O
empty O
, O
echoing O
hall O
without O
, O
the NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
closed O
the O
cupboard O
again O
, O
snapping O
the O
Yale O
lock O
. O
The O
door O
of O
the O
waiting-room O
opened O
, O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
entered O
and O
came O
on O
into O
the O
consulting-room O
. O
" O
Good-evening O
, O
Mr. PROP_PER
Kronborg PROP_PER
, O
" O
said O
the NOM_PER
doctor NOM_PER
carelessly O
. O
" O
Sit O
down O
. O
" O
His NOM_PER
visitor NOM_PER
was O
a O
tall O
, O
loosely O
built O
man O
, O
with O
a O
thin O
brown O
beard O
, O
streaked O
with O
gray O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
frock O
coat O
, O
a O
broad-brimmed O
black O
hat O
, O
a O
white O
lawn O
necktie O
, O
and O
steel O
rimmed O
spectacles O
. O
Altogether O
there O
was O
a O
pretentious O
and O
important O
air O
about O
him O
, O
as O
he O
lifted O
the O
skirts O
of O
his O
coat O
and O
sat O
down O
. O
" O
Good-evening O
, O
doctor O
. O
Can O
you O
step O
around O
to O
the O
house O
with O
me O
? O
I O
think O
Mrs. O
Kronborg O
will O
need O
you O
this O
evening O
. O
" O
This O
was O
said O
with O
profound O
gravity O
and O
, O
curiously O
enough O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
embarrassment O
. O
" O
Any O
hurry O
? O
" O
the O
doctor O
asked O
over O
his O
shoulder O
as O
he O
went O
into O
his O
operating-room O
. O
Mr. O
Kronborg O
coughed O
behind O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
contracted O
his O
brows O
. O
His O
face O
threatened O
at O
every O
moment O
to O
break O
into O
a O
smile O
of O
foolish O
excitement O
. O
He O
controlled O
it O
only O
by O
calling O
upon O
his O
habitual O
pulpit O
manner O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
as O
well O
to O
go O
immediately O
. O
Mrs. O
Kronborg O
will O
be O
more O
comfortable O
if O
you O
are O
there O
. O
She O
has O
been O
suffering O
for O
some O
time O
. O
" O
The O
doctor O
came O
back O
and O
threw O
a O
black O
bag O
upon O
his O
desk O
. O
He O
wrote O
some O
instructions O
for O
his O
man O
on O
a O
prescription O
pad O
and O
then O
drew O
on O
his O
overcoat O
. O
" O
All O
ready O
, O
" O
he O
announced O
, O
putting O
out O
his O
lamp O
. O
Mr. O
Kronborg O
rose O
and O
they O
tramped O
through O
the O
empty O
hall O
and O
down O
the O
stairway O
to O
the O
street O
. O
The O
drug O
store O
below O
was O
dark O
, O
and O
the O
saloon O
next O
door O
was O
just O
closing O
. O
Every O
other O
light O
on O
Main O
Street O
was O
out O
. O
On O
either O
side O
of O
the O
road O
and O
at O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
the O
board O
sidewalk O
, O
the O
snow O
had O
been O
shoveled O
into O
breastworks O
. O
The O
town O
looked O
small O
and O
black O
, O
flattened O
down O
in O
the O
snow O
, O
muffled O
and O
all O
but O
extinguished O
. O
Overhead O
the O
stars O
shone O
gloriously O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
notice O
them O
. O
The O
air O
was O
so O
clear O
that O
the O
white O
sand O
hills O
to O
the O
east O
of O
Moonstone O
gleamed O
softly O
. O
Following O
the O
Reverend O
Mr. O
Kronborg O
along O
the O
narrow O
walk O
, O
past O
the O
little O
dark O
, O
sleeping O
houses O
, O
the O
doctor O
looked O
up O
at O
the O
flashing O
night O
and O
whistled O
softly O
. O
It O
did O
seem O
that O
people O
were O
stupider O
than O
they O
need O
be O
; O
as O
if O
on O
a O
night O
like O
this O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
something O
better O
to O
do O
than O
to O
sleep O
nine O
hours O
, O
or O
to O
assist O
Mrs. O
Kronborg O
in O
functions O
which O
she O
could O
have O
performed O
so O
admirably O
unaided O
. O
He O
wished O
he O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
Denver O
to O
hear O
Fay O
Templeton O
sing O
" O
See-Saw O
. O
" O
Then O
he O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
a O
personal O
interest O
in O
this O
family O
, O
after O
all O
. O
They O
turned O
into O
another O
street O
and O
saw O
before O
them O
lighted O
windows O
; O
a O
low O
story-and-a-half O
house O
, O
with O
a O
wing O
built O
on O
at O
the O
right O
and O
a O
kitchen O
addition O
at O
the O
back O
, O
everything O
a O
little O
on O
the O
slant O
-- O
roofs O
, O
windows O
, O
and O
doors O
. O
As O
they O
approached O
the O
gate O
, O
Peter O
Kronborg O
's O
pace O
grew O
brisker O
. O
His O
nervous O
, O
ministerial O
cough O
annoyed O
the O
doctor O
. O
" O
Exactly O
as O
if O
he O
were O
going O
to O
give O
out O
a O
text O
, O
" O
he O
thought O
. O
He O
drew O
off O
his O
glove O
and O
felt O
in O
his O
vest O
pocket O
. O
" O
Have O
a O
troche O
, O
Kronborg O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
producing O
some O
. O
" O
Sent O
me O
for O
samples O
. O
Very O
good O
for O
a O
rough O
throat O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
, O
thank O
you O
, O
thank O
you O
. O
I O
was O
in O
something O
of O
a O
hurry O
. O
I O
neglected O
to O
put O
on O
my O
overshoes O
. O
Here O
we O
are O
, O
doctor O
. O
" O
Kronborg O
opened O
his O
front O
door O
-- O
seemed O
delighted O
to O
be O
at O
home O
again O
. O
The O
front O
hall O
was O
dark O
and O
cold O
; O
the O
hatrack O
was O
hung O
with O
an O
astonishing O
number O
of O
children O
's O
hats O
and O
caps O
and O
cloaks O
. O
They O
were O
even O
piled O
on O
the O
table O
beneath O
the O
hatrack O
. O
Under O
the O
table O
was O
a O
heap O
of O
rubbers O
and O
overshoes O
. O
While O
the O
doctor O
hung O
up O
his O
coat O
and O
hat O
, O
Peter O
Kronborg O
opened O
the O
door O
into O
the O
living-room O
. O
A O
glare O
of O
light O
greeted O
them O
, O
and O
a O
rush O
of O
hot O
, O
stale O
air O
, O
smelling O
of O
warming O
flannels O
. O
At O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
Dr. O
Archie O
was O
in O
the O
parlor O
putting O
on O
his O
cuffs O
and O
coat O
-- O
there O
was O
no O
spare O
bedroom O
in O
that O
house O
. O
Peter O
Kronborg O
's O
seventh O
child O
, O
a O
boy O
, O
was O
being O
soothed O
and O
cosseted O
by O
his O
aunt O
, O
Mrs. O
Kronborg O
was O
asleep O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
was O
going O
home O
. O
But O
he O
wanted O
first O
to O
speak O
to O
Kronborg O
, O
who O
, O
coatless O
and O
fluttery O
, O
was O
pouring O
coal O
into O
the O
kitchen O
stove O
. O
As O
the O
doctor O
crossed O
the O
dining-room O
he O
paused O
and O
listened O
. O
From O
one O
of O
the O
wing O
rooms O
, O
off O
to O
the O
left O
, O
he O
heard O
rapid O
, O
distressed O
breathing O
. O
He O
went O
to O
the O
kitchen O
door O
. O
" O
One O
of O
the O
children O
sick O
in O
there O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
, O
nodding O
toward O
the O
partition O
. O
Kronborg O
hung O
up O
the O
stove-lifter O
and O
dusted O
his O
fingers O
. O
" O
It O
must O
be O
Thea O
. O
I O
meant O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
look O
at O
her O
. O
She O
has O
a O
croupy O
cold O
. O
But O
in O
my O
excitement O
-- O
Mrs. O
Kronborg O
is O
doing O
finely O

eh O
, O
doctor O
? O
Not O
many O
of O
your O

I O
expect O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O
She O
's O
a O
fine O
mother O
. O
" O
The O
doctor O
took O
up O
the O
lamp O
from O
the O
kitchen O
table O
and O
unceremoniously O
went O
into O
the O
wing O
room O
. O
Two O
chubby O
little O
boys O
were O
asleep O
in O
a O
double O
bed O
, O
with O
the O
coverlids O
over O
their O
noses O
and O
their O
feet O
drawn O
up O
. O
In O
a O
single O
bed O
, O
next O
to O
theirs O
, O
lay O
a O
little O
girl O
of O
eleven O
, O
wide O
awake O
, O
two O
yellow O
braids O
sticking O
up O
on O
the O
pillow O
behind O
her O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
scarlet O
and O
her O
eyes O
were O
blazing O
. O
The O
doctor O
shut O
the O
door O
behind O
him O
. O
" O
Feel O
pretty O
sick O
, O
Thea O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
as O
he O
took O
out O
his O
thermometer O
. O
" O
Why O
did O
n't O
you O
call O
somebody O
? O
" O
She O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
greedy O
affection O
. O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
here O
, O
" O
she O
spoke O
between O
quick O
breaths O

" O
There O
is O
a O
new O
baby O
, O

there O
? O

" O
Which O

" O
repeated O
the O
doctor O

" O
Brother O

" O
He O
smiled O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bed O

" O
Brother O

he O
said O

taking O
her O
hand O

" O
Open O

" O
" O
Good O

better O

she O
murmured O
as O
he O
put O
the O
glass O
tube O
under O
her O
tongue O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
be O
still O

I O

" O
Dr. O
Archie O
reached O
for O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
out O
his O
watch O
. O
When O
he O
put O
her O
hand O
back O
under O
the O
quilt O
he O
went O
over O
to O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
-- O
they O
were O
both O
tight O
shut O

and O
lifted O
it O
a O
little O
way O

He O
reached O
up O

ran O
his O

along O
the O
cold O

unpapered O
wall O

over O

his O

He O
winked O
at O
her O
from O
the O
door O

shut O
it O

Peter O

sitting O
in O
his O

His O

his O

his O

beckoned O

said O
sternly O
: O

the O

dipped O
down O
into O
a O
little O
hollow O
, O
fringed O
with O
alders O
and O
ladies O
’ O
eardrops O
and O
traversed O
by O
a O
brook O
that O
had O
its O
source O
away O
back O
in O
the O
woods O
of O
the O
old O
Cuthbert O
place O

it O
was O
reputed O
to O

an O
intricate O

headlong O
brook O
in O
its O

Hollow O
it O
was O
a O
quiet O
, O
well-conducted O
little O
stream O
, O
for O
not O
even O
a O
brook O
could O
run O
past O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
Lynde O
’s O
door O
without O
due O
regard O
for O
decency O
and O
decorum O
; O
it O
probably O
was O
conscious O
that O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
was O
sitting O
at O
her O
window O
, O
keeping O
a O
sharp O
eye O
on O
everything O
that O
passed O
, O
from O
brooks O
and O
children O
up O
, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
noticed O
anything O
odd O
or O
out O
of O
place O
she O
would O
never O
rest O
until O
she O
had O
ferreted O
out O
the O
whys O
and O
wherefores O
thereof O
. O
There O
are O
plenty O
of O
people O
in O
Avonlea O
and O
out O
of O
it O
, O
who O
can O
attend O
closely O
to O
their O
neighbor O
’s O
business O
by O
dint O
of O
neglecting O
their O
own O
; O
but O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
Lynde O
was O
one O
of O
those O
capable O
creatures O
who O
can O
manage O
their O
own O
concerns O
and O
those O
of O
other O
folks O
into O
the O
bargain O
. O
She O
was O
a O
notable O
housewife O
; O
her O
work O
was O
always O
done O
and O
well O
done O
; O
she O
" O
ran O
" O
the O
Sewing O
Circle O
, O
helped O
run O
the O
Sunday-school O
, O
and O
was O
the O
strongest O
prop O
of O
the O
Church O
Aid O
Society O
and O
Foreign O
Missions O
Auxiliary O
. O
Yet O
with O
all O
this O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
found O
abundant O
time O
to O
sit O
for O
hours O
at O
her O
kitchen O
window O
, O
knitting O
" O
cotton O
warp O
" O
quilts O
-- O
she O
had O
knitted O
sixteen O
of O
them O
, O
as O
Avonlea O
housekeepers O
were O
wont O
to O
tell O
in O
awed O
voices O
-- O
and O
keeping O
a O
sharp O
eye O
on O
the O
main O
road O
that O
crossed O
the O
hollow O
and O
wound O
up O
the O
steep O
red O
hill O
beyond O
. O
Since O
Avonlea O
occupied O
a O
little O
triangular O
peninsula O
jutting O
out O
into O
the O
Gulf O
of O
St. O
Lawrence O
with O
water O
on O
two O
sides O
of O
it O
, O
anybody O
who O
went O
out O
of O
it O
or O
into O
it O
had O
to O
pass O
over O
that O
hill O
road O
and O
so O
run O
the O
unseen O
gauntlet O
of O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
’s O
all-seeing O
eye O
. O
She O
was O
sitting O
there O
one O
afternoon O
in O
early O
June O
. O
The O
sun O
was O
coming O
in O
at O
the O
window O
warm O
and O
bright O
; O
the O
orchard O
on O
the O
slope O
below O
the O
house O
was O
in O
a O
bridal O
flush O
of O
pinky-white O
bloom O
, O
hummed O
over O
by O
a O
myriad O
of O
bees O
. O
Thomas O
Lynde O
-- O
a O
meek O
little O
man O
whom O
Avonlea O
people O
called O
" O
Rachel O
Lynde O
’s O
husband O
" O
-- O
was O
sowing O
his O
late O
turnip O
seed O
on O
the O
hill O
field O
beyond O
the O
barn O
; O
and O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
sowing O
his O
on O
the O
big O
red O
brook O
field O
away O
over O
by O
Green O
Gables O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
knew O
that O
he O
ought O
because O
she O
had O
heard O
him O
tell O
Peter O
Morrison O
the O
evening O
before O
in O
William O
J. O
Blair O
’s O
store O
over O
at O
Carmody O
that O
he O
meant O
to O
sow O
his O
turnip O
seed O
the O
next O
afternoon O
. O
Peter O
had O
asked O
him O
, O
of O
course O
, O
for O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
had O
never O
been O
known O
to O
volunteer O
information O
about O
anything O
in O
his O
whole O
life O
. O
And O
yet O
here O
was O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
, O
at O
half-past O
three O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
a O
busy O
day O
, O
placidly O
driving O
over O
the O
hollow O
and O
up O
the O
hill O
; O
moreover O
, O
he O
wore O
a O
white O
collar O
and O
his O
best O
suit O
of O
clothes O
, O
which O
was O
plain O
proof O
that O
he O
was O
going O
out O
of O
Avonlea O
; O
and O
he O
had O
the O
buggy O
and O
the O
sorrel O
mare O
, O
which O
betokened O
that O
he O
was O
going O
a O
considerable O
distance O
. O
Now O
, O
where O
was O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
going O
and O
why O
was O
he O
going O
there O
? O
Had O
it O
been O
any O
other O
man O
in O
Avonlea O
, O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
, O
deftly O
putting O
this O
and O
that O
together O
, O
might O
have O
given O
a O
pretty O
good O
guess O
as O
to O
both O
questions O
. O
But O
Matthew O
so O
rarely O
went O
from O
home O
that O
it O
must O
be O
something O
pressing O
and O
unusual O
which O
was O
taking O
him O
; O
he O
was O
the O
shyest O
man O
alive O
and O
hated O
to O
have O
to O
go O
among O
strangers O
or O
to O
any O
place O
where O
he O
might O
have O
to O
talk O
. O
Matthew O
, O
dressed O
up O
with O
a O
white O
collar O
and O
driving O
in O
a O
buggy O
, O
was O
something O
that O
did O
n’t O
happen O
often O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
, O
ponder O
as O
she O
might O
, O
could O
make O
nothing O
of O
it O
and O
her O
afternoon O
’s O
enjoyment O
was O
spoiled O
. O
" O
I O
’ll O
just O
step O
over O
to O
Green O
Gables O
after O
tea O
and O
find O
out O
from O
Marilla O
where O
he O
’s O
gone O
and O
why O
, O
" O
the O
worthy O
woman O
finally O
concluded O
. O
" O
He O
does O
n’t O
generally O
go O
to O
town O
this O
time O
of O
year O
and O
he O
_ O
never O
_ O
visits O
; O
if O
he O
’d O
run O
out O
of O
turnip O
seed O
he O
would O
n’t O
dress O
up O
and O
take O
the O
buggy O
to O
go O
for O
more O
; O
he O
was O
n’t O
driving O
fast O
enough O
to O
be O
going O
for O
a O
doctor O
. O
Yet O
something O
must O
have O
happened O
since O
last O
night O
to O
start O
him O
off O
. O
I O
’m O
clean O
puzzled O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
, O
and O
I O
wo O
n’t O
know O
a O
minute O
’s O
peace O
of O
mind O
or O
conscience O
until O
I O
know O
what O
has O
taken O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
out O
of O
Avonlea O
today O
. O
" O
Accordingly O
after O
tea O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
set O
out O
; O
she O
had O
not O
far O
to O
go O
; O
the O
big O
, O
rambling O
, O
orchard-embowered O
house O
where O
the O
Cuthberts O
lived O
was O
a O
scant O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
up O
the O
road O
from O
Lynde O
’s O
Hollow O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
long O
lane O
made O
it O
a O
good O
deal O
further O
. O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
’s O
father O
, O
as O
shy O
and O
silent O
as O
his O
son O
after O
him O
, O
had O
got O
as O
far O
away O
as O
he O
possibly O
could O
from O
his O
fellow O
men O
without O
actually O
retreating O
into O
the O
woods O
when O
he O
founded O
his O
homestead O
. O
Green O
Gables O
was O
built O
at O
the O
furthest O
edge O
of O
his O
cleared O
land O
and O
there O
it O
was O
to O
this O
day O
, O
barely O
visible O
from O
the O
main O
road O
along O
which O
all O
the O
other O
Avonlea O
houses O
were O
so O
sociably O
situated O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
Lynde O
did O
not O
call O
living O
in O
such O
a O
place O
_ O
living O
_ O
at O
all O
. O
" O
It O
’s O
just O
_ O
staying O
_ O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
, O
" O
she O
said O
as O
she O
stepped O
along O
the O
deep-rutted O
, O
grassy O
lane O
bordered O
with O
wild O
rose O
bushes O
. O
" O
It O
’s O
no O
wonder O
Matthew O
and O
Marilla O
are O
both O
a O
little O
odd O
, O
living O
away O
back O
here O
by O
themselves O
. O
Trees O
are O
n’t O
much O
company O
, O
though O
dear O
knows O
if O
they O
were O
there O
’d O
be O
enough O
of O
them O
. O
I O
’d O
ruther O
look O
at O
people O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
they O
seem O
contented O
enough O
; O
but O
then O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
they O
’re O
used O
to O
it O
. O
A O
body O
can O
get O
used O
to O
anything O
, O
even O
to O
being O
hanged O
, O
as O
the O
Irishman O
said O
. O
" O
With O
this O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
lane O
into O
the O
backyard O
of O
Green O
Gables O
. O
Very O
green O
and O
neat O
and O
precise O
was O
that O
yard O
, O
set O
about O
on O
one O
side O
with O
great O
patriarchal O
willows O
and O
the O
other O
with O
prim O
Lombardies O
. O
Not O
a O
stray O
stick O
nor O
stone O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
would O
have O
seen O
it O
if O
there O
had O
been O
. O
Privately O
she O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
Marilla O
Cuthbert O
swept O
that O
yard O
over O
as O
often O
as O
she O
swept O
her O
house O
. O
One O
could O
have O
eaten O
a O
meal O
off O
the O
ground O
without O
over-brimming O
the O
proverbial O
peck O
of O
dirt O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
rapped O
smartly O
at O
the O
kitchen O
door O
and O
stepped O
in O
when O
bidden O
to O
do O
so O
. O
The O
kitchen O
at O
Green O
Gables O
was O
a O
cheerful O
apartment O
-- O
or O
would O
have O
been O
cheerful O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
so O
painfully O
clean O
as O
to O
give O
it O
something O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
an O
unused O
parlor O
. O
Its O
windows O
looked O
east O
and O
west O
; O
through O
the O
west O
one O
, O
looking O
out O
on O
the O
back O
yard O
, O
came O
a O
flood O
of O
mellow O
June O
sunlight O
; O
but O
the O
east O
one O
, O
whence O
you O
got O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
bloom O
white O
cherry-trees O
in O
the O
left O
orchard O
and O
nodding O
, O
slender O
birches O
down O
in O
the O
hollow O
by O
the O
brook O
, O
was O
greened O
over O
by O
a O
tangle O
of O
vines O
. O
Here O
sat O
Marilla O
Cuthbert O
, O
when O
she O
sat O
at O
all O
, O
always O
slightly O
distrustful O
of O
sunshine O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
her O
too O
dancing O
and O
irresponsible O
a O
thing O
for O
a O
world O
which O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
taken O
seriously O
; O
and O
here O
she O
sat O
now O
, O
knitting O
, O
and O
the O
table O
behind O
her O
was O
laid O
for O
supper O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
, O
before O
she O
had O
fairly O
closed O
the O
door O
, O
had O
taken O
a O
mental O
note O
of O
everything O
that O
was O
on O
that O
table O
. O
There O
were O
three O
plates O
laid O
, O
so O
that O
Marilla O
must O
be O
expecting O
some O
one O
home O
with O
Matthew O
to O
tea O
; O
but O
the O
dishes O
were O
everyday O
dishes O
and O
there O
was O
only O
crab-apple O
preserves O
and O
one O
kind O
of O
cake O
, O
so O
that O
the O
expected O
company O
could O
not O
be O
any O
particular O
company O
. O
Yet O
what O
of O
Matthew O
’s O
white O
collar O
and O
the O
sorrel O
mare O
? O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
was O
getting O
fairly O
dizzy O
with O
this O
unusual O
mystery O
about O
quiet O
, O
unmysterious O
Green O
Gables O
. O
" O
Good O
evening O
, O
Rachel O
, O
" O
Marilla O
said O
briskly O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
real O
fine O
evening O
, O
is O
n’t O
it O
? O
Wo O
n’t O
you O
sit O
down O
? O
How O
are O
all O
your O
folks O
? O
" O
Something O
that O
for O
lack O
of O
any O
other O
name O
might O
be O
called O
friendship O
existed O
and O
always O
had O
existed O
between O
Marilla O
Cuthbert O
and O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
because O
of O
-- O
their O
dissimilarity O
. O
Marilla O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
thin O
woman O
, O
with O
angles O
and O
without O
curves O
; O
her O
dark O
hair O
showed O
some O
gray O
streaks O
and O
was O
always O
twisted O
up O
in O
a O
hard O
little O
knot O
behind O
with O
two O
wire O
hairpins O
stuck O
aggressively O
through O
it O
. O
She O
looked O
like O
a O
woman O
of O
narrow O
experience O
and O
rigid O
conscience O
, O
which O
she O
was O
; O
but O
there O
was O
a O
saving O
something O
about O
her O
mouth O
which O
, O
if O
it O
had O
been O
ever O
so O
slightly O
developed O
, O
might O
have O
been O
considered O
indicative O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O
" O
We O
’re O
all O
pretty O
well O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
. O
" O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
afraid O
_ O
you O
_ O
were O
n’t O
, O
though O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
Matthew O
starting O
off O
today O
. O
I O
thought O
maybe O
he O
was O
going O
to O
the O
doctor O
’s O
. O
" O
Marilla O
’s O
lips O
twitched O
understandingly O
. O
She O
had O
expected O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
up O
; O
she O
had O
known O
that O
the O
sight O
of O
Matthew O
jaunting O
off O
so O
unaccountably O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
her O
neighbor O
’s O
curiosity O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
, O
I O
’m O
quite O
well O
although O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
headache O
yesterday O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
Matthew O
went O
to O
Bright O
River O
. O
We O
’re O
getting O
a O
little O
boy O
from O
an O
orphan O
asylum O
in O
Nova O
Scotia O
and O
he O
’s O
coming O
on O
the O
train O
tonight O
. O
" O
If O
Marilla O
had O
said O
that O
Matthew O
had O
gone O
to O
Bright O
River O
to O
meet O
a O
kangaroo O
from O
Australia O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
astonished O
. O
She O
was O
actually O
stricken O
dumb O
for O
five O
seconds O
. O
It O
was O
unsupposable O
that O
Marilla O
was O
making O
fun O
of O
her O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
was O
almost O
forced O
to O
suppose O
it O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
in O
earnest O
, O
Marilla O
? O
" O
she O
demanded O
when O
voice O
returned O
to O
her O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
" O
said O
Marilla O
, O
as O
if O
getting O
boys O
from O
orphan O
asylums O
in O
Nova O
Scotia O
were O
part O
of O
the O
usual O
spring O
work O
on O
any O
well-regulated O
Avonlea O
farm O
instead O
of O
being O
an O
unheard O
of O
innovation O
. O
Mrs. O
Rachel O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
received O
a O
severe O
mental O
jolt O
. O
She O
thought O
in O
exclamation O
points O
. O
A O
boy O
! O
Marilla O
and O
Matthew O
Cuthbert O
of O
all O
people O
adopting O
a O
boy O
! O
From O
an O
orphan O
asylum O
! O
Well O
, O
the O
world O
was O
certainly O
turning O
upside O
down O
! O
She O
would O
be O
surprised O
at O
nothing O
after O
this O

Nothing O

the O

a NOM_PER

out NOM_PER

about NOM_PER

, NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
few NOM_PER
years NOM_PER
after NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
Civil NOM_PER

started NOM_PER
down NOM_PER

toward NOM_PER
the NOM_PER

. O
Arriving O
at O
the O
town O
late O
the O
previous O
evening O
, O
he PRON_PER
had O
been O
driven O
up O
from O
the O
steamboat O
in O
a O
carriage O
, O
from O
which O
he PRON_PER
had O
been O
able O
to O
distinguish O
only O
the O
shadowy O
outlines O
of O
the O
houses O
along O
the O
street O
; O
so O
that O
this O
morning O
walk O
was O
his PRON_PER
first O
opportunity O
to O
see O
the O
town O
by O
daylight O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
suit O
of O
linen O
duck O
-- O
the O
day O
was O
warm O
-- O
a O
panama O
straw O
hat O
, O
and O
patent O
leather O
shoes O
. O
In O
appearance O
he PRON_PER
was O
tall O
, O
dark O
, O
with O
straight O
, O
black O
, O
lustrous O
hair O
, O
and O
very O
clean-cut O
, O
high-bred O
features O
. O
When O
he PRON_PER
paused O
by O
the NOM_PER
clerk NOM_PER
's O
desk O
on O
his PRON_PER
way O
out O
, O
to O
light O
his PRON_PER
cigar O
, O
the NOM_PER
day NOM_PER
clerk NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
just NOM_PER
come NOM_PER
on NOM_PER
duty NOM_PER
, O
glanced O
at O
the O
register O
and O
read O
the O

The NOM_PER
gentleman NOM_PER
from NOM_PER
South NOM_PER
Carolina NOM_PER
, O
walking O
down O
the O
street O
, O
glanced O
about O
him PRON_PER
with O
an O
eager O
look O
, O
in O
which O
curiosity O
and O
affection O
were O
mingled O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
bitterness O
. O
He PRON_PER
saw O
little O
that O
was O
not O
familiar O
, O
or O
that O
he PRON_PER
had O
not O
seen O
in O
his PRON_PER
dreams O
a O
hundred O
times O
during O
the O
past O
ten O
years O
. O
There O
had O
been O
some O
changes O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
some O
melancholy O
changes O
, O
but O
scarcely O
anything O
by O
way O
of O
addition O
or O
improvement O
to O
counterbalance O
them O
. O
Here O
and O
there O
blackened O
and O
dismantled O
walls O
marked O
the O
place O
where O
handsome O
buildings O
once O
had O
stood O
, O
for O
Sherman PROP_PER
's O
march O
to O
the O
sea O
had O
left O
its O
mark O
upon O
the O
town O
. O
The O
stores O
were O
mostly O
of O
brick O
, O
two O
stories O
high O
, O
joining O
one O
another O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
cities O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
names O
on O
the O
signs O
were O
familiar O
; O
others O
, O
including O
a O
number O
of O
Jewish O
names O
, O
were O
quite O
unknown O
to O
him PRON_PER
. O
A O
two O
minutes O
' O
walk O
brought O
Warwick PROP_PER
-- O
the O
name O
he PRON_PER
had O
registered O
under O
, O
and O
as O
we PRON_PER
shall O
call O
him PRON_PER
-- O
to O
the O
market-house O
, O
the O
central O
feature O
of O
Patesville O
, O
from O
both O
the O
commercial O
and O
the O
picturesque O
points O
of O
view O
. O
Standing O
foursquare O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
town O
, O
at O
the O
intersection O
of O
the O
two O
main O
streets O
, O
a O
" O
jog O
" O
at O
each O
street O
corner O
left O
around O
the O
market-house O
a O
little O
public O
square O
, O
which O
at O
this O
hour O
was O
well O
occupied O
by O
carts O
and O
wagons O
from O
the O
country O
and O
empty O
drays O
awaiting O
hire O
. O
Warwick PROP_PER
was O
unable O
to O
perceive O
much O
change O
in O
the O
market-house O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
red O
brick O
, O
long O
unpainted O
, O
had O
scaled O
off O
a O
little O
more O
here O
and O
there O
. O
There O
might O
have O
been O
a O
slight O
accretion O
of O
the O
moss O
and O
lichen O
on O
the O
shingled O
roof O
. O
But O
the O
tall O
tower O
, O
with O
its O
four-faced O
clock O
, O
rose O
as O
majestically O
and O
uncompromisingly O
as O
though O
the O
land O
had O
never O
been O
subjugated O
. O
Was O
it O
so O
irreconcilable O
, O
Warwick PROP_PER
wondered O
, O
as O
still O
to O
peal O
out O
the O
curfew O
bell O
, O
which O
at O
nine O
o'clock O
at O
night O
had O
clamorously O
warned O
all NOM_PER
negroes NOM_PER
, O
slave O
or O
free O
, O
that O
it O
was O
unlawful O
for O
them PRON_PER
to O
be O
abroad O
after O
that O
hour O
, O
under O
penalty O
of O
imprisonment O
or O
whipping O
? O
Was O
the NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
constable NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
whose NOM_PER
chief NOM_PER
business NOM_PER
it NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
been NOM_PER
to NOM_PER
ring NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
bell NOM_PER
, O
still O
alive O
and O
exercising O
the O
functions O
of O
his PRON_PER
office O
, O
and O
had O
age O
lessened O
or O
increased O
the O
number O
of O
times O
that O
obliging NOM_PER
citizens NOM_PER
performed O
this O
duty O
for O
him PRON_PER
during O
his PRON_PER
temporary O
absences O
in O
the O
company O
of O
convivial NOM_PER
spirits NOM_PER
? O
A O
few O
moments O
later O
, O
Warwick PROP_PER
saw O
a NOM_PER
colored NOM_PER
policeman NOM_PER
in O
the NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
constable NOM_PER
's O
place O
-- O
a O
stronger O
reminder O
than O
even O
the O
burned O
buildings O
that O
war O
had O
left O
its O
mark O
upon O
the O
old O
town O
, O
with O
which O
Time O
had O
dealt O
so O
tenderly O
. O
The O
lower O
story O
of O
the O
market-house O
was O
open O
on O
all O
four O
of O
its O
sides O
to O
the O
public O
square O
. O
Warwick PROP_PER
passed O
through O
one O
of O
the O
wide O
brick O
arches O
and O
traversed O
the O
building O
with O
a O
leisurely O
step O
. O
He PRON_PER
looked O
in O
vain O
into O
the O
stalls O
for O
the NOM_PER
butcher NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
sold NOM_PER
fresh NOM_PER
meat NOM_PER
twice NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
week NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
on NOM_PER
market NOM_PER
days NOM_PER
, O
and O
he PRON_PER
felt O
a O
genuine O
thrill O
of O
pleasure O
when O
he PRON_PER
recognized O
the O
red O
bandana O
turban O
of O
old PROP_PER
Aunt PROP_PER
Lyddy PROP_PER
, O
the NOM_PER
ancient NOM_PER
negro NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
sold NOM_PER
him NOM_PER
gingerbread NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
fried NOM_PER
fish NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
told NOM_PER
him NOM_PER
weird NOM_PER
tales NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
witchcraft NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
conjuration NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
days NOM_PER
when NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
as NOM_PER
an NOM_PER
idle NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
he NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
loafed NOM_PER
about NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
market-house NOM_PER
. O
He O
did O
not O
speak O
to O
her O
, O
however O
, O
or O
give O
her O
any O
sign O
of O
recognition O
. O
He O
threw O
a O
glance O
toward O
a O
certain O
corner O
where O
steps O
led O
to O
the O
town O
hall O
above O
. O
On O
this O
stairway O
he O
had O
once O
seen O
a O
manacled O
free O
negro O
shot O
while O
being O
taken O
upstairs O
for O
examination O
under O
a O
criminal O
charge O
. O
Warwick O
recalled O
vividly O
how O
the O
shot O
had O
rung O
out O
. O
He O
could O
see O
again O
the O
livid O
look O
of O
terror O
on O
the O
victim O
's O
face O
, O
the O
gathering O
crowd O
, O
the O
resulting O
confusion O
. O
The O
murderer O
, O
he O
recalled O
, O
had O
been O
tried O
and O
sentenced O
to O
imprisonment O
for O
life O
, O
but O
was O
pardoned O
by O
a O
merciful O
governor O
after O
serving O
a O
year O
of O
his O
sentence O
. O
As O
Warwick O
was O
neither O
a O
prophet O
nor O
the O
son O
of O
a O
prophet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
foresee O
that O
, O
thirty O
years O
later O
, O
even O
this O
would O
seem O
an O
excessive O
punishment O
for O
so O
slight O
a O
misdemeanor O
. O
Leaving O
the O
market-house O
, O
Warwick O
turned O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
kept O
on O
his O
course O
until O
he O
reached O
the O
next O
corner O
. O
After O
another O
turn O
to O
the O
right O
, O
a O
dozen O
paces O
brought O
him O
in O
front O
of O
a O
small O
weather-beaten O
frame O
building O
, O
from O
which O
projected O
a O
wooden O
sign-board O
bearing O
the O
inscription O
: O
-- O
ARCHIBALD O
STRAIGHT O
, O
LAWYER O
. O
He O
turned O
the O
knob O
, O
but O
the O
door O
was O
locked O
. O
Retracing O
his O
steps O
past O
a O
vacant O
lot O
, O
the O
young O
man O
entered O
a O
shop O
where O
a O
colored O
man O
was O
employed O
in O
varnishing O
a O
coffin O
, O
which O
stood O
on O
two O
trestles O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
floor O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
impressed O
by O
the O
melancholy O
suggestiveness O
of O
his O
task O
, O
he O
was O
whistling O
a O
lively O
air O
with O
great O
gusto O
. O
Upon O
Warwick O
's O
entrance O
this O
effusion O
came O
to O
a O
sudden O
end O
, O
and O
the O
coffin-maker O
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
professional O
gravity O
. O
" O

he O
said O

lifting O

" O
Warwick O
left O
the O
undertaker O
's O
shop O
and O
retraced O
his O
steps O
until O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
lawyer O
's O
office O
, O
toward O
which O
he O
threw O
an O
affectionate O
glance O
. O
A O
few O
rods O
farther O
led O
him O
past O
the O
old O
black O
Presbyterian O
church O
, O
with O
its O
square O
tower O
, O
embowered O
in O
a O
stately O
grove O
; O
past O
the O
Catholic O
church O
, O
with O
its O
many O
crosses O
, O
and O
a O
painted O
wooden O
figure O
of O
St. O
James O
in O
a O
recess O
beneath O
the O
gable O
; O
and O
past O
the O
old O
Jefferson O
House O
, O
once O
the O
leading O
hotel O
of O
the O
town O
, O
in O
front O
of O
which O
political O
meetings O
had O
been O
held O
, O

political O
speeches O
made O

and O
political O
hard O
cider O
drunk O
, O
in O
the O
days O
of O

Tippecanoe O
and O

too O

" O
The O
street O
down O
which O
Warwick O
had O
come O
intersected O
Front O
Street O
at O
a O
sharp O
angle O
in O
front O
of O
the O
old O
hotel O
, O
forming O
a O
sort O
of O
flatiron O
block O
at O
the O
junction O
, O
known O
as O
Liberty O
Point O
, O
-- O
perhaps O
because O
slave O
auctions O
were O
sometimes O
held O
there O
in O
the O
good O
old O
days O
. O
Just O
before O
Warwick O
reached O
Liberty O
Point O
, O
a O
young O
woman O
came O
down O
Front O
Street O
from O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
market-house O
. O
When O
their O
paths O
converged O
, O
Warwick O
kept O
on O
down O
Front O
Street O
behind O
her O
, O
it O
having O
been O
already O
his O
intention O
to O
walk O
in O
this O
direction O
. O
Warwick O
's O
first O
glance O
had O
revealed O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
young O
woman O
was O
strikingly O
handsome O
, O
with O
a O
stately O
beauty O
seldom O
encountered O
. O
As O
he O
walked O
along O
behind O
her O
at O
a O
measured O
distance O
, O
he O
could O
not O
help O
noting O
the O
details O
that O
made O
up O
this O
pleasing O
impression O
, O
for O
his O
mind O
was O
singularly O
alive O
to O
beauty O
, O
in O
whatever O
embodiment O
. O
The O
girl O
's O
figure O
, O
he O
perceived O
, O
was O
admirably O
proportioned O
; O
she O
was O
evidently O
at O
the O
period O
when O
the O
angles O
of O
childhood O
were O
rounding O
into O
the O
promising O
curves O
of O
adolescence O
. O
Her O
abundant O
hair O
, O
of O
a O
dark O
and O
glossy O
brown O
, O
was O
neatly O
plaited O
and O
coiled O
above O
an O
ivory O
column O
that O
rose O
straight O
from O
a O
pair O
of O
gently O
sloping O
shoulders O
, O
clearly O
outlined O
beneath O
the O
light O
muslin O
frock O
that O
covered O
them O
. O
He O
could O
see O
that O
she O
was O
tastefully O
, O
though O
not O
richly O
, O
dressed O
, O
and O
that O
she O
walked O
with O
an O
elastic O
step O
that O
revealed O
a O
light O
heart O
and O
the O
vigor O

Cameron PROP_PER
-- O
a NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
's O
face O
. O
It O
was O
there O
in O
the O
white O
heart O
of O
the O
dying O
campfire O
; O
it O
hung O
in O
the O
shadows O
that O
hovered O
over O
the O
flickering O
light O
; O
it O
drifted O
in O
the O
darkness O
beyond O
. O
This O
hour O
, O
when O
the O
day O
had O
closed O
and O
the O
lonely O
desert O
night O
set O
in O
with O
its O
dead O
silence O
, O
was O
one O
in O
which O
Cameron PROP_PER
's O
mind O
was O
thronged O
with O
memories O
of O
a O
time O
long O
past O
-- O
of O
a O
home O
back O
in O
Peoria O
, O
of O
a NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
he NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
wronged NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
lost NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
loved NOM_PER
too NOM_PER
late NOM_PER
. O
He O
was O
a O
prospector O
for O
gold O
, O
a O
hunter O
of O
solitude O
, O
a O
lover O
of O
the O
drear O
, O
rock-ribbed O
infinitude O
, O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
alone O
to O
remember O
. O
A O
sound O
disturbed O
Cameron O
's O
reflections O
. O
He O
bent O
his O
head O
listening O
. O
A O
soft O
wind O
fanned O
the O
paling O
embers O
, O
blew O
sparks O
and O
white O
ashes O
and O
thin O
smoke O
away O
into O
the O
enshrouding O
circle O
of O
blackness O
. O
His O
burro O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
moving O
about O
. O
The O
quiet O
split O
to O
the O
cry O
of O
a O
coyote O
. O
It O
rose O
strange O
, O
wild O
, O
mournful O
-- O
not O
the O
howl O
of O
a O
prowling O
upland O
beast O
baying O
the O
campfire O
or O
barking O
at O
a O
lonely O
prospector O
, O
but O
the O
wail O
of O
a O
wolf O
, O
full-voiced O
, O
crying O
out O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
desert O
and O
the O
night O
. O
Hunger O
throbbed O
in O
it O
-- O
hunger O
for O
a O
mate O
, O
for O
offspring O
, O
for O
life O
. O
When O
it O
ceased O
, O
the O
terrible O
desert O
silence O
smote O
Cameron O
, O
and O
the O
cry O
echoed O
in O
his O
soul O
. O
He O
and O
that O
wandering O
wolf O
were O
brothers O
. O
Then O
a O
sharp O
clink O
of O
metal O
on O
stone O
and O
soft O
pads O
of O
hoofs O
in O
sand O
prompted O
Cameron O
to O
reach O
for O
his O
gun O
, O
and O
to O
move O
out O
of O
the O
light O
of O
the O
waning O
campfire O
. O
He O
was O
somewhere O
along O
the O
wild O
border O
line O
between O
Sonora O
and O
Arizona O
; O
and O
the O
prospector O
who O
dared O
the O
heat O
and O
barrenness O
of O
that O
region O
risked O
other O
dangers O
sometimes O
as O
menacing O
. O
Figures O
darker O
than O
the O
gloom O
approached O
and O
took O
shape O
, O
and O
in O
the O
light O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
those O
of O
a O
white O
man O
and O
a O
heavily O
packed O
burro O
. O
" O
Hello O
there O
, O
" O
the O
man O
called O
, O
as O
he O
came O
to O
a O
halt O
and O
gazed O
about O
him O
. O
" O
I O
saw O
your O
fire O
. O
May O
I O
make O
camp O
here O
? O
" O
Cameron O
came O
forth O
out O
of O
the O
shadow O
and O
greeted O
his O
visitor O
, O
whom O
he O
took O
for O
a O
prospector O
like O
himself O
. O
Cameron O
resented O
the O
breaking O
of O
his O
lonely O
campfire O
vigil O
, O
but O
he O
respected O
the O
law O
of O
the O
desert O
. O
The O
stranger O
thanked O
him O
, O
and O
then O
slipped O
the O
pack O
from O
his O
burro O
. O
Then O
he O
rolled O
out O
his O
pack O
and O
began O
preparations O
for O
a O
meal O
. O
His O
movements O
were O
slow O
and O
methodical O
. O
Cameron O
watched O
him O
, O
still O
with O
resentment O
, O
yet O
with O
a O
curious O
and O
growing O
interest O
. O
The O
campfire O
burst O
into O
a O
bright O
blaze O
, O
and O
by O
its O
light O
Cameron O
saw O
a O
man O
whose O
gray O
hair O
somehow O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
make O
him O
old O
, O
and O
whose O
stooped O
shoulders O
did O
not O
detract O
from O
an O
impression O
of O
rugged O
strength O
. O
" O
Find O
any O
mineral O
? O
" O
asked O
Cameron O
, O
presently O
. O
His O
visitor O
looked O
up O
quickly O
, O
as O
if O
startled O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
human O
voice O
. O
He O
replied O
, O
and O
then O
the O
two O
men O
talked O
a O
little O
. O
But O
the O
stranger O
evidently O
preferred O
silence O
. O
Cameron O
understood O
that O
. O
He O
laughed O
grimly O
and O
bent O
a O
keener O
gaze O
upon O
the O
furrowed O
, O
shadowy O
face O
. O
Another O
of O
those O
strange O
desert O
prospectors O
in O
whom O
there O
was O
some O
relentless O
driving O
power O
besides O
the O
lust O
for O
gold O
! O
Cameron O
felt O
that O
between O
this O
man O
and O
himself O
there O
was O
a O
subtle O
affinity O
, O
vague O
and O
undefined O
, O
perhaps O
born O
of O
the O
divination O
that O
here O
was O
a O
desert O
wanderer O
like O
himself O
, O
perhaps O
born O
of O
a O
deeper O
, O
an O
unintelligible O
relation O
having O
its O
roots O
back O
in O
the O
past O
. O
A O
long-forgotten O
sensation O
stirred O
in O
Cameron O
's O
breast O
, O
one O
so O
long O
forgotten O
that O
he O
could O
not O
recognize O
it O
. O
But O
it O
was O
akin O
to O
pain O
. O
II O
When O
he O
awakened O
he O
found O
, O
to O
his O
surprise O
, O
that O
his O
companion O
had O
departed O
. O
A O
trail O
in O
the O
sand O
led O
off O
to O
the O
north O
. O
There O
was O
no O
water O
in O
that O
direction O
. O
Cameron O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
; O
it O
was O
not O
his O
affair O
; O
he O
had O
his O
own O
problems O
. O
And O
straightway O
he O
forgot O
his O
strange O
visitor O
. O
Cameron O
began O
his O
day O
, O
grateful O
for O
the O
solitude O
that O
was O
now O
unbroken O
, O
for O
the O
canyon-furrowed O
and O
cactus-spired O
scene O
that O
now O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
life O
. O
He O
traveled O
southwest O
, O
never O
straying O
far O
from O
the O
dry O
stream O
bed O
; O
and O
in O
a O
desultory O
way O
, O
without O
eagerness O
, O
he O
hunted O
for O
signs O
of O
gold O
. O
The O
work O
was O
toilsome O
, O
yet O
the O
periods O
of O
rest O
in O
which O
he O
indulged O
were O
not O
taken O
because O
of O
fatigue O
. O
He O
rested O
to O
look O
, O
to O
listen O
, O
to O
feel O
. O
What O
the O
vast O
silent O
world O
meant O
to O
him O
had O
always O
been O
a O
mystical O
thing O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
in O
all O
its O
incalculable O
power O
, O
but O
never O
understood O
. O
That O
day O
, O
while O
it O
was O
yet O
light O
, O
and O
he O
was O
digging O
in O
a O
moist O
white-bordered O
wash O
for O
water O
, O
he O
was O
brought O
sharply O
up O
by O
hearing O
the O
crack O
of O
hard O
hoofs O
on O
stone O
. O
There O
down O
the O
canyon O
came O
a O
man O
and O
a O
burro O
. O
Cameron O
recognized O
them O
. O
" O
Hello O
, O
friend O
, O
" O
called O
the O
man O
, O
halting O
. O
" O
Our O
trails O
crossed O
again O
. O
That O
's O
good O
. O
" O
" O
Hello O
, O
" O
replied O
Cameron O
, O
slowly O
. O
" O
Any O
mineral O
sign O
to-day O
? O
" O
" O
No O
. O
" O
They O
made O
camp O
together O
, O
ate O
their O
frugal O
meal O
, O
smoked O
a O
pipe O
, O
and O
rolled O
in O
their O
blankets O
without O
exchanging O
many O
words O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
the O
same O
reticence O
, O
the O
same O
aloofness O
characterized O
the O
manner O
of O
both O
. O
But O
Cameron O
's O
companion O
, O
when O
he O
had O
packed O
his O
burro O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
start O
, O
faced O
about O
and O
said O
: O
" O
We O
might O
stay O
together O
, O
if O
it O
's O
all O
right O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
take O
a O
partner O
, O
" O
replied O
Cameron O
. O
" O
You O
're O
alone O
; O
I O
'm O
alone O
, O
" O
said O
the O
other O
, O
mildly O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a O
big O
place O
. O
If O
we O
find O
gold O
there O
'll O
be O
enough O
for O
two O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
go O
down O
into O
the O
desert O
for O
gold O
alone O
, O
" O
rejoined O
Cameron O
, O
with O
a O
chill O
note O
in O
his O
swift O
reply O
. O
His O
companion O
's O
deep-set O
, O
luminous O
eyes O
emitted O
a O
singular O
flash O
. O
It O
moved O
Cameron O
to O
say O
that O
in O
the O
years O
of O
his O
wandering O
he O
had O
met O
no O
man O
who O
could O
endure O
equally O
with O
him O
the O
blasting O
heat O
, O
the O
blinding O
dust O
storms O
, O
the O
wilderness O
of O
sand O
and O
rock O
and O
lava O
and O
cactus O
, O
the O
terrible O
silence O
and O
desolation O
of O
the O
desert O
. O
Cameron O
waved O
a O
hand O
toward O
the O
wide O
, O
shimmering O
, O
shadowy O
descent O
of O
plain O
and O
range O
. O
" O
I O
may O
strike O
through O
the O
Sonora O
Desert O
. O
I O
may O
head O
for O
Pinacate O
or O
north O
for O
the O
Colorado O
Basin O
. O
You O
are O
an O
old O
man O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
country O
, O
but O
to O
me O
one O
place O
is O
the O
same O
as O
another O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
companion O
. O
For O
moments O
he O
seemed O
to O
forget O
himself O
, O
and O
swept O
his O
far-reaching O
gaze O
out O
over O
the O
colored O
gulf O
of O
stone O
and O
sand O
. O
Then O
with O
gentle O
slaps O
he O
drove O
his O
burro O
in O
behind O
Cameron O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
'm O
old O
. O
I O
'm O
lonely O
, O
too O
. O
It O
's O
come O
to O
me O
just O
lately O
. O
But O
, O
friend O
, O
I O
can O
still O
travel O
, O
and O
for O
a O
few O
days O
my O
company O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Have O
it O
your O
way O
, O
" O
said O
Cameron O
. O
They O
began O
a O
slow O
march O
down O
into O
the O
desert O
. O
At O
sunset O
they O
camped O
under O
the O
lee O
of O
a O
low O
mesa O
. O
Cameron O
was O
glad O
his O
comrade O
had O
the O
Indian O
habit O
of O
silence O
. O
Another O
day O
's O
travel O
found O
the O
prospectors O
deep O
in O
the O
wilderness O
. O
Then O
there O
came O
a O
breaking O
of O
reserve O
, O
noticeable O
in O
the O
elder O
man O
, O
almost O
imperceptibly O
gradual O
in O
Cameron O
. O
Beside O
the O
meager O
mesquite O
campfire O
this O
gray-faced O
, O
thoughtful O
old O
prospector O
would O
remove O
his O
black O
pipe O
from O
his O
mouth O
to O
talk O
a O
little O
; O
and O
Cameron O
would O
listen O
, O
and O
sometimes O
unlock O
his O
lips O
to O
speak O
a O
word O
. O
And O
so O
, O
as O
Cameron O
began O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
desert O
less O
lonely O
than O
habitual O
, O
he O
began O
to O
take O
keener O
note O
of O
his O
comrade O
, O
and O
found O
him O
different O
from O
any O
other O
he O
had O
ever O
encountered O
in O
the O
wilderness O
. O
This O
man O
never O
grumbled O
at O
the O
heat O
, O
the O
glare O
, O
the O
driving O
sand O
, O
the O
sour O
water O
, O
the O
scant O
fare O
. O
During O
the O
daylight O
hours O
he O
was O
seldom O
idle O
. O
At O
night O
he O
sat O
dreaming O
before O
the O
fire O
or O
paced O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
gloom O
. O
He O
slept O
but O
little O
, O
and O
that O
long O
after O
Cameron O
had O
had O
his O
own O
rest O
. O
He O
was O
tireless O
, O
patient O
, O
brooding O
. O
Cameron O
's O
awakened O
interest O
brought O
home O
to O
him O
the O
realization O
that O
for O
years O
he O
had O
shunned O
companionship O
. O
In O
those O
years O
only O
three O
men O
had O
wandered O
into O
the O
desert O
with O
him O
, O
and O
these O
had O
left O
their O
bones O
to O
bleach O
in O
the O
shifting O
sands O
. O
Cameron O
had O
not O
cared O
to O
know O
their O
secrets O
. O
But O
the O
more O
he O
studied O
this O
latest O
comrade O
the O
more O
he O
began O
to O
suspect O
that O
he O
might O
have O
missed O
something O
in O
the O
others O
. O
In O
his O
own O
driving O
passion O
to O
take O
his O
secret O
into O
the O
limitless O
abode O
of O
silence O
and O
desolation O
, O
where O
he O
could O
be O
alone O
with O
it O
, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
that O
life O
dealt O
shocks O
to O
other O
men O
. O
Somehow O
this O
silent O
comrade O
reminded O
him O
. O
One O
afternoon O
late O
, O
after O
they O
had O
toiled O
up O
a O
white O
, O
winding O
wash O
of O
sand O
and O
gravel O
, O
they O
came O
upon O
a O
dry O
waterhole O
. O
Cameron O
dug O
deep O
into O
the O
sand O
, O
but O
without O
avail O
. O
He O
was O
turning O
to O
retrace O
weary O
steps O
back O
to O
the O
last O
water O
when O
his O
comrade O
asked O
him O
to O
wait O
. O
Cameron O
watched O
him O
search O
in O
his O
pack O
and O
bring O
forth O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
small O
, O
forked O
branch O
of O
a O
peach O
tree O
. O
He O
grasped O
the O
prongs O
of O
the O
fork O
and O
held O
them O
before O
him O
with O
the O
end O
standing O
straight O
out O
, O
and O
then O
he O
began O
to O
walk O
along O
the O
stream O
bed O
. O
Cameron O
, O
at O
first O
amused O
, O
then O
amazed O
, O
then O
pitying O
, O
and O
at O
last O
curious O
, O
kept O
pace O
with O
the O
prospector O
. O
He O
saw O
a O
strong O
tension O
of O
his O
comrade O
's O
wrists O
, O
as O
if O
he O
was O
holding O
hard O
against O
a O
considerable O
force O
. O
The O
end O
of O
the O
peach O
branch O
began O
to O
quiver O
and O
turn O
. O
Cameron O
reached O
out O
a O
hand O
to O
touch O
it O
, O
and O
was O
astounded O
at O
feeling O
a O
powerful O
vibrant O
force O
pulling O
the O
branch O
downward O
. O
He O
felt O
it O
as O
a O
magnetic O
shock O
. O
The O
branch O
kept O
turning O
, O
and O
at O
length O
pointed O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
Dig O
here O
, O
" O
said O
the O
prospector O
. O
" O
What O
! O
" O
ejaculated O
Cameron O
. O
Had O
the O
man O
lost O
his O
mind O
? O
Then O
Cameron O
stood O
by O
while O
his O
comrade O
dug O
in O
the O
sand O
. O
Three O
feet O
he O
dug O
-- O
four O
-- O
five O
, O
and O
the O
sand O
grew O
dark O
, O
then O
moist O
. O
At O
six O
feet O
water O
began O
to O
seep O
through O
. O
" O
Get O
the O
little O
basket O
in O
my O
pack O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
Cameron O
complied O
, O
and O
saw O
his O
comrade O
drop O
the O
basket O
into O

CHAPTER O
ONE O
PLAYING O
PILGRIMS NOM_PER
" O
Christmas O
wo O
n't O
be O
Christmas O
without O
any O
presents O
, O
" O
grumbled O
Jo PROP_PER
, O
lying O
on O
the O
rug O
. O
" O
It O
's O
so O
dreadful O
to O
be O
poor O
! O
" O
sighed O
Meg PROP_PER
, O
looking O
down O
at O
her PRON_PER
old O
dress O
. O
" O
I PRON_PER
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
fair O
for O
some NOM_PER
girls NOM_PER
to O
have O
plenty O
of O
pretty O
things O
, O
and O
other NOM_PER
girls NOM_PER
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
" O
added O
little PROP_PER
Amy PROP_PER
, O
with O
an O
injured O
sniff O
. O
" O
We PRON_PER
've O
got O
Father NOM_PER
and O
Mother NOM_PER
, O
and O
each NOM_PER
other NOM_PER
, O
" O
said O
Beth PROP_PER
contentedly O
from O
her PRON_PER
corner O
. O
The NOM_PER
four NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
faces NOM_PER
on NOM_PER
which NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
firelight NOM_PER
shone NOM_PER
brightened O
at O
the O
cheerful O
words O
, O
but O
darkened O
again O
as O
Jo PROP_PER
said O
sadly O
, O
" O
We PRON_PER
have O
n't O
got O
Father NOM_PER
, O
and O
shall O
not O
have O
him PRON_PER
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
" O
She PRON_PER
did O
n't O
say O
" O
perhaps O
never O
, O
" O
but O
each O
silently O
added O
it O
, O
thinking O
of O
Father NOM_PER
far O
away O
, O
where O
the O
fighting O
was O
. O
Nobody NOM_PER
spoke O
for O
a O
minute O
; O
then O
Meg PROP_PER
said O
in O
an O
altered O
tone O
, O
" O
You PRON_PER
know O
the O
reason O
Mother NOM_PER
proposed O
not O
having O
any O
presents O
this O
Christmas O
was O
because O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
hard O
winter O
for O
everyone NOM_PER
; O
and O
she PRON_PER
thinks O
we PRON_PER
ought O
not O
to O
spend O
money O
for O
pleasure O
, O
when O
our NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
are O
suffering O
so O
in O
the O
army O
. O
We O
ca O
n't O
do O
much O
, O
but O
we O
can O
make O
our O
little O
sacrifices O
, O
and O
ought O
to O
do O
it O
gladly O
. O
But O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
" O
and O
Meg O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
regretfully O
of O
all O
the O
pretty O
things O
she O
wanted O
. O
" O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
little O
we O
should O
spend O
would O
do O
any O
good O
. O
We O
've O
each O
got O
a O
dollar O
, O
and O
the O
army O
would O
n't O
be O
much O
helped O
by O
our O
giving O
that O
. O
I O
agree O
not O
to O
expect O
anything O
from O
Mother O
or O
you O
, O
but O
I O
do O
want O
to O
buy O
_ O
Undine O
and O
Sintran O
_ O
for O
myself O
. O
I O
've O
wanted O
it O
so O
long O
, O
" O
said O
Jo O
, O
who O
was O
a O
bookworm O
. O
" O
I O
planned O
to O
spend O
mine O
in O
new O
music O
, O
" O
said O
Beth O
, O
with O
a O
little O
sigh O
, O
which O
no O
one O
heard O
but O
the O
hearth O
brush O
and O
kettle-holder O
. O
" O
I O
shall O
get O
a O
nice O
box O
of O
Faber O
's O
drawing O
pencils O
; O
I O
really O
need O
them O
, O
" O
said O
Amy O
decidedly O
. O
" O
Mother O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
our O
money O
, O
and O
she O
wo O
n't O
wish O
us O
to O
give O
up O
everything O
. O
Let O
's O
each O
buy O
what O
we O
want O
, O
and O
have O
a O
little O
fun O
; O
I O
'm O
sure O
we O
work O
hard O
enough O
to O
earn O
it O
, O
" O
cried O
Jo O
, O
examining O
the O
heels O
of O
her O
shoes O
in O
a O
gentlemanly O
manner O
. O
" O
I O
know O
I O
do O
-- O
teaching O
those O
tiresome O
children O
nearly O
all O
day O
, O
when O
I O
'm O
longing O
to O
enjoy O
myself O
at O
home O
, O
" O
began O
Meg O
, O
in O
the O
complaining O
tone O
again O
. O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
have O
half O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
as O
I O
do O
, O
" O
said O
Jo O
. O
" O
How O
would O
you O
like O
to O
be O
shut O
up O
for O
hours O
with O
a O
nervous O
, O
fussy O
old O
lady O
, O
who O
keeps O
you O
trotting O
, O
is O
never O
satisfied O
, O
and O
worries O
you O
till O
you O
're O
ready O
to O
fly O
out O
the O
window O
or O
cry O
? O
" O
" O
It O
's O
naughty O
to O
fret O
, O
but O
I O
do O
think O
washing O
dishes O
and O
keeping O
things O
tidy O
is O
the O
worst O
work O
in O
the O
world O
. O
It O
makes O
me O
cross O
, O
and O
my O
hands O
get O
so O
stiff O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
practice O
well O
at O
all O
. O
" O
And O
Beth O
looked O
at O
her O
rough O
hands O
with O
a O
sigh O
that O
any O
one O
could O
hear O
that O
time O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
any O
of O
you O
suffer O
as O
I O
do O
, O
" O
cried O
Amy O
, O
" O
for O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
to O
school O
with O
impertinent O
girls O
, O
who O
plague O
you O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
your O
lessons O
, O
and O
laugh O
at O
your O
dresses O
, O
and O
label O
your O
father O
if O
he O
is O
n't O
rich O
, O
and O
insult O
you O
when O
your O
nose O
is O
n't O
nice O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
mean O
libel O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
so O
, O
and O
not O
talk O
about O
labels O
, O
as O
if O
Papa O
was O
a O
pickle O
bottle O
, O
" O
advised O
Jo O
, O
laughing O
. O
" O
I O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
, O
and O
you O
need O
n't O
be O
statirical O
about O
it O
. O
It O
's O
proper O
to O
use O
good O
words O
, O
and O
improve O
your O
vocabilary O
, O
" O
returned O
Amy O
, O
with O
dignity O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
peck O
at O
one O
another O
, O
children O
. O
Do O
n't O
you O
wish O
we O
had O
the O
money O
Papa O
lost O
when O
we O
were O
little O
, O
Jo O
? O
Dear O
me O
! O
How O
happy O
and O
good O
we O
'd O
be O
, O
if O
we O
had O
no O
worries O
! O
" O
said O
Meg O
, O
who O
could O
remember O
better O
times O
. O
" O
You O
said O
the O
other O
day O
you O
thought O
we O
were O
a O
deal O
happier O
than O
the O
King O
children O
, O
for O
they O
were O
fighting O
and O
fretting O
all O
the O
time O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
money O
. O
" O
" O
So O
I O
did O
, O
Beth O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
we O
are O
. O
For O
though O
we O
do O
have O
to O
work O
, O
we O
make O
fun O
of O
ourselves O
, O
and O
are O
a O
pretty O
jolly O
set O
, O
as O
Jo O
would O
say O
. O
" O
" O
Jo O
does O
use O
such O
slang O
words O
! O
" O
observed O
Amy O
, O
with O
a O
reproving O
look O
at O
the O
long O
figure O
stretched O
on O
the O
rug O
. O
Jo O
immediately O
sat O
up O
, O
put O
her O
hands O
in O
her O
pockets O
, O
and O
began O
to O
whistle O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
, O
Jo O
. O
It O
's O
so O
boyish O
! O
" O
" O
That O
's O
why O
I O
do O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
detest O
rude O
, O
unladylike O
girls O
! O
" O
" O
I O
hate O
affected O
, O
niminy-piminy O
chits O
! O
" O
" O
Birds O
in O
their O
little O
nests O
agree O
, O
" O
sang O
Beth O
, O
the O
peacemaker O
, O
with O
such O
a O
funny O
face O
that O
both O
sharp O
voices O
softened O
to O
a O
laugh O
, O
and O
the O
" O
pecking O
" O
ended O
for O
that O
time O
. O
" O
Really O
, O
girls O
, O
you O
are O
both O
to O
be O
blamed O
, O
" O
said O
Meg O
, O
beginning O
to O
lecture O
in O
her O
elder-sisterly O
fashion O
. O
" O
You O
are O
old O
enough O
to O
leave O
off O
boyish O
tricks O
, O
and O
to O
behave O
better O
, O
Josephine O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
matter O
so O
much O
when O
you O
were O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
but O
now O
you O
are O
so O
tall O
, O
and O
turn O
up O
your O
hair O
, O
you O
should O
remember O
that O
you O
are O
a O
young O
lady O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'm O
not O
! O
And O
if O
turning O
up O
my O
hair O
makes O
me O
one O
, O
I O
'll O
wear O
it O
in O
two O
tails O
till O
I O
'm O
twenty O
, O
" O
cried O
Jo O
, O
pulling O
off O
her O
net O
, O
and O
shaking O
down O
a O
chestnut O
mane O
. O
" O
I O
hate O
to O
think O
I O
've O
got O
to O
grow O
up O
, O
and O
be O
Miss O
March O
, O
and O
wear O
long O
gowns O
, O
and O
look O
as O
prim O
as O
a O
China O
Aster O
! O
It O
's O
bad O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
girl O
, O
anyway O
, O
when O
I O
like O
boy O
's O
games O
and O
work O
and O
manners O
! O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
over O
my O
disappointment O
in O
not O
being O
a O
boy O
. O
And O
it O
's O
worse O
than O
ever O
now O
, O
for O
I O
'm O
dying O
to O
go O
and O
fight O
with O
Papa O
. O
And O
I O
can O
only O
stay O
home O
and O
knit O
, O
like O
a O
poky O
old O
woman O
! O
" O
And O
Jo O
shook O
the O
blue O
army O
sock O
till O
the O
needles O
rattled O
like O
castanets O
, O
and O
her O
ball O
bounded O
across O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Poor O
Jo O
! O
It O
's O
too O
bad O
, O
but O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O
So O
you O
must O
try O
to O
be O
contented O
with O
making O
your O
name O
boyish O
, O
and O
playing O
brother O
to O
us O
girls O
, O
" O
said O
Beth O
, O
stroking O
the O
rough O
head O
with O
a O
hand O
that O
all O
the O
dish O
washing O
and O
dusting O
in O
the O
world O
could O
not O
make O
ungentle O
in O
its O
touch O
. O
" O
As O
for O
you O
, O
Amy O
, O
" O
continued O
Meg O
, O
" O
you O
are O
altogether O
too O
particular O
and O
prim O
. O
Your O
airs O
are O
funny O
now O
, O
but O
you O
'll O
grow O
up O
an O
affected O
little O
goose O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
take O
care O
. O
I O
like O
your O
nice O
manners O
and O
refined O
ways O
of O
speaking O
, O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
be O
elegant O
. O
But O
your O
absurd O
words O
are O
as O
bad O
as O
Jo O
's O
slang O
. O
" O
" O
If O
Jo O
is O
a O
tomboy O
and O
Amy O
a O
goose O
, O
what O
am O
I O
, O
please O
? O
" O
asked O
Beth O
, O
ready O
to O
share O
the O
lecture O
. O
" O
You O
're O
a O
dear O
, O
and O
nothing O
else O
, O
" O
answered O
Meg O
warmly O
, O
and O
no O
one O
contradicted O
her O
, O
for O
the O
' O
Mouse O
' O
was O
the O
pet O
of O
the O
family O
. O
As O
young O
readers O
like O
to O
know O
' O
how O
people O
look O
' O
, O
we O
will O
take O
this O
moment O
to O
give O
them O
a O
little O
sketch O
of O
the O
four O
sisters O
, O
who O
sat O
knitting O
away O
in O
the O
twilight O
, O
while O
the O
December O
snow O
fell O
quietly O
without O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
crackled O
cheerfully O
within O
. O
It O
was O
a O
comfortable O
room O
, O
though O
the O
carpet O
was O
faded O
and O
the O
furniture O
very O
plain O
, O
for O
a O
good O
picture O
or O
two O
hung O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
books O
filled O
the O
recesses O
, O
chrysanthemums O
and O
Christmas O
roses O
bloomed O
in O
the O
windows O
, O
and O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
of O
home O
peace O
pervaded O
it O
. O
Margaret O
, O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
four O
, O
was O
sixteen O
, O
and O
very O
pretty O
, O
being O
plump O
and O
fair O
, O
with O
large O
eyes O
, O
plenty O
of O
soft O
brown O
hair O
, O
a O
sweet O
mouth O
, O
and O
white O
hands O
, O
of O
which O
she O
was O
rather O
vain O
. O
Fifteen-year-old O
Jo O
was O
very O
tall O
, O
thin O
, O
and O
brown O
, O
and O
reminded O
one O
of O
a O
colt O
, O
for O
she O
never O
seemed O
to O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
her O
long O
limbs O
, O
which O
were O
very O
much O
in O
her O
way O
. O
She O
had O
a O
decided O
mouth O
, O
a O
comical O
nose O
, O
and O
sharp O
, O
gray O
eyes O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
see O
everything O
, O
and O
were O
by O
turns O
fierce O
, O
funny O
, O
or O
thoughtful O
. O
Her O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
was O
her O
one O
beauty O
, O
but O
it O
was O
usually O
bundled O
into O
a O
net O
, O
to O
be O
out O
of O
her O
way O
. O
Round O
shoulders O
had O
Jo O
, O
big O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
a O
flyaway O
look O
to O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
the O
uncomfortable O
appearance O
of O
a O
girl O
who O
was O
rapidly O
shooting O
up O
into O
a O
woman O
and O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
or O
Beth O
, O
as O
everyone O
called O
her O
, O
was O
a O
rosy O
, O
smooth-haired O
, O
bright-eyed O
girl O
of O
thirteen O
, O
with O
a O
shy O
manner O
, O
a O
timid O
voice O
, O
and O
a O
peaceful O
expression O
which O
was O
seldom O
disturbed O
. O
Her O
father O
called O
her O
' O
Little O
Miss O
Tranquility O
' O
, O
and O
the O
name O
suited O
her O
excellently O
, O
for O
she O
seemed O
to O
live O
in O
a O
happy O
world O
of O
her O
own O
, O
only O
venturing O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
few O
whom O
she O
trusted O
and O
loved O
. O
Amy O
, O
though O
the O
youngest O
, O
was O
a O
most O
important O
person O
, O
in O
her O
own O
opinion O
at O
least O
. O
A O
regular O
snow O
maiden O
, O
with O
blue O
eyes O
, O
and O
yellow O
hair O
curling O
on O
her O
shoulders O
, O
pale O
and O
slender O
, O
and O
always O
carrying O
herself O
like O
a O
young O
lady O
mindful O
of O
her O
manners O
. O
What O
the O
characters O
of O
the O
four O
sisters O
were O
we O
will O
leave O
to O
be O
found O
out O
. O
The O
clock O
struck O
six O
and O
, O
having O
swept O
up O
the O
hearth O
, O
Beth O
put O
a O
pair O
of O
slippers O
down O
to O
warm O
. O
Somehow O

CHAPTER O
I O
— O
START O
IN O
LIFE O
I O
was O
born O
in O
the O
year O
1632 O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
York O
, O
of O
a O
good O
family O
, O
though O
not O
of O
that O
country O
, O
my O
father O
being O
a O
foreigner O
of O
Bremen O
, O
who O
settled O
first O
at O
Hull O
. O
He O
got O
a O
good O
estate O
by O
merchandise O
, O
and O
leaving O
off O
his O
trade O
, O
lived O
afterwards O
at O
York O
, O
from O
whence O
he O
had O
married O
my O
mother O
, O
whose O
relations O
were O
named O
Robinson O
, O
a O
very O
good O
family O
in O
that O
country O
, O
and O
from O
whom O
I O
was O
called O
Robinson O
Kreutznaer O
; O
but O
, O
by O
the O
usual O
corruption O
of O
words O
in O
England O
, O
we O
are O
now O
called O
— O
nay O
we O
call O
ourselves O
and O
write O
our O
name O
— O
Crusoe O
; O
and O
so O
my O
companions O
always O
called O
me O
. O
I O
had O
two O
elder O
brothers O
, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
lieutenant-colonel O
to O
an O
English O
regiment O
of O
foot O
in O
Flanders O
, O
formerly O
commanded O
by O
the O
famous O
Colonel O
Lockhart O
, O
and O
was O
killed O
at O
the O
battle O
near O
Dunkirk O
against O
the O
Spaniards O
. O
What O
became O
of O
my O
second O
brother O
I O
never O
knew O
, O
any O
more O
than O
my O
father O
or O
mother O
knew O
what O
became O
of O
me O
. O
Being O
the O
third O
son O
of O
the O
family O
and O
not O
bred O
to O
any O
trade O
, O
my O
head O
began O
to O
be O
filled O
very O
early O
with O
rambling O
thoughts O
. O
My O
father O
, O
who O
was O
very O
ancient O
, O
had O
given O
me O
a O
competent O
share O
of O
learning O
, O
as O
far O
as O
house-education O
and O
a O
country O
free O
school O
generally O
go O
, O
and O
designed O
me O
for O
the O
law O
; O
but O
I O
would O
be O
satisfied O
with O
nothing O
but O
going O
to O
sea O
; O
and O
my O
inclination O
to O
this O
led O
me O
so O
strongly O
against O
the O
will O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
commands O
of O
my O
father O
, O
and O
against O
all O
the O
entreaties O
and O
persuasions O
of O
my O
mother O
and O
other O
friends O
, O
that O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
something O
fatal O
in O
that O
propensity O
of O
nature O
, O
tending O
directly O
to O
the O
life O
of O
misery O
which O
was O
to O
befall O
me O
. O
My O
father O
, O
a O
wise O
and O
grave O
man O
, O
gave O
me O
serious O
and O
excellent O
counsel O
against O
what O
he O
foresaw O
was O
my O
design O
. O
He O
called O
me O
one O
morning O
into O
his O
chamber O
, O
where O
he O
was O
confined O
by O
the O
gout O
, O
and O
expostulated O
very O
warmly O
with O
me O
upon O
this O
subject O
. O
He O
asked O
me O
what O
reasons O
, O
more O
than O
a O
mere O
wandering O
inclination O
, O
I O
had O
for O
leaving O
father O
’s O
house O
and O
my O
native O
country O
, O
where O
I O
might O
be O
well O
introduced O
, O
and O
had O
a O
prospect O
of O
raising O
my O
fortune O
by O
application O
and O
industry O
, O
with O
a O
life O
of O
ease O
and O
pleasure O
. O
He O
told O
me O
it O
was O
men O
of O
desperate O
fortunes O
on O
one O
hand O
, O
or O
of O
aspiring O
, O
superior O
fortunes O
on O
the O
other O
, O
who O
went O
abroad O
upon O
adventures O
, O
to O
rise O
by O
enterprise O
, O
and O
make O
themselves O
famous O
in O
undertakings O
of O
a O
nature O
out O
of O
the O
common O
road O
; O
that O
these O
things O
were O
all O
either O
too O
far O
above O
me O
or O
too O
far O
below O
me O
; O
that O
mine O
was O
the O
middle O
state O
, O
or O
what O
might O
be O
called O
the O
upper O
station O
of O
low O
life O
, O
which O
he O
had O
found O
, O
by O
long O
experience O
, O
was O
the O
best O
state O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
most O
suited O
to O
human O
happiness O
, O
not O
exposed O
to O
the O
miseries O
and O
hardships O
, O
the O
labour O
and O
sufferings O
of O
the O
mechanic O
part O
of O
mankind O
, O
and O
not O
embarrassed O
with O
the O
pride O
, O
luxury O
, O
ambition O
, O
and O
envy O
of O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
mankind O
. O
He O
told O
me O
I O
might O
judge O
of O
the O
happiness O
of O
this O
state O
by O
this O
one O
thing O
— O
viz O
. O
that O
this O
was O
the O
state O
of O
life O
which O
all O
other O
people O
envied O
; O
that O
kings O
have O
frequently O
lamented O
the O
miserable O
consequence O
of O
being O
born O
to O
great O
things O
, O
and O
wished O
they O
had O
been O
placed O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
two O
extremes O
, O
between O
the O
mean O
and O
the O
great O
; O
that O
the O
wise O
man O
gave O
his O
testimony O
to O
this O
, O
as O
the O
standard O
of O
felicity O
, O
when O
he O
prayed O
to O
have O
neither O
poverty O
nor O
riches O
. O
He O
bade O
me O
observe O
it O
, O
and O
I O
should O
always O
find O
that O
the O
calamities O
of O
life O
were O
shared O
among O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
part O
of O
mankind O
, O
but O
that O
the O
middle O
station O
had O
the O
fewest O
disasters O
, O
and O
was O
not O
exposed O
to O
so O
many O
vicissitudes O
as O
the O
higher O
or O
lower O
part O
of O
mankind O
; O
nay O
, O
they O
were O
not O
subjected O
to O
so O
many O
distempers O
and O
uneasinesses O
, O
either O
of O
body O
or O
mind O
, O
as O
those O
were O
who O
, O
by O
vicious O
living O
, O
luxury O
, O
and O
extravagances O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
or O
by O
hard O
labour O
, O
want O
of O
necessaries O
, O
and O
mean O
or O
insufficient O
diet O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
bring O
distemper O
upon O
themselves O
by O
the O
natural O
consequences O
of O
their O
way O
of O
living O
; O
that O
the O
middle O
station O
of O
life O
was O
calculated O
for O
all O
kind O
of O
virtue O
and O
all O
kind O
of O
enjoyments O
; O
that O
peace O
and O
plenty O
were O
the O
handmaids O
of O
a O
middle O
fortune O
; O
that O
temperance O
, O
moderation O
, O
quietness O
, O
health O
, O
society O
, O
all O
agreeable O
diversions O
, O
and O
all O
desirable O
pleasures O
, O
were O
the O
blessings O
attending O
the O
middle O
station O
of O
life O
; O
that O
this O
way O
men O
went O
silently O
and O
smoothly O
through O
the O
world O
, O
and O
comfortably O
out O
of O
it O
, O
not O
embarrassed O
with O
the O
labours O
of O
the O
hands O
or O
of O
the O
head O
, O
not O
sold O
to O
a O
life O
of O
slavery O
for O
daily O
bread O
, O
nor O
harassed O
with O
perplexed O
circumstances O
, O
which O
rob O
the O
soul O
of O
peace O
and O
the O
body O
of O
rest O
, O
nor O
enraged O
with O
the O
passion O
of O
envy O
, O
or O
the O
secret O
burning O
lust O
of O
ambition O
for O
great O
things O
; O
but O
, O
in O
easy O
circumstances O
, O
sliding O
gently O
through O
the O
world O
, O
and O
sensibly O
tasting O
the O
sweets O
of O
living O
, O
without O
the O
bitter O
; O
feeling O
that O
they O
are O
happy O
, O
and O
learning O
by O
every O
day O
’s O
experience O
to O
know O
it O
more O
sensibly O
. O
After O
this O
he O
pressed O
me O
earnestly O
, O
and O
in O
the O
most O
affectionate O
manner O
, O
not O
to O
play O
the O
young O
man O
, O
nor O
to O
precipitate O
myself O
into O
miseries O
which O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
station O
of O
life O
I O
was O
born O
in O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
provided O
against O
; O
that O
I O
was O
under O
no O
necessity O
of O
seeking O
my O
bread O
; O
that O
he O
would O
do O
well O
for O
me O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
enter O
me O
fairly O
into O
the O
station O
of O
life O
which O
he O
had O
just O
been O
recommending O
to O
me O
; O
and O
that O
if O
I O
was O
not O
very O
easy O
and O
happy O
in O
the O
world O
, O
it O
must O
be O
my O
mere O
fate O
or O
fault O
that O
must O
hinder O
it O
; O
and O
that O
he O
should O
have O
nothing O
to O
answer O
for O
, O
having O
thus O
discharged O
his O
duty O
in O
warning O
me O
against O
measures O
which O
he O
knew O
would O
be O
to O
my O
hurt O
; O
in O
a O
word O
, O
that O
as O
he O
would O
do O
very O
kind O
things O
for O
me O
if O
I O
would O
stay O
and O
settle O
at O
home O
as O
he O
directed O
, O
so O
he O
would O
not O
have O
so O
much O
hand O
in O
my O
misfortunes O
as O
to O
give O
me O
any O
encouragement O
to O
go O
away O
; O
and O
to O
close O
all O
, O
he O
told O
me O
I O
had O
my O
elder O
brother O
for O
an O
example O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
used O
the O
same O
earnest O
persuasions O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
going O
into O
the O
Low O
Country O
wars O
, O
but O
could O
not O
prevail O
, O
his O
young O
desires O
prompting O
him O
to O
run O
into O
the O
army O
, O
where O
he O
was O
killed O
; O
and O
though O
he O
said O
he O
would O
not O
cease O
to O
pray O
for O
me O
, O
yet O
he O
would O
venture O
to O
say O
to O
me O
, O
that O
if O
I O
did O
take O
this O
foolish O
step O
, O
God O
would O
not O
bless O
me O
, O
and O
I O
should O
have O
leisure O
hereafter O
to O
reflect O
upon O
having O
neglected O
his O
counsel O
when O
there O
might O
be O
none O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
recovery O
. O
I O
observed O
in O
this O
last O
part O
of O
his O
discourse O
, O
which O
was O
truly O
prophetic O
, O
though O
I O
suppose O
my O
father O
did O
not O
know O
it O
to O
be O
so O
himself O
— O
I O
say O
, O
I O
observed O
the O
tears O
run O
down O
his O
face O
very O
plentifully O
, O
especially O
when O
he O
spoke O
of O
my O
brother O
who O
was O
killed O
: O
and O
that O
when O
he O
spoke O
of O
my O
having O
leisure O
to O
repent O
, O
and O
none O
to O
assist O
me O
, O
he O
was O
so O
moved O
that O
he O
broke O
off O
the O
discourse O
, O
and O
told O
me O
his O
heart O
was O
so O
full O
he O
could O
say O
no O
more O
to O
me O
. O
I O
was O
sincerely O
affected O
with O
this O
discourse O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
who O
could O
be O
otherwise O
? O
and O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
think O
of O
going O
abroad O
any O
more O
, O
but O
to O
settle O
at O
home O
according O
to O
my O
father O
’s O
desire O
. O
But O
alas O
! O
a O
few O
days O
wore O
it O
all O
off O
; O
and O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
prevent O
any O
of O
my O
father O
’s O
further O
importunities O
, O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
I O
resolved O
to O
run O
quite O
away O
from O
him O
. O
However O
, O
I O
did O
not O
act O
quite O
so O
hastily O
as O
the O
first O
heat O
of O
my O
resolution O
prompted O
; O
but O
I O
took O
my O
mother O
at O
a O
time O
when O
I O
thought O
her O
a O
little O
more O
pleasant O
than O
ordinary O
, O
and O
told O
her O
that O
my O
thoughts O
were O
so O
entirely O
bent O
upon O
seeing O
the O
world O
that O
I O
should O
never O
settle O
to O
anything O
with O
resolution O
enough O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
, O
and O
my O
father O
had O
better O
give O
me O
his O
consent O
than O
force O
me O
to O
go O
without O
it O
; O
that O
I O
was O
now O
eighteen O
years O
old O
, O
which O
was O
too O
late O
to O
go O
apprentice O
to O
a O
trade O
or O
clerk O
to O
an O
attorney O
; O
that O
I O
was O
sure O
if O
I O
did O
I O
should O
never O
serve O
out O
my O
time O
, O
but O
I O
should O
certainly O
run O
away O
from O
my O
master O
before O
my O
time O
was O
out O
, O
and O
go O
to O
sea O
; O
and O
if O
she O
would O
speak O
to O
my O
father O
to O
let O
me O
go O
one O
voyage O
abroad O
, O
if O
I O
came O
home O
again O
, O
and O
did O
not O
like O
it O
, O
I O
would O
go O
no O
more O
; O
and O
I O
would O
promise O
, O
by O
a O
double O
diligence O
, O
to O
recover O
the O
time O
that O
I O
had O
lost O
. O
This O
put O
my O
mother O
into O
a O
great O
passion O
; O
she O
told O
me O
she O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
to O
no O
purpose O
to O
speak O
to O
my O
father O
upon O
any O
such O
subject O
; O
that O
he O
knew O
too O
well O
what O
was O
my O
interest O
to O
give O
his O
consent O
to O
anything O
so O
much O
for O
my O
hurt O
; O
and O
that O
she O
wondered O
how O
I O
could O
think O
of O
any O
such O
thing O
after O
the O
discourse O
I O
had O
had O
with O
my O
father O
, O
and O
such O
kind O
and O
tender O
expressions O
as O
she O
knew O
my O
father O
had O
used O
to O
me O
; O
and O
that O
, O
in O
short O
, O
if O
I O
would O
ruin O
myself O
, O
there O
was O
no O
help O
for O
me O
; O
but O
I O
might O
depend O
I O
should O
never O
have O
their O
consent O
to O
it O
; O
that O
for O
her O
part O
she O
would O
not O
have O
so O
much O
hand O
in O
my O
destruction O
; O
and O
I O
should O
never O
have O
it O
to O
say O
that O
my O
mother O
was O
willing O
when O
my O
father O
was O
not O
. O
Though O
my O
mother O
refused O
to O
move O
it O
to O
my O
father O
, O
yet O
I O
heard O
afterwards O
that O
she O
reported O
all O
the O
discourse O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
my O
father O
, O
after O
showing O
a O
great O
concern O
at O
it O
, O
said O
to O
her O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O
, O
" O
That O
boy O
might O
be O
happy O
if O
he O
would O
stay O
at O
home O
; O
but O
if O
he O
goes O
abroad O
, O
he O
will O
be O
the O
most O
miserable O
wretch O
that O
ever O
was O
born O
: O
I O
can O
give O
no O
consent O
to O
it O
. O
" O
It O
was O
not O
till O
almost O
a O
year O
after O
this O
that O
I O
broke O
loose O
, O
though O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
continued O
obstinately O
deaf O
to O
all O
proposals O
of O
settling O
to O
business O
, O
and O
frequently O
expostulated O
with O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
about O
their O
being O
so O
positively O
determined O
against O
what O
they O
knew O
my O
inclinations O
prompted O
me O
to O
. O
But O
being O
one O
day O
at O
Hull O
, O
where O
I O
went O
casually O
, O
and O
without O
any O
purpose O
of O
making O
an O
elopement O
at O
that O
time O
; O
but O
, O
I O
say O
, O
being O
there O
, O
and O
one O
of O
my O
companions O
being O
about O
to O
sail O
to O
London O
in O
his O
father O
’s O
ship O
, O
and O
prompting O
me O
to O
go O
with O
them O
with O
the O
common O
allurement O
of O
seafaring O
men O
, O
that O
it O
should O
cost O
me O
nothing O
for O
my O
passage O
, O
I O
consulted O
neither O
father O
nor O
mother O
any O
more O
, O
nor O
so O
much O
as O
sent O
them O
word O
of O
it O
; O
but O
leaving O
them O
to O
hear O
of O
it O
as O
they O
might O
, O
without O
asking O
God O
’s O
blessing O
or O
my O
father O
’s O
, O
without O
any O
consideration O
of O
circumstances O
or O
consequences O
, O
and O
in O
an O
ill O
hour O
, O
God O
knows O
, O
on O
the O
1st O
of O
September O
1651 O
, O
I O
went O
on O
board O
a O
ship O
bound O
for O
London O
. O
Never O
any O
young O
adventurer O
’s O
misfortunes O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
began O
sooner O
, O
or O
continued O
longer O
than O
mine O
. O
The O
ship O
was O
no O
sooner O
out O
of O
the O
Humber O
than O
the O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
and O
the O
sea O
to O
rise O
in O
a O
most O
frightful O
manner O
; O
and O
, O
as O
I O
had O
never O
been O
at O
sea O
before O
, O
I O
was O
most O
inexpressibly O
sick O
in O
body O
and O
terrified O
in O
mind O
. O
I O
began O
now O
seriously O
to O
reflect O
upon O
what O
I O
had O
done O
, O
and O
how O
justly O
I O
was O
overtaken O
by O
the O
judgment O
of O
Heaven O
for O
my O
wicked O
leaving O
my O
father O
’s O
house O
, O
and O
abandoning O
my O
duty O
. O
All O
the O
good O
counsels O
of O
my O
parents O
, O
my O
father O
’s O
tears O
and O
my O
mother O
’s O
entreaties O
, O
came O
now O
fresh O
into O
my O
mind O
; O
and O
my O
conscience O
, O
which O
was O
not O
yet O
come O
to O
the O
pitch O
of O
hardness O
to O
which O
it O
has O
since O
, O
reproached O
me O
with O
the O
contempt O
of O
advice O
, O
and O
the O
breach O
of O
my O
duty O
to O
God O
and O
my O

ARRIVAL O
The NOM_PER
stranger NOM_PER
came O
early O
in O
February O
, O
one O
wintry O
day O
, O
through O
a O
biting O
wind O
and O
a O
driving O
snow O
, O

of O
the O

and O
carrying O
a O
little O
black O
portmanteau O
in O
his PRON_PER
thickly O
gloved O
hand O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
wrapped O
up O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
and O
the O
brim O
of O
his PRON_PER
soft O
felt O
hat O
hid O
every O
inch O
of O
his PRON_PER
face O
but O
the O
shiny O
tip O
of O
his PRON_PER
nose O
; O
the O
snow O
had O
piled O
itself O
against O
his PRON_PER
shoulders O
and O
chest O
, O
and O
added O
a O
white O
crest O
to O
the O
burden O
he PRON_PER
carried O
. O
He PRON_PER
staggered O
into O
the O
" O
Coach O
and O
Horses O
" O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
, O
and O
flung O
his PRON_PER
portmanteau O
down O
. O
" O
A O
fire O
, O
" O
he PRON_PER
cried O
, O
" O
in O
the O
name O
of O
human O
charity O
! O
A O
room O
and O
a O
fire O
! O
" O
He PRON_PER
stamped O
and O
shook O
the O
snow O
from O
off O
himself PRON_PER
in O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
followed O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Hall PROP_PER
into O
her PRON_PER
guest O
parlour O
to O
strike O
his PRON_PER
bargain O
. O
And O
with O
that O
much O
introduction O
, O
that O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
sovereigns O
flung O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
he PRON_PER
took O
up O
his PRON_PER
quarters O
in O
the O
inn O
. O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Hall PROP_PER
lit O
the O
fire O
and O
left O
him PRON_PER
there O
while O
she PRON_PER
went O
to O
prepare O
him PRON_PER
a O
meal O
with O
her PRON_PER
own O
hands O
. O
A NOM_PER
guest NOM_PER
to NOM_PER
stop NOM_PER
at NOM_PER
Iping NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
wintertime NOM_PER
was O
an O
unheard-of O
piece O
of O
luck O
, O
let O
alone O
a NOM_PER
guest NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
was NOM_PER
no NOM_PER
" NOM_PER
haggler NOM_PER
, O
" O
and O
she PRON_PER
was O
resolved O
to O
show O
herself PRON_PER
worthy O
of O
her PRON_PER
good O
fortune O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
bacon O
was O
well O
under O
way O
, O
and O
Millie PROP_PER
, O
her NOM_PER
lymphatic NOM_PER
maid NOM_PER
, O
had O
been O
brisked O
up O
a O
bit O
by O
a O
few O
deftly O
chosen O
expressions O
of O
contempt O
, O
she O
carried O
the O
cloth O
, O
plates O
, O
and O
glasses O
into O
the O
parlour O
and O
began O
to O
lay O
them O
with O
the O
utmost O
_ O
eclat O
_ O
. O
Although O
the O
fire O
was O
burning O
up O
briskly O
, O
she O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
her O
visitor O
still O
wore O
his O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
standing O
with O
his O
back O
to O
her O
and O
staring O
out O
of O
the O
window O
at O
the O
falling O
snow O
in O
the O
yard O
. O
His O
gloved O
hands O
were O
clasped O
behind O
him O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
lost O
in O
thought O
. O
She O
noticed O
that O
the O
melting O
snow O
that O
still O
sprinkled O
his O
shoulders O
dripped O
upon O
her O
carpet O
. O
" O
Can O
I O
take O
your O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
and O
give O
them O
a O
good O
dry O
in O
the O
kitchen O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
said O
without O
turning O
. O
She O
was O
not O
sure O
she O
had O
heard O
him O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
repeat O
her O
question O
. O
He O
turned O
his O
head O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
over O
his O
shoulder O
. O
" O
I O
prefer O
to O
keep O
them O
on O
, O
" O
he O
said O
with O
emphasis O
, O
and O
she O
noticed O
that O
he O
wore O
big O
blue O
spectacles O
with O
sidelights O
, O
and O
had O
a O
bush O
side-whisker O
over O
his O
coat-collar O
that O
completely O
hid O
his O
cheeks O
and O
face O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
_ O
As O
_ O
you O
like O
. O
In O
a O
bit O
the O
room O
will O
be O
warmer O
. O
" O
He O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
had O
turned O
his O
face O
away O
from O
her O
again O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hall O
, O
feeling O
that O
her O
conversational O
advances O
were O
ill-timed O
, O
laid O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table O
things O
in O
a O
quick O
staccato O
and O
whisked O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
When O
she O
returned O
he O
was O
still O
standing O
there O
, O
like O
a O
man O
of O
stone O
, O
his O
back O
hunched O
, O
his O
collar O
turned O
up O
, O
his O
dripping O
hat-brim O
turned O
down O
, O
hiding O
his O
face O
and O
ears O
completely O
. O
She O
put O
down O
the O
eggs O
and O
bacon O
with O
considerable O
emphasis O
, O
and O
called O
rather O
than O
said O
to O
him O
, O
" O
Your O
lunch O
is O
served O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
and O
did O
not O
stir O
until O
she O
was O
closing O
the O
door O
. O
Then O
he O
swung O
round O
and O
approached O
the O
table O
with O
a O
certain O
eager O
quickness O
. O
As O
she O
went O
behind O
the O
bar O
to O
the O
kitchen O
she O
heard O
a O
sound O
repeated O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O
Chirk O
, O
chirk O
, O
chirk O
, O
it O
went O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
spoon O
being O
rapidly O
whisked O
round O
a O
basin O
. O
" O
That O
girl O
! O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
There O
! O
I O
clean O
forgot O
it O
. O
It O
's O
her O
being O
so O
long O
! O
" O
And O
while O
she O
herself O
finished O
mixing O
the O
mustard O
, O
she O
gave O
Millie O
a O
few O
verbal O
stabs O
for O
her O
excessive O
slowness O
. O
She O
had O
cooked O
the O
ham O
and O
eggs O
, O
laid O
the O
table O
, O
and O
done O
everything O
, O
while O
Millie O
( O
help O
indeed O
! O
) O
had O
only O
succeeded O
in O
delaying O
the O
mustard O
. O
And O
him O
a O
new O
guest O
and O
wanting O
to O
stay O
! O
Then O
she O
filled O
the O
mustard O
pot O
, O
and O
, O
putting O
it O
with O
a O
certain O
stateliness O
upon O
a O
gold O
and O
black O
tea-tray O
, O
carried O
it O
into O
the O
parlour O
. O
She O
rapped O
and O
entered O
promptly O
. O
As O
she O
did O
so O
her O
visitor O
moved O
quickly O
, O
so O
that O
she O
got O
but O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
white O
object O
disappearing O
behind O
the O
table O
. O
It O
would O
seem O
he O
was O
picking O
something O
from O
the O
floor O
. O
She O
rapped O
down O
the O
mustard O
pot O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
then O
she O
noticed O
the O
overcoat O
and O
hat O
had O
been O
taken O
off O
and O
put O
over O
a O
chair O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
wet O
boots O
threatened O
rust O
to O
her O
steel O
fender O
. O
She O
went O
to O
these O
things O
resolutely O
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
I O
may O
have O
them O
to O
dry O
now O
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
brooked O
no O
denial O
. O
" O
Leave O
the O
hat O
, O
" O
said O
her O
visitor O
, O
in O
a O
muffled O
voice O
, O
and O
turning O
she O
saw O
he O
had O
raised O
his O
head O
and O
was O
sitting O
and O
looking O
at O
her O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
she O
stood O
gaping O
at O
him O
, O
too O
surprised O
to O
speak O
. O
He O
held O
a O
white O
cloth O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
serviette O
he O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
-- O
over O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
his O
mouth O
and O
jaws O
were O
completely O
hidden O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
muffled O
voice O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
that O
which O
startled O
Mrs. O
Hall O
. O
It O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
his O
forehead O
above O
his O
blue O
glasses O
was O
covered O
by O
a O
white O
bandage O
, O
and O
that O
another O
covered O
his O
ears O
, O
leaving O
not O
a O
scrap O
of O
his O
face O
exposed O
excepting O
only O
his O
pink O
, O
peaked O
nose O
. O
It O
was O
bright O
, O
pink O
, O
and O
shiny O
just O
as O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
dark-brown O
velvet O
jacket O
with O
a O
high O
, O
black O
, O
linen-lined O
collar O
turned O
up O
about O
his O
neck O
. O
The O
thick O
black O
hair O
, O
escaping O
as O
it O
could O
below O
and O
between O
the O
cross O
bandages O
, O
projected O
in O
curious O
tails O
and O
horns O
, O
giving O
him O
the O
strangest O
appearance O
conceivable O
. O
This O
muffled O
and O
bandaged O
head O
was O
so O
unlike O
what O
she O
had O
anticipated O
, O
that O
for O
a O
moment O
she O
was O
rigid O
. O
He O
did O
not O
remove O
the O
serviette O
, O
but O
remained O
holding O
it O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
now O
, O
with O
a O
brown O
gloved O
hand O
, O
and O
regarding O
her O
with O
his O
inscrutable O
blue O
glasses O
. O
" O
Leave O
the O
hat O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
speaking O
very O
distinctly O
through O
the O
white O
cloth O
. O
Her O
nerves O
began O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
shock O
they O
had O
received O
. O
She O
placed O
the O
hat O
on O
the O
chair O
again O
by O
the O
fire O
. O
" O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
she O
began O
, O
" O
that O
-- O
" O
and O
she O
stopped O
embarrassed O
. O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
drily O
, O
glancing O
from O
her O
to O
the O
door O
and O
then O
at O
her O
again O
. O
" O
I O
'll O
have O
them O
nicely O
dried O
, O
sir O
, O
at O
once O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
and O
carried O
his O
clothes O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
She O
glanced O
at O
his O
white-swathed O
head O
and O
blue O
goggles O
again O
as O
she O
was O
going O
out O
of O
the O
door O
; O
but O
his O
napkin O
was O
still O
in O
front O
of O
his O
face O
. O
She O
shivered O
a O
little O
as O
she O
closed O
the O
door O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
eloquent O
of O
her O
surprise O
and O
perplexity O
. O
" O
I O
_ O
never O
_ O
, O
" O
she O
whispered O
. O
" O
There O
! O
" O
She O
went O
quite O
softly O
to O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
was O
too O
preoccupied O
to O
ask O
Millie O
what O
she O
was O
messing O
about O
with O
_ O
now O
_ O
, O
when O
she O
got O
there O
. O
The O
visitor O
sat O
and O
listened O
to O
her O
retreating O
feet O
. O
He O
glanced O
inquiringly O
at O
the O
window O
before O
he O
removed O
his O
serviette O
, O
and O
resumed O
his O
meal O
. O
He O
took O
a O
mouthful O
, O
glanced O
suspiciously O
at O
the O
window O
, O
took O
another O
mouthful O
, O
then O
rose O
and O
, O
taking O
the O
serviette O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
walked O
across O
the O
room O
and O
pulled O
the O
blind O
down O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
white O
muslin O
that O
obscured O
the O
lower O
panes O
. O
This O
left O
the O
room O
in O
a O
twilight O
. O
This O
done O
, O
he O
returned O
with O
an O
easier O
air O
to O
the O
table O
and O
his O
meal O
. O
" O
The O
poor O
soul O
's O
had O
an O
accident O
or O
an O
op O
' O
ration O
or O
somethin' O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hall O
. O
" O
What O
a O
turn O
them O
bandages O
did O
give O
me O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
" O
She O
put O
on O
some O
more O
coal O
, O
unfolded O
the O
clothes-horse O
, O
and O
extended O
the O
traveller O
's O
coat O
upon O
this O
. O
" O
And O
they O
goggles O
! O
Why O
, O
he O
looked O
more O
like O
a O
divin O
' O
helmet O
than O
a O
human O
man O
! O
" O
She O
hung O
his O
muffler O
on O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
horse O
. O
" O
And O
holding O
that O
handkerchief O
over O
his O
mouth O
all O
the O
time O
. O
Talkin O
' O
through O
it O
! O
... O
Perhaps O
his O
mouth O
was O
hurt O
too O
-- O
maybe O
. O
" O
She O
turned O
round O
, O
as O
one O
who O
suddenly O
remembers O
. O
" O
Bless O
my O
soul O
alive O
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O

Millie O
? O
" O
When O
Mrs. O
Hall O
went O
to O
clear O
away O
the O
stranger O
's O
lunch O
, O
her O
idea O
that O
his O
mouth O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cut O
or O
disfigured O
in O
the O
accident O
she O
supposed O
him O
to O
have O
suffered O
, O
was O
confirmed O
, O
for O
he O
was O
smoking O
a O
pipe O
, O
and O
all O
the O
time O
that O
she O
was O
in O
the O
room O
he O
never O
loosened O
the O
silk O
muffler O
he O
had O
wrapped O
round O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
his O
face O
to O
put O
the O
mouthpiece O
to O
his O
lips O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
not O
forgetfulness O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
he O
glanced O
at O
it O
as O
it O
smouldered O
out O
. O
He O
sat O
in O
the O
corner O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
window-blind O
and O
spoke O
now O
, O
having O
eaten O
and O
drunk O
and O
being O
comfortably O
warmed O
through O
, O
with O
less O
aggressive O
brevity O
than O
before O
. O
The O
reflection O
of O
the O
fire O
lent O
a O
kind O
of O
red O
animation O
to O
his O
big O
spectacles O
they O
had O
lacked O
hitherto O
. O
" O
I O
have O
some O
luggage O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
at O
Bramblehurst O
station O
, O
" O
and O
he O
asked O
her O
how O
he O
could O
have O
it O
sent O
. O
He O
bowed O
his O
bandaged O
head O
quite O
politely O
in O
acknowledgment O
of O
her O
explanation O
. O
" O
To-morrow O
? O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
speedier O
delivery O
? O
" O
and O
seemed O
quite O
disappointed O
when O
she O
answered O
, O
" O
No O
. O
" O
Was O
she O
quite O
sure O
? O
No O
man O
with O
a O
trap O
who O
would O
go O
over O
? O
Mrs. O
Hall O
, O
nothing O
loath O
, O
answered O
his O
questions O
and O
developed O
a O
conversation O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a O
steep O
road O
by O
the O
down O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
about O
a O
trap O
; O
and O
then O
, O
snatching O
at O
an O
opening O
, O
said O
, O
" O
It O
was O
there O
a O
carriage O
was O
upsettled O
, O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
more O
. O

gentleman O
killed O

in O
a O
moment O

they O
? O
" O
But O
the O
visitor O
was O
not O
to O
be O
drawn O
so O
easily O
. O
" O
They O
do O
, O
" O
he O
said O
through O
his O
muffler O

TO O
THE NOM_PER
READER NOM_PER

a NOM_PER
rough NOM_PER

Ragged PROP_PER
Dick PROP_PER
opened O
his PRON_PER
eyes O
slowly O
, O
and O
stared O
stupidly O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the NOM_PER
speaker NOM_PER
, O
but O
did O
not O
offer O
to O
get O
up O
. O
" O
Wake O
up O
, O
you NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
vagabond NOM_PER
! O
" O
said O
the O
man O
a O
little O
impatiently O
; O
" O
I O
suppose O
you O
'd O
lay O
there O
all O
day O
, O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
called O
you O
. O
" O
" O
What O
time O
is O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
Dick O
. O
" O
Seven O
o'clock O
. O
" O
" O
Seven O
o'clock O
! O
I O
oughter O
've O
been O
up O
an O
hour O
ago O
. O
I O
know O
what O
't O
was O
made O
me O
so O
precious O
sleepy O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Old O
Bowery O
last O
night O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
turn O
in O
till O
past O
twelve O
. O
" O
" O
You O
went O
to O
the O
Old O
Bowery O
? O
Where O
'd O
you O
get O
your O
money O
? O
" O
asked O
the O
man O
, O
who O
was O
a O
porter O
in O
the O
employ O
of O
a O
firm O
doing O
business O
on O
Spruce O
Street O
. O
" O
Made O
it O
by O
shines O
, O
in O
course O
. O
My O
guardian O
do O
n't O
allow O
me O
no O
money O
for O
theatres O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
earn O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Some O
boys O
get O
it O
easier O
than O
that O
, O
" O
said O
the O
porter O
significantly O
. O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
catch O
me O
stealin O
' O
, O
if O
that O
's O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
you O
ever O
steal O
, O
then O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
. O
Lots O
of O
boys O
does O
it O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
that O
. O
I O
believe O
there O
's O
some O
good O
in O
you O
, O
Dick O
, O
after O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
rough O
customer O
! O
" O
said O
Dick O
. O
" O
But O
I O
would O
n't O
steal O
. O
It O
's O
mean O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'm O
glad O
you O
think O
so O
, O
Dick O
, O
" O
and O
the O
rough O
voice O
sounded O
gentler O
than O
at O
first O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
got O
any O
money O
to O
buy O
your O
breakfast O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
soon O
get O
some O
. O
" O
While O
this O
conversation O
had O
been O
going O
on O
, O
Dick O
had O
got O
up O
. O
His O
bedchamber O
had O
been O
a O
wooden O
box O
half O
full O
of O
straw O
, O
on O
which O
the O
young O
boot-black O
had O
reposed O
his O
weary O
limbs O
, O
and O
slept O
as O
soundly O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
bed O
of O
down O
. O
He O
dumped O
down O
into O
the O
straw O
without O
taking O
the O
trouble O
of O
undressing O
. O
Getting O
up O
too O
was O
an O
equally O
short O
process O
. O
He O
jumped O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
shook O
himself O
, O
picked O
out O
one O
or O
two O
straws O
that O
had O
found O
their O
way O
into O
rents O
in O
his O
clothes O
, O
and O
, O
drawing O
a O
well-worn O
cap O
over O
his O
uncombed O
locks O
, O
he O
was O
all O
ready O
for O
the O
business O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Dick O
's O
appearance O
as O
he O
stood O
beside O
the O
box O
was O
rather O
peculiar O
. O
His O
pants O
were O
torn O
in O
several O
places O
, O
and O
had O
apparently O
belonged O
in O
the O
first O
instance O
to O
a O
boy O
two O
sizes O
larger O
than O
himself O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
vest O
, O
all O
the O
buttons O
of O
which O
were O
gone O
except O
two O
, O
out O
of O
which O
peeped O
a O
shirt O
which O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
worn O
a O
month O
. O
To O
complete O
his O
costume O
he O
wore O
a O
coat O
too O
long O
for O
him O
, O
dating O
back O
, O
if O
one O
might O
judge O
from O
its O
general O
appearance O
, O
to O
a O
remote O
antiquity O
. O
Washing O
the O
face O
and O
hands O
is O
usually O
considered O
proper O
in O
commencing O
the O
day O
, O
but O
Dick O
was O
above O
such O
refinement O
. O
He O
had O
no O
particular O
dislike O
to O
dirt O
, O
and O
did O
not O
think O
it O
necessary O
to O
remove O
several O
dark O
streaks O
on O
his O
face O
and O
hands O
. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
dirt O
and O
rags O
there O
was O
something O
about O
Dick O
that O
was O
attractive O
. O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
that O
if O
he O
had O
been O
clean O
and O
well O
dressed O
he O
would O
have O
been O
decidedly O
good-looking O
. O
Some O
of O
his O
companions O
were O
sly O
, O
and O
their O
faces O
inspired O
distrust O
; O
but O
Dick O
had O
a O
frank O
, O
straight-forward O
manner O
that O
made O
him O
a O
favorite O
. O
Dick O
's O
business O
hours O
had O
commenced O
. O
He O
had O
no O
office O
to O
open O
. O
His O
little O
blacking-box O
was O
ready O
for O
use O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
sharply O
in O
the O
faces O
of O
all O
who O
passed O
, O
addressing O
each O
with O
, O
" O
Shine O
yer O
boots O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
How O
much O
? O
" O
asked O
a O
gentleman O
on O
his O
way O
to O
his O
office O
. O
" O
Ten O
cents O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
, O
dropping O
his O
box O
, O
and O
sinking O
upon O
his O
knees O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
, O
flourishing O
his O
brush O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one O
skilled O
in O
his O
profession O
. O
" O
Ten O
cents O
! O
Is O
n't O
that O
a O
little O
steep O
? O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
' O
taint O
all O
clear O
profit O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
, O
who O
had O
already O
set O
to O
work O
. O
" O
There O
's O
the O
_ O
blacking O
_ O
costs O
something O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
get O
a O
new O
brush O
pretty O
often O
. O
" O
" O
And O
you O
have O
a O
large O
rent O
too O
, O
" O
said O
the O
gentleman O
quizzically O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
at O
a O
large O
hole O
in O
Dick O
's O
coat O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
, O
always O
ready O
to O
joke O
; O
" O
I O
have O
to O
pay O
such O
a O
big O
rent O
for O
my O
manshun O
up O
on O
Fifth O
Avenoo O
, O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
take O
less O
than O
ten O
cents O
a O
shine O
. O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
a O
bully O
shine O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Be O
quick O
about O
it O
, O
for O
I O
am O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
So O
your O
house O
is O
on O
Fifth O
Avenue O
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
n't O
anywhere O
else O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
, O
and O
Dick O
spoke O
the O
truth O
there O
. O
" O
What O
tailor O
do O
you O
patronize O
? O
" O
asked O
the O
gentleman O
, O
surveying O
Dick O
's O
attire O
. O
" O
Would O
you O
like O
to O
go O
to O
the O
same O
one O
? O
" O
asked O
Dick O
, O
shrewdly O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
no O
; O
it O
strikes O
me O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
give O
you O
a O
very O
good O
fit O
. O
" O
" O
This O
coat O
once O
belonged O
to O
General O
Washington O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
, O
comically O
. O
" O
He O
wore O
it O
all O
through O
the O
Revolution O
, O
and O
it O
got O
torn O
some O
, O
'cause O
he O
fit O
so O
hard O
. O
When O
he O
died O
he O
told O
his O
widder O
to O
give O
it O
to O
some O
smart O
young O
feller O
that O
had O
n't O
got O
none O
of O
his O
own O
; O
so O
she O
gave O
it O
to O
me O
. O
But O
if O
you O
'd O
like O
it O
, O
sir O
, O
to O
remember O
General O
Washington O
by O
, O
I O
'll O
let O
you O
have O
it O
reasonable O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
deprive O
you O
of O
it O
. O
And O
did O
your O
pants O
come O
from O
General O
Washington O
too O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
they O
was O
a O
gift O
from O
Lewis O
Napoleon O
. O
Lewis O
had O
outgrown O
'em O
and O
sent O
'em O
to O
me O
, O
-- O
he O
's O
bigger O
than O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
do O
n't O
fit O
. O
" O
" O
It O
seems O
you O
have O
distinguished O
friends O
. O
Now O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
I O
suppose O
you O
would O
like O
your O
money O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
any O
objection O
, O
" O
said O
Dick O
. O
" O
I O
believe O
, O
" O
said O
the O
gentleman O
, O
examining O
his O
pocket-book O
, O
" O
I O
have O
n't O
got O
anything O
short O
of O
twenty-five O
cents O

Have O
you O

Not O

" O
All O

sir O
; O
I O
'll O
bring O
it O

" O
" O
I O
wonder O
whether O
the O
little O
scamp O
will O
prove O
honest O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Greyson O
to O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
walked O
away O

" O
If O
he O
does O

I O
'll O
give O
him O
my O
custom O
regularly O

If O
he O
do O

as O
is O
most O
likely O
, O
I O
sha O
n't O
mind O
the O
loss O
of O
fifteen O
cents O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Greyson O
did O
n't O
understand O
Dick O
. O
Our O
ragged O
hero O
was O
n't O
a O
model O
boy O
in O
all O
respects O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
swore O
sometimes O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
he O
played O
tricks O
upon O
unsophisticated O
boys O
from O
the O
country O
, O
or O
gave O
a O
wrong O
direction O
to O
honest O
old O
gentlemen O
unused O
to O
the O
city O
. O
A O
clergyman O
in O
search O
of O
the O
Cooper O
Institute O
he O
once O
directed O
to O
the O
Tombs O
Prison O
, O
and O
, O
following O
him O
unobserved O
, O
was O
highly O
delighted O
when O
the O
unsuspicious O
stranger O
walked O
up O
the O
front O
steps O
of O
the O
great O
stone O
building O
on O
Centre O
Street O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
obtain O
admission O
. O
" O
I O
guess O
he O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
stay O
long O
if O
he O
did O
get O
in O
, O
" O
thought O
Ragged O
Dick O
, O
hitching O
up O
his O
pants O
. O
" O
Leastways O
I O
should O

're O
so O
precious O

you O

" O
Another O
of O
Dick O
's O
faults O
was O
his O
extravagance O
. O
Being O
always O
wide-awake O
and O
ready O
for O
business O
, O
he O
earned O
enough O
to O

him O
comfortably O

There O
were O
not O
a O
few O
young O
clerks O
who O
employed O
Dick O
from O
time O
to O
time O
in O
his O
professional O
capacity O
, O
who O
scarcely O
earned O
as O
much O
as O
he O
, O
greatly O
as O
their O
style O
and O
dress O
exceeded O
his O
. O
But O
Dick O
was O
careless O
of O
his O
earnings O
. O
Where O
they O
went O
he O
could O
hardly O
have O
told O
himself O
. O
However O
much O
he O
managed O
to O
earn O
during O
the O
day O
, O
all O
was O
generally O
spent O
before O
morning O
. O
He O
was O
fond O
of O
going O
to O
the O
Old O
Bowery O
Theatre O
, O
and O
to O
Tony O
Pastor O
's O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
any O
money O
left O
afterwards O
, O
he O
would O
invite O
some O
of O
his O
friends O
in O
somewhere O
to O
have O
an O
oyster-stew O
; O
so O
it O
seldom O
happened O
that O
he O
commenced O
the O
day O
with O
a O
penny O
. O
Then O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
add O
that O
Dick O
had O
formed O
the O
habit O
of O
smoking O
. O
This O
cost O
him O
considerable O
, O
for O
Dick O
was O
rather O
fastidious O
about O
his O
cigars O
, O
and O
would O
n't O
smoke O
the O
cheapest O
. O
Besides O
, O
having O
a O
liberal O
nature O
, O
he O
was O
generally O
ready O
to O
treat O
his O
companions O
. O
But O
of O
course O
the O
expense O
was O
the O
smallest O
objection O
. O
No O
boy O
of O
fourteen O
can O
smoke O
without O
being O
affected O
injuriously O
. O
Men O
are O
frequently O
injured O
by O
smoking O
, O
and O
boys O
always O
. O
But O
large O
numbers O
of O
the O
newsboys O
and O
boot-blacks O
form O
the O
habit O
. O
Exposed O
to O
the O
cold O
and O
wet O
they O
find O
that O
it O
warms O
them O
up O
, O
and O
the O
self-indulgence O
grows O
upon O
them O
. O
It O
is O
not O
uncommon O
to O
see O
a O
little O
boy O
, O
too O
young O
to O
be O
out O
of O
his O
mother O
's O
sight O
, O
smoking O
with O
all O
the O
apparent O
satisfaction O
of O
a O
veteran O
smoker O
. O
There O
was O
another O
way O
in O
which O
Dick O
sometimes O
lost O
money O
. O
There O
was O
a O
noted O
gambling-house O
on O
Baxter O
Street O
, O
which O
in O
the O
evening O
was O
sometimes O
crowded O
with O
these O
juvenile O
gamesters O
, O
who O
staked O
their O
hard O
earnings O
, O
generally O
losing O
of O
course O
, O
and O
refreshing O
themselves O
from O
time O
to O
time O
with O
a O
vile O
mixture O
of O
liquor O
at O
two O
cents O
a O
glass O
. O
Sometimes O
Dick O
strayed O
in O
here O
, O
and O
played O
with O
the O
rest O
. O
I O
have O
mentioned O
Dick O
's O
faults O
and O
defects O
, O
because O
I O
want O
it O
understood O
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
him O
a O
model O
boy O
. O
But O
there O
were O
some O
good O
points O
about O
him O
nevertheless O
. O
He O
was O
above O
doing O
anything O
mean O
or O
dishonorable O
. O
He O
would O
not O
steal O
, O
or O
cheat O
, O
or O
impose O
upon O
younger O
boys O
, O
but O
was O
frank O
and O
straight-forward O
, O
manly O
and O
self-reliant O
. O
His O
nature O
was O
a O
noble O
one O
, O
and O
had O
saved O
him O
from O
all O
mean O
faults O
. O
I O
hope O
my O
young O
readers O
will O
like O
him O
as O
I O
do O
, O
without O
being O
blind O
to O
his O
faults O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
although O
he O
was O
only O
a O
boot-black O
, O
they O
may O
find O
something O
in O
him O
to O
imitate O
. O

Christine PROP_PER

was O
almost O

When O
Newland PROP_PER
Archer PROP_PER
opened O
the O
door O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
club O
box O
the O
curtain O
had O
just O
gone O
up O
on O
the O
garden O
scene O

There O
was O
no O
reason O
why O
the NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
should O
not O
have O
come O

for O
he PRON_PER

alone O
with O
his NOM_PER
mother NOM_PER
and O
sister O
, O
and O
had O
lingered O
afterward O
over O
a O
cigar O
in O
the O
Gothic O
library O
with O
glazed O
black-walnut O
bookcases O
and O
finial-topped O
chairs O
which O
was O
the O
only O
room O
in O
the O
house O
where O
Mrs. O
Archer O
allowed O
smoking O
. O
But O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
New O
York O
was O
a O
metropolis O
, O
and O
perfectly O
aware O
that O
in O
metropolises O
it O
was O
" O
not O
the O
thing O
" O
to O
arrive O
early O
at O
the O
opera O
; O
and O
what O
was O
or O
was O
not O
" O
the O
thing O
" O
played O
a O
part O
as O
important O
in O
Newland O
Archer O
's O
New O
York O
as O
the O
inscrutable O
totem O
terrors O
that O
had O
ruled O
the O
destinies O
of O
his O
forefathers O
thousands O
of O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
second O
reason O
for O
his O
delay O
was O
a O
personal O
one O
. O
He O
had O
dawdled O
over O
his O
cigar O
because O
he O
was O
at O
heart O
a O
dilettante O
, O
and O
thinking O
over O
a O
pleasure O
to O
come O
often O
gave O
him O
a O
subtler O
satisfaction O
than O
its O
realisation O
. O
This O
was O
especially O
the O
case O
when O
the O
pleasure O
was O
a O
delicate O
one O
, O
as O
his O
pleasures O
mostly O
were O
; O
and O
on O
this O
occasion O
the O
moment O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
was O
so O
rare O
and O
exquisite O
in O
quality O
that O
-- O
well O
, O
if O
he O
had O
timed O
his O
arrival O
in O
accord O
with O
the O
prima O
donna O
's O
stage-manager O
he O
could O
not O
have O
entered O
the O
Academy O
at O
a O
more O
significant O
moment O
than O
just O
as O
she O
was O
singing O
: O
" O
He O
loves O
me O
-- O
he O
loves O
me O
not O
-- O
HE O
LOVES O
ME O
! O
-- O
" O
and O
sprinkling O
the O
falling O
daisy O
petals O
with O
notes O
as O
clear O
as O
dew O
. O
She O
sang O
, O
of O
course O
, O
" O
M'ama O
! O
" O
and O
not O
" O
he O
loves O
me O
, O
" O
since O
an O
unalterable O
and O
unquestioned O
law O
of O
the O
musical O
world O
required O
that O
the O
German O
text O
of O
French O
operas O
sung O
by O
Swedish O
artists O
should O
be O
translated O
into O
Italian O
for O
the O
clearer O
understanding O
of O
English-speaking O
audiences O
. O
This O
seemed O
as O
natural O
to O
Newland O
Archer O
as O
all O
the O
other O
conventions O
on O
which O
his O
life O
was O
moulded O
: O
such O
as O
the O
duty O
of O
using O
two O
silver-backed O
brushes O
with O
his O
monogram O
in O
blue O
enamel O
to O
part O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
of O
never O
appearing O
in O
society O
without O
a O
flower O
( O
preferably O
a O
gardenia O
) O
in O
his O
buttonhole O
. O
" O
M'ama O
... O
non O
m O
' O
ama O
... O
" O
the O
prima O
donna O
sang O
, O
and O
" O
M'ama O
! O
" O
, O
with O
a O
final O
burst O
of O
love O
triumphant O
, O
as O
she O
pressed O
the O
dishevelled O
daisy O
to O
her O
lips O
and O
lifted O
her O
large O
eyes O
to O
the O
sophisticated O
countenance O
of O
the O
little O
brown O
Faust-Capoul O
, O
who O
was O
vainly O
trying O
, O
in O
a O
tight O
purple O
velvet O
doublet O
and O
plumed O
cap O
, O
to O
look O
as O
pure O
and O
true O
as O
his O
artless O
victim O
. O
Newland O
Archer O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
wall O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
club O
box O
, O
turned O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
stage O
and O
scanned O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
house O
. O
Directly O
facing O
him O
was O
the O
box O
of O
old O
Mrs. O
Manson O
Mingott O
, O
whose O
monstrous O
obesity O
had O
long O
since O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
attend O
the O
Opera O
, O
but O
who O
was O
always O
represented O
on O
fashionable O
nights O
by O
some O
of O
the O
younger O
members O
of O
the O
family O
. O
On O
this O
occasion O
, O
the O
front O
of O
the O
box O
was O
filled O
by O
her O
daughter-in-law O
, O
Mrs. O
Lovell O
Mingott O
, O
and O
her O
daughter O
, O
Mrs. O
Welland O
; O
and O
slightly O
withdrawn O
behind O
these O
brocaded O
matrons O
sat O
a O
young O
girl O
in O
white O
with O
eyes O
ecstatically O
fixed O
on O
the O
stagelovers O
. O
As O
Madame O
Nilsson O
's O
" O
M'ama O
! O
" O
thrilled O
out O
above O
the O
silent O
house O
( O
the O
boxes O
always O
stopped O
talking O
during O
the O
Daisy O
Song O
) O
a O
warm O
pink O
mounted O
to O
the O
girl O
's O
cheek O
, O
mantled O
her O
brow O
to O
the O
roots O
of O
her O
fair O
braids O
, O
and O
suffused O
the O
young O
slope O
of O
her O
breast O
to O
the O
line O
where O
it O
met O
a O
modest O
tulle O
tucker O
fastened O
with O
a O
single O
gardenia O
. O
She O
dropped O
her O
eyes O
to O
the O
immense O
bouquet O
of O
lilies-of-the-valley O
on O
her O
knee O
, O
and O
Newland O
Archer O
saw O
her O
white-gloved O
finger-tips O
touch O
the O
flowers O
softly O
. O
He O
drew O
a O
breath O
of O
satisfied O
vanity O
and O
his O
eyes O
returned O
to O
the O
stage O
. O
No O
expense O
had O
been O
spared O
on O
the O
setting O
, O
which O
was O
acknowledged O
to O
be O
very O
beautiful O
even O
by O
people O
who O
shared O
his O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
Opera O
houses O
of O
Paris O
and O
Vienna O
. O
The O
foreground O
, O
to O
the O
footlights O
, O
was O
covered O
with O
emerald O
green O
cloth O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
distance O
symmetrical O
mounds O
of O
woolly O
green O
moss O
bounded O
by O
croquet O
hoops O
formed O
the O
base O
of O
shrubs O
shaped O
like O
orange-trees O
but O
studded O
with O
large O
pink O
and O
red O
roses O
. O
Gigantic O
pansies O
, O
considerably O
larger O
than O
the O
roses O
, O
and O
closely O
resembling O
the O
floral O
pen-wipers O
made O
by O
female O
parishioners O
for O
fashionable O
clergymen O
, O
sprang O
from O
the O
moss O
beneath O
the O
rose-trees O
; O
and O
here O
and O
there O
a O
daisy O
grafted O
on O
a O
rose-branch O
flowered O
with O
a O
luxuriance O
prophetic O
of O
Mr. O
Luther O
Burbank O
's O
far-off O
prodigies O
. O
In O
the O
centre O
of O
this O
enchanted O
garden O
Madame O
Nilsson O
, O
in O
white O
cashmere O
slashed O
with O
pale O
blue O
satin O
, O
a O
reticule O
dangling O
from O
a O
blue O
girdle O
, O
and O
large O
yellow O
braids O
carefully O
disposed O
on O
each O
side O
of O
her O
muslin O
chemisette O
, O
listened O
with O
downcast O
eyes O
to O
M. O
Capoul O
's O
impassioned O
wooing O
, O
and O
affected O
a O
guileless O
incomprehension O
of O
his O
designs O
whenever O
, O
by O
word O
or O
glance O
, O
he O
persuasively O
indicated O
the O
ground O
floor O
window O
of O
the O
neat O
brick O
villa O
projecting O
obliquely O
from O
the O
right O
wing O
. O
" O
The O
darling O
! O
" O
thought O
Newland O
Archer O
, O
his O
glance O
flitting O
back O
to O
the O
young O
girl O
with O
the O
lilies-of-the-valley O
. O
" O
She O
does O
n't O
even O
guess O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O
" O
And O
he O
contemplated O
her O
absorbed O
young O
face O
with O
a O
thrill O
of O
possessorship O
in O
which O
pride O
in O
his O
own O
masculine O
initiation O
was O
mingled O
with O
a O
tender O
reverence O
for O
her O
abysmal O
purity O
. O
" O
We O
'll O
read O
Faust O
together O
... O
by O
the O
Italian O
lakes O
... O
" O
he O
thought O
, O
somewhat O
hazily O
confusing O
the O
scene O
of O
his O
projected O
honey-moon O
with O
the O
masterpieces O
of O
literature O
which O
it O
would O
be O
his O
manly O
privilege O
to O
reveal O
to O
his O
bride O
. O
It O
was O
only O
that O
afternoon O
that O
May O
Welland O
had O
let O
him O
guess O
that O
she O
" O
cared O
" O
( O
New O
York O
's O
consecrated O
phrase O
of O
maiden O
avowal O
) O
, O
and O
already O
his O
imagination O
, O
leaping O
ahead O
of O
the O
engagement O
ring O
, O
the O
betrothal O
kiss O
and O
the O
march O
from O
Lohengrin O
, O
pictured O
her O
at O
his O
side O
in O
some O
scene O
of O
old O
European O
witchery O
. O
He O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
wish O
the O
future O
Mrs. O
Newland O
Archer O
to O
be O
a O
simpleton O
. O
He O
meant O
her O
( O
thanks O
to O
his O
enlightening O
companionship O
) O
to O
develop O
a O
social O
tact O
and O
readiness O
of O

enabling O
her O
to O
hold O
her O
own O
with O
the O
most O
popular O

women O
of O
the O

it O

playfully O
discouraging O
it O
. O
If O
he O
had O
probed O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
vanity O
( O
as O
he O
sometimes O
nearly O
did O
) O
he O
would O
have O
found O
there O
the O
wish O
that O
his O
wife O
should O
be O
as O
worldly-wise O
and O
as O
eager O
to O
please O
as O
the O
married O
lady O
whose O
charms O
had O
held O
his O
fancy O
through O
two O
mildly O
agitated O
years O
; O
without O
, O
of O
course O
, O
any O
hint O
of O
the O
frailty O
which O
had O
so O
nearly O
marred O
that O
unhappy O
being O
's O
life O
, O
and O
had O
disarranged O
his O
own O
plans O
for O
a O
whole O
winter O
. O
How O
this O
miracle O
of O
fire O
and O
ice O
was O
to O
be O
created O
, O
and O
to O
sustain O
itself O
in O
a O
harsh O
world O
, O
he O
had O
never O
taken O
the O
time O
to O
think O
out O
; O
but O
he O
was O
content O
to O
hold O
his O
view O
without O
analysing O
it O
, O
since O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
that O
of O
all O
the O
carefully-brushed O
, O
white-waistcoated O
, O
button-hole-flowered O
gentlemen O
who O
succeeded O
each O
other O
in O
the O
club O
box O
, O
exchanged O
friendly O
greetings O
with O
him O
, O
and O
turned O
their O
opera-glasses O
critically O
on O
the O
circle O
of O
ladies O
who O
were O
the O
product O
of O
the O
system O
. O
In O
matters O
intellectual O
and O
artistic O
Newland O
Archer O
felt O
himself O
distinctly O
the O
superior O
of O
these O
chosen O
specimens O
of O
old O
New O
York O
gentility O
; O
he O
had O
probably O
read O
more O
, O
thought O
more O
, O
and O
even O
seen O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
of O
the O
world O
, O
than O
any O
other O
man O
of O
the O
number O
. O
Singly O
they O
betrayed O
their O
inferiority O
; O
but O
grouped O
together O
they O
represented O
" O
New O
York O
, O
" O
and O
the O
habit O
of O
masculine O
solidarity O
made O
him O
accept O
their O
doctrine O
on O
all O
the O
issues O
called O
moral O
. O
He O
instinctively O
felt O
that O
in O
this O
respect O
it O
would O
be O
troublesome O
-- O
and O
also O
rather O
bad O
form O
-- O
to O
strike O
out O
for O
himself O
. O
" O
Well O
-- O
upon O
my O
soul O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Lawrence O
Lefferts O
, O
turning O
his O
opera-glass O
abruptly O
away O
from O
the O
stage O
. O
Lawrence O
Lefferts O
was O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
the O
foremost O
authority O
on O
" O
form O
" O
in O
New O
York O
. O
He O
had O
probably O
devoted O
more O
time O
than O
any O
one O
else O
to O
the O
study O
of O
this O
intricate O
and O
fascinating O
question O
; O
but O
study O
alone O
could O
not O
account O
for O
his O
complete O
and O
easy O
competence O
. O
One O
had O
only O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
from O
the O
slant O
of O
his O
bald O
forehead O
and O
the O
curve O
of O
his O
beautiful O
fair O
moustache O
to O
the O
long O
patent-leather O
feet O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
his O
lean O
and O
elegant O
person O
, O
to O
feel O
that O
the O
knowledge O
of O
" O
form O
" O
must O
be O
congenital O
in O
any O
one O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
wear O
such O
good O
clothes O
so O
carelessly O
and O
carry O
such O
height O
with O
so O
much O
lounging O
grace O
. O
As O
a O
young O
admirer O
had O
once O
said O
of O
him O
: O
" O
If O
anybody O
can O
tell O
a O
fellow O
just O
when O
to O
wear O
a O
black O
tie O
with O
evening O
clothes O
and O
when O
not O
to O

it O

Larry O
Lefferts O
. O
" O
And O
on O
the O
question O
of O
pumps O
versus O
patent-leather O
" O
Oxfords O
" O
his O
authority O
had O
never O
been O
disputed O
. O
" O
My O
God O
! O

he O
said O
; O

silently O
handed O
his O

CHAPTER O
I O
I O
ON O
a O
hill O
by O
the O
Mississippi O
where O
Chippewas PROP_PER
camped O
two O
generations O
ago O
, O
a NOM_PER
girl NOM_PER
stood O
in O
relief O
against O
the O
cornflower O
blue O
of O
Northern O
sky O
. O
She PRON_PER
saw O
no NOM_PER
Indians NOM_PER
now O
; O
she PRON_PER
saw O
flour-mills O
and O
the O
blinking O
windows O
of O
skyscrapers O
in O
Minneapolis O
and O
St. O
Paul O
. O
Nor O
was O
she PRON_PER
thinking O
of O
squaws NOM_PER
and O
portages O
, O
and O
the NOM_PER
Yankee NOM_PER
fur-traders NOM_PER
whose NOM_PER
shadows NOM_PER
were NOM_PER
all NOM_PER
about NOM_PER
her NOM_PER
. O
She O
was O
meditating O
upon O
walnut O
fudge O
, O
the O
plays O
of O
Brieux O
, O
the O
reasons O
why O
heels O
run O
over O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
chemistry O
instructor O
had O
stared O
at O
the O
new O
coiffure O
which O
concealed O
her O
ears O
. O
A O
breeze O
which O
had O
crossed O
a O
thousand O
miles O
of O
wheat-lands O
bellied O
her O
taffeta O
skirt O
in O
a O
line O
so O
graceful O
, O
so O
full O
of O
animation O
and O
moving O
beauty O
, O
that O
the O
heart O
of O
a O
chance O
watcher O
on O
the O
lower O
road O
tightened O
to O
wistfulness O
over O
her O
quality O
of O
suspended O
freedom O
. O
She O
lifted O
her O
arms O
, O
she O
leaned O
back O
against O
the O
wind O
, O
her O
skirt O
dipped O
and O
flared O
, O
a O
lock O
blew O
wild O
. O
A O
girl O
on O
a O
hilltop O
; O
credulous O
, O
plastic O
, O
young O
; O
drinking O
the O
air O
as O
she O
longed O
to O
drink O
life O
. O
The O
eternal O
aching O
comedy O
of O
expectant O
youth O
. O
It O
is O
Carol O
Milford O
, O
fleeing O
for O
an O
hour O
from O
Blodgett O
College O
. O
The O
days O
of O
pioneering O
, O
of O
lassies O
in O
sunbonnets O
, O
and O
bears O
killed O
with O
axes O
in O
piney O
clearings O
, O
are O
deader O
now O
than O
Camelot O
; O
and O
a O
rebellious O
girl O
is O
the O
spirit O
of O
that O
bewildered O
empire O
called O
the O
American O
Middlewest O
. O
II O
Blodgett O
College O
is O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
Minneapolis O
. O
It O
is O
a O
bulwark O
of O
sound O
religion O
. O
It O
is O
still O
combating O
the O
recent O
heresies O
of O
Voltaire O
, O
Darwin O
, O
and O
Robert O
Ingersoll O
. O
Pious O
families O
in O
Minnesota O
, O
Iowa O
, O
Wisconsin O
, O
the O
Dakotas O
send O
their O
children O
thither O
, O
and O
Blodgett O
protects O
them O
from O
the O
wickedness O
of O
the O
universities O
. O
But O
it O
secretes O
friendly O
girls O
, O
young O
men O
who O
sing O
, O
and O
one O
lady O
instructress O
who O
really O
likes O
Milton O
and O
Carlyle O
. O
So O
the O
four O
years O
which O
Carol O
spent O
at O
Blodgett O
were O
not O
altogether O
wasted O
. O
The O
smallness O
of O
the O
school O
, O
the O
fewness O
of O
rivals O
, O
permitted O
her O
to O
experiment O
with O
her O
perilous O
versatility O
. O
She O
played O
tennis O
, O
gave O
chafing-dish O
parties O
, O
took O
a O
graduate O
seminar O
in O
the O
drama O
, O
went O
" O
twosing O
, O
" O
and O
joined O
half O
a O
dozen O
societies O
for O
the O
practise O
of O
the O
arts O
or O
the O
tense O
stalking O
of O
a O
thing O
called O
General O
Culture O
. O
In O
her O
class O
there O
were O
two O
or O
three O
prettier O
girls O
, O
but O
none O
more O
eager O
. O
She O
was O
noticeable O
equally O
in O
the O
classroom O
grind O
and O
at O
dances O
, O
though O
out O
of O
the O
three O
hundred O
students O
of O
Blodgett O
, O
scores O
recited O
more O
accurately O
and O
dozens O
Bostoned O
more O
smoothly O
. O
Every O
cell O
of O
her O
body O
was O
alive O
-- O
thin O
wrists O
, O
quince-blossom O
skin O
, O
ingenue O
eyes O
, O
black O
hair O
. O
The O
other O
girls O
in O
her O
dormitory O
marveled O
at O
the O
slightness O
of O
her O
body O
when O
they O
saw O
her O
in O
sheer O
negligee O
, O
or O
darting O
out O
wet O
from O
a O
shower-bath O
. O
She O
seemed O
then O
but O
half O
as O
large O
as O
they O
had O
supposed O
; O
a O
fragile O
child O
who O
must O
be O
cloaked O
with O
understanding O
kindness O
. O
" O
Psychic O
, O
" O
the O
girls O
whispered O
, O
and O
" O
spiritual O
. O
" O
Yet O
so O
radioactive O
were O
her O
nerves O
, O
so O
adventurous O
her O
trust O
in O
rather O
vaguely O
conceived O
sweetness O
and O
light O
, O
that O
she O
was O
more O
energetic O
than O
any O
of O
the O
hulking O
young O
women O
who O
, O
with O
calves O
bulging O
in O
heavy-ribbed O
woolen O
stockings O
beneath O
decorous O
blue O
serge O
bloomers O
, O
thuddingly O
galloped O
across O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
" O
gym O
" O
in O
practise O
for O
the O
Blodgett O
Ladies O
’ O
Basket-Ball O
Team O
. O
Even O
when O
she O
was O
tired O
her O
dark O
eyes O
were O
observant O
. O
She O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
the O
immense O
ability O
of O
the O
world O
to O
be O
casually O
cruel O
and O
proudly O
dull O
, O
but O
if O
she O
should O
ever O
learn O
those O
dismaying O
powers O
, O
her O
eyes O
would O
never O
become O
sullen O
or O
heavy O
or O
rheumily O
amorous O
. O
For O
all O
her O
enthusiasms O
, O
for O
all O
the O
fondness O
and O
the O
" O
crushes O
" O
which O
she O
inspired O
, O
Carol O
’s O
acquaintances O
were O
shy O
of O
her O
. O
When O
she O
was O
most O
ardently O
singing O
hymns O
or O
planning O
deviltry O
she O
yet O
seemed O
gently O
aloof O
and O
critical O
. O
She O
was O
credulous O
, O
perhaps O
; O
a O
born O
hero-worshipper O
; O
yet O
she O
did O
question O
and O
examine O
unceasingly O
. O
Whatever O
she O
might O
become O
she O
would O
never O
be O
static O
. O
Her O
versatility O
ensnared O
her O
. O
By O
turns O
she O
hoped O
to O
discover O
that O
she O
had O
an O
unusual O
voice O
, O
a O
talent O
for O
the O
piano O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
act O
, O
to O
write O
, O
to O
manage O
organizations O
. O
Always O
she O
was O
disappointed O
, O
but O
always O
she O
effervesced O
anew O
-- O
over O
the O
Student O
Volunteers O
, O
who O
intended O
to O
become O
missionaries O
, O
over O
painting O
scenery O
for O
the O
dramatic O
club O
, O
over O
soliciting O
advertisements O
for O
the O
college O
magazine O
. O
She O
was O
on O
the O
peak O
that O
Sunday O
afternoon O
when O
she O
played O
in O
chapel O
. O
Out O
of O
the O
dusk O
her O
violin O
took O
up O
the O
organ O
theme O
, O
and O
the O
candle-light O
revealed O
her O
in O
a O
straight O
golden O
frock O
, O
her O
arm O
arched O
to O
the O
bow O
, O
her O
lips O
serious O
. O
Every O
man O
fell O
in O
love O
then O
with O
religion O
and O
Carol O
. O
Throughout O
Senior O
year O
she O
anxiously O
related O
all O
her O
experiments O
and O
partial O
successes O
to O
a O
career O
. O
Daily O
, O
on O
the O
library O
steps O
or O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
the O
Main O
Building O
, O
the O
co-eds O
talked O
of O
" O
What O
shall O
we O
do O
when O
we O
finish O
college O
? O
" O
Even O
the O
girls O
who O
knew O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
be O
married O
pretended O
to O
be O
considering O
important O
business O
positions O
; O
even O
they O
who O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
work O
hinted O
about O
fabulous O
suitors O
. O
As O
for O
Carol O
, O
she O
was O
an O
orphan O
; O
her O
only O
near O
relative O
was O
a O
vanilla-flavored O
sister O
married O
to O
an O
optician O
in O
St. O
Paul O
. O
She O
had O
used O
most O
of O
the O
money O
from O
her O
father O
’s O
estate O
. O
She O
was O
not O
in O
love O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
not O
often O
, O
nor O
ever O
long O
at O
a O
time O
. O
She O
would O
earn O
her O
living O
. O
But O
how O
she O
was O
to O
earn O
it O
, O
how O
she O
was O
to O
conquer O
the O
world O
-- O
almost O
entirely O
for O
the O
world O
’s O
own O
good O
-- O
she O
did O
not O
see O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
girls O
who O
were O
not O
betrothed O
meant O
to O
be O
teachers O
. O
Of O
these O
there O
were O
two O
sorts O
: O
careless O
young O
women O
who O
admitted O
that O
they O
intended O
to O
leave O
the O
" O
beastly O
classroom O
and O
grubby O
children O
" O
the O
minute O
they O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
marry O
; O
and O
studious O
, O
sometimes O
bulbous-browed O
and O
pop-eyed O
maidens O
who O
at O
class O
prayer-meetings O
requested O
God O
to O
" O
guide O
their O
feet O
along O
the O
paths O
of O
greatest O
usefulness O
. O
" O
Neither O
sort O
tempted O
Carol O
. O
The O
former O
seemed O
insincere O
( O
a O
favorite O
word O
of O
hers O
at O
this O
era O
) O
. O
The O
earnest O
virgins O
were O
, O
she O
fancied O
, O
as O
likely O
to O
do O
harm O
as O
to O
do O
good O
by O
their O
faith O
in O
the O
value O
of O
parsing O
Caesar O
. O
At O
various O
times O
during O
Senior O
year O
Carol O
finally O
decided O
upon O
studying O
law O
, O
writing O
motion-picture O
scenarios O
, O
professional O
nursing O
, O
and O
marrying O
an O
unidentified O
hero O
. O
Then O
she O
found O
a O
hobby O
in O
sociology O
. O
The O
sociology O
instructor O
was O
new O
. O
He O
was O
married O
, O
and O
therefore O
taboo O
, O
but O
he O
had O
come O
from O
Boston O
, O
he O
had O
lived O
among O
poets O
and O
socialists O
and O
Jews O
and O
millionaire O
uplifters O
at O
the O
University O
Settlement O
in O
New O
York O
, O
and O
he O
had O
a O
beautiful O
white O
strong O
neck O
. O
He O
led O
a O
giggling O
class O
through O
the O
prisons O
, O
the O
charity O
bureaus O
, O
the O
employment O
agencies O
of O
Minneapolis O
and O
St. O
Paul O
. O
Trailing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
Carol O
was O
indignant O
at O
the O
prodding O
curiosity O
of O
the O
others O
, O
their O
manner O
of O
staring O
at O
the O
poor O
as O
at O
a O
Zoo O
. O
She O
felt O
herself O
a O
great O
liberator O
. O
She O
put O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
mouth O
, O
her O
forefinger O
and O
thumb O
quite O
painfully O
pinching O
her O
lower O
lip O
, O
and O
frowned O
, O
and O
enjoyed O
being O
aloof O
. O
A O
classmate O
named O
Stewart O
Snyder O
, O
a O
competent O
bulky O
young O
man O
in O
a O
gray O
flannel O
shirt O
, O
a O
rusty O
black O
bow O
tie O
, O
and O
the O
green-and-purple O
class O
cap O
, O
grumbled O
to O
her O
as O
they O
walked O
behind O
the O
others O
in O
the O
muck O
of O
the O
South O
St. O
Paul O
stockyards O
, O
" O
These O
college O
chumps O
make O
me O
tired O

They O
’re O
so O
top-lofty O

I O

in O

The O

She O
had O
picked O
it O
up O
carelessly O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
yawn O
which O
she O
patted O
down O
with O
her O
finger-tips O
as O
delicately O
as O
a O
cat O
. O
She O
dipped O
into O
the O
book O

lounging O
on O
her O
window-seat O

with O
her O
slim O

lisle-stockinged O

up O

She O
stroked O
a O

the O

exuberance O
of O

Shockingly O
out O

a O

It O
was O
the O
only O

She O
had O

she O
suddenly O

CHAPTER O
I O
In O
the O
days O
when O
the O
spinning-wheels O
hummed O
busily O
in O
the O
farmhouses O
-- O
and O
even O
great NOM_PER
ladies NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
clothed NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
silk NOM_PER
and NOM_PER
thread-lace NOM_PER
, O
had O
their PRON_PER
toy O
spinning-wheels O
of O
polished O
oak O
-- O
there O
might O
be O
seen O
in O
districts O
far O
away O
among O
the O
lanes O
, O
or O
deep O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
the O
hills O
, O
certain NOM_PER
pallid NOM_PER
undersized NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
by NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
side NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
brawny NOM_PER
country-folk NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
looked NOM_PER
like NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
remnants NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
disinherited NOM_PER
race NOM_PER
. O
The O
shepherd O
's O
dog O
barked O
fiercely O
when O
one O
of O
these O
alien-looking O
men O
appeared O
on O
the O
upland O
, O
dark O
against O
the O
early O
winter O
sunset O
; O
for O
what O
dog O
likes O
a O
figure O
bent O
under O
a O
heavy O
bag O
? O
-- O
and O
these O
pale O
men O
rarely O
stirred O
abroad O
without O
that O
mysterious O
burden O
. O
The O
shepherd O
himself O
, O
though O
he O
had O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
bag O
held O
nothing O
but O
flaxen O
thread O
, O
or O
else O
the O
long O
rolls O
of O
strong O
linen O
spun O
from O
that O
thread O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
sure O
that O
this O
trade O
of O
weaving O
, O
indispensable O
though O
it O
was O
, O
could O
be O
carried O
on O
entirely O
without O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O
In O
that O
far-off O
time O
superstition O
clung O
easily O
round O
every O
person O
or O
thing O
that O
was O
at O
all O
unwonted O
, O
or O
even O
intermittent O
and O
occasional O
merely O
, O
like O
the O
visits O
of O
the O
pedlar O
or O
the O
knife-grinder O
. O
No O
one O
knew O
where O
wandering O
men O
had O
their O
homes O
or O
their O
origin O
; O
and O
how O
was O
a O
man O
to O
be O
explained O
unless O
you O
at O
least O
knew O
somebody O
who O
knew O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
? O
To O
the O
peasants O
of O
old O
times O
, O
the O
world O
outside O
their O
own O
direct O
experience O
was O
a O
region O
of O
vagueness O
and O
mystery O
: O
to O
their O
untravelled O
thought O
a O
state O
of O
wandering O
was O
a O
conception O
as O
dim O
as O
the O
winter O
life O
of O
the O
swallows O
that O
came O
back O
with O
the O
spring O
; O
and O
even O
a O
settler O
, O
if O
he O
came O
from O
distant O
parts O
, O
hardly O
ever O
ceased O
to O
be O
viewed O
with O
a O
remnant O
of O
distrust O
, O
which O
would O
have O
prevented O
any O
surprise O
if O
a O
long O
course O
of O
inoffensive O
conduct O
on O
his O
part O
had O
ended O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
a O
crime O
; O
especially O
if O
he O
had O
any O
reputation O
for O
knowledge O
, O
or O
showed O
any O
skill O
in O
handicraft O
. O
All O
cleverness O
, O
whether O
in O
the O
rapid O
use O
of O
that O
difficult O
instrument O
the O
tongue O
, O
or O
in O
some O
other O
art O
unfamiliar O
to O
villagers O
, O
was O
in O
itself O
suspicious O
: O
honest O
folk O
, O
born O
and O
bred O
in O
a O
visible O
manner O
, O
were O
mostly O
not O
overwise O
or O
clever O
-- O
at O
least O
, O
not O
beyond O
such O
a O
matter O
as O
knowing O
the O
signs O
of O
the O
weather O
; O
and O
the O
process O
by O
which O
rapidity O
and O
dexterity O
of O
any O
kind O
were O
acquired O
was O
so O
wholly O
hidden O
, O
that O
they O
partook O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
conjuring O
. O
In O
this O
way O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
that O
those O
scattered O
linen-weavers O
-- O
emigrants O
from O
the O
town O
into O
the O
country O
-- O
were O
to O
the O
last O
regarded O
as O
aliens O
by O
their O
rustic O
neighbours O
, O
and O
usually O
contracted O
the O
eccentric O
habits O
which O
belong O
to O
a O
state O
of O
loneliness O
. O
In O
the O
early O
years O
of O
this O
century O
, O
such O
a O
linen-weaver O
, O
named O
Silas O
Marner O
, O
worked O
at O
his O
vocation O
in O
a O
stone O
cottage O
that O
stood O
among O
the O
nutty O
hedgerows O
near O
the O
village O
of O
Raveloe O
, O
and O
not O
far O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
deserted O
stone-pit O
. O
The O
questionable O
sound O
of O
Silas O
's O
loom O
, O
so O
unlike O
the O
natural O
cheerful O
trotting O
of O
the O
winnowing-machine O
, O
or O
the O
simpler O
rhythm O
of O
the O
flail O
, O
had O
a O
half-fearful O
fascination O
for O
the O
Raveloe O
boys O
, O
who O
would O
often O
leave O
off O
their O
nutting O
or O
birds O
' O
- O
nesting O
to O
peep O
in O
at O
the O
window O
of O
the O
stone O
cottage O
, O
counterbalancing O
a O
certain O
awe O
at O
the O
mysterious O
action O
of O
the O
loom O
, O
by O
a O
pleasant O
sense O
of O
scornful O
superiority O
, O
drawn O
from O
the O
mockery O
of O
its O
alternating O
noises O
, O
along O
with O
the O
bent O
, O
tread-mill O
attitude O
of O
the O
weaver O
. O
But O
sometimes O
it O
happened O
that O
Marner O
, O
pausing O
to O
adjust O
an O
irregularity O
in O
his O
thread O
, O
became O
aware O
of O
the O
small O
scoundrels O
, O
and O
, O
though O
chary O
of O
his O
time O
, O
he O
liked O
their O
intrusion O
so O
ill O
that O
he O
would O
descend O
from O
his O
loom O
, O
and O
, O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
would O
fix O
on O
them O
a O
gaze O
that O
was O
always O
enough O
to O
make O
them O
take O
to O
their O
legs O
in O
terror O
. O
For O
how O
was O
it O
possible O
to O
believe O
that O
those O
large O
brown O
protuberant O
eyes O
in O
Silas O
Marner O
's O
pale O
face O
really O
saw O
nothing O
very O
distinctly O
that O
was O
not O
close O
to O
them O
, O
and O
not O
rather O
that O
their O
dreadful O
stare O
could O
dart O
cramp O
, O
or O
rickets O
, O
or O
a O
wry O
mouth O
at O
any O
boy O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
the O
rear O
? O
They O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
heard O
their O
fathers O
and O
mothers O
hint O
that O
Silas O
Marner O
could O
cure O
folks O
' O
rheumatism O
if O
he O
had O
a O
mind O
, O
and O
add O
, O
still O
more O
darkly O
, O
that O
if O
you O
could O
only O
speak O
the O
devil O
fair O
enough O
, O
he O
might O
save O
you O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
doctor O
. O
Such O
strange O
lingering O
echoes O
of O
the O
old O
demon-worship O
might O
perhaps O
even O
now O
be O
caught O
by O
the O
diligent O
listener O
among O
the O
grey-haired O
peasantry O
; O
for O
the O
rude O
mind O
with O
difficulty O
associates O
the O
ideas O
of O
power O
and O
benignity O
. O
A O
shadowy O
conception O
of O
power O
that O
by O
much O
persuasion O
can O
be O
induced O
to O
refrain O
from O
inflicting O
harm O
, O
is O
the O
shape O
most O
easily O
taken O
by O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
Invisible O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
men O
who O
have O
always O
been O
pressed O
close O
by O
primitive O
wants O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
a O
life O
of O
hard O
toil O
has O
never O
been O
illuminated O
by O
any O
enthusiastic O
religious O
faith O
. O
To O
them O
pain O
and O
mishap O
present O
a O
far O
wider O
range O
of O
possibilities O
than O
gladness O
and O
enjoyment O
: O
their O
imagination O
is O
almost O
barren O
of O
the O
images O
that O
feed O
desire O
and O
hope O
, O
but O
is O
all O
overgrown O
by O
recollections O
that O
are O
a O
perpetual O
pasture O
to O
fear O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
anything O
you O
can O
fancy O
that O
you O
would O
like O
to O
eat O
? O
" O
I O
once O
said O
to O
an O
old O
labouring O
man O
, O
who O
was O
in O
his O
last O
illness O
, O
and O
who O
had O
refused O
all O
the O
food O
his O
wife O
had O
offered O
him O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
, O
" O
I O
've O
never O
been O
used O
to O
nothing O
but O
common O
victual O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
eat O
that O
. O
" O
Experience O
had O
bred O
no O
fancies O
in O
him O
that O
could O
raise O
the O
phantasm O
of O
appetite O
. O
And O
Raveloe O
was O
a O
village O
where O
many O
of O
the O
old O
echoes O
lingered O
, O
undrowned O
by O
new O
voices O
. O
Not O
that O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those O
barren O
parishes O
lying O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
civilization O
-- O
inhabited O
by O
meagre O
sheep O
and O
thinly-scattered O
shepherds O
: O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
lay O
in O
the O
rich O
central O
plain O
of O
what O
we O
are O
pleased O
to O
call O
Merry O
England O
, O
and O
held O
farms O
which O
, O
speaking O
from O
a O
spiritual O
point O
of O
view O
, O
paid O
highly-desirable O
tithes O
. O
But O
it O
was O
nestled O
in O
a O
snug O
well-wooded O
hollow O
, O
quite O
an O
hour O
's O
journey O
on O
horseback O
from O
any O
turnpike O
, O
where O
it O
was O
never O
reached O
by O
the O
vibrations O
of O
the O
coach-horn O
, O
or O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O
It O
was O
an O
important-looking O
village O
, O
with O
a O
fine O
old O
church O
and O
large O
churchyard O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
it O
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
large O
brick-and-stone O
homesteads O
, O
with O
well-walled O
orchards O
and O
ornamental O
weathercocks O
, O
standing O
close O
upon O
the O
road O
, O
and O
lifting O
more O
imposing O
fronts O
than O
the O
rectory O
, O
which O
peeped O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
churchyard O
: O
-- O
a O
village O
which O
showed O
at O
once O
the O
summits O
of O
its O
social O
life O
, O
and O
told O
the O
practised O
eye O
that O
there O
was O
no O
great O
park O
and O
manor-house O
in O
the O
vicinity O
, O
but O
that O
there O
were O
several O
chiefs O
in O
Raveloe O
who O
could O
farm O
badly O
quite O
at O
their O
ease O
, O
drawing O
enough O
money O
from O
their O
bad O
farming O
, O
in O
those O
war O
times O
, O
to O
live O
in O
a O
rollicking O
fashion O
, O
and O
keep O
a O
jolly O
Christmas O
, O
Whitsun O
, O
and O
Easter O
tide O
. O
It O
was O
fifteen O
years O
since O
Silas O
Marner O
had O
first O
come O
to O
Raveloe O
; O
he O
was O
then O
simply O
a O
pallid O
young O
man O
, O
with O
prominent O
short-sighted O
brown O
eyes O
, O
whose O
appearance O
would O
have O
had O
nothing O
strange O
for O
people O
of O
average O
culture O
and O
experience O
, O
but O
for O
the O
villagers O
near O
whom O
he O
had O
come O
to O
settle O
it O
had O
mysterious O
peculiarities O
which O
corresponded O
with O
the O
exceptional O
nature O
of O
his O
occupation O
, O
and O
his O
advent O
from O
an O
unknown O
region O
called O
" O
North O
' O
ard O
" O
. O
So O
had O
his O
way O
of O
life O
: O
-- O
he O
invited O
no O
comer O
to O
step O
across O
his O
door-sill O
, O
and O
he O
never O
strolled O
into O
the O
village O
to O
drink O
a O
pint O
at O
the O
Rainbow O
, O
or O
to O
gossip O
at O
the O
wheelwright O
's O
: O
he O
sought O
no O
man O
or O
woman O
, O
save O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
his O
calling O
, O
or O
in O
order O
to O
supply O
himself O
with O
necessaries O
; O
and O
it O
was O
soon O
clear O
to O
the O
Raveloe O
lasses O
that O
he O
would O
never O
urge O
one O
of O
them O
to O
accept O
him O
against O
her O
will O
-- O
quite O
as O
if O
he O
had O
heard O
them O
declare O
that O
they O
would O
never O
marry O
a O
dead O
man O
come O
to O
life O
again O
. O
This O
view O
of O
Marner O
's O
personality O
was O
not O
without O
another O
ground O
than O
his O
pale O
face O
and O
unexampled O
eyes O
; O
for O
Jem O
Rodney O
, O
the O
mole-catcher O
, O
averred O
that O
one O
evening O
as O
he O
was O
returning O
homeward O
, O
he O
saw O
Silas O
Marner O
leaning O
against O
a O
stile O
with O
a O
heavy O
bag O
on O
his O
back O
, O
instead O
of O
resting O
the O
bag O
on O
the O
stile O
as O
a O
man O
in O
his O
senses O
would O
have O
done O
; O
and O
that O
, O
on O
coming O
up O
to O
him O
, O
he O
saw O
that O
Marner O
's O
eyes O
were O
set O
like O
a O
dead O
man O
's O
, O
and O
he O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O
and O
shook O
him O
, O
and O
his O
limbs O
were O
stiff O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
clutched O
the O
bag O
as O
if O
they O
'd O
been O
made O
of O
iron O
; O
but O
just O
as O
he O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
the O
weaver O
was O
dead O
, O
he O
came O
all O
right O
again O
, O
like O
, O
as O
you O
might O
say O
, O
in O
the O
winking O
of O
an O
eye O
, O
and O
said O
" O
Good-night O
" O
, O
and O
walked O
off O
. O
All O
this O
Jem O
swore O
he O
had O
seen O
, O
more O
by O
token O
that O
it O
was O
the O
very O
day O
he O
had O
been O
mole-catching O
on O
Squire O
Cass O
's O
land O
, O
down O
by O
the O
old O
saw-pit O
. O
Some O
said O
Marner O
must O
have O
been O
in O
a O
" O
fit O
" O
, O
a O
word O
which O
seemed O
to O
explain O
things O
otherwise O
incredible O
; O
but O
the O
argumentative O
Mr. O
Macey O
, O
clerk O
of O
the O
parish O
, O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
anybody O
was O
ever O
known O
to O
go O
off O
in O
a O
fit O
and O
not O
fall O
down O
. O
A O
fit O
was O
a O
stroke O
, O
was O
n't O
it O
? O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
stroke O
to O
partly O
take O
away O
the O
use O
of O
a O
man O
's O
limbs O
and O
throw O
him O
on O
the O
parish O
, O
if O
he O
'd O
got O
no O
children O
to O
look O
to O
. O
No O
, O
no O
; O
it O
was O
no O
stroke O
that O
would O
let O
a O
man O
stand O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
like O
a O
horse O
between O
the O
shafts O
, O
and O
then O
walk O
off O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
say O
" O
Gee O
! O
" O
But O
there O
might O
be O
such O
a O
thing O
as O
a O
man O
's O
soul O
being O
loose O
from O
his O
body O
, O
and O
going O
out O
and O
in O
, O
like O
a O
bird O
out O
of O
its O
nest O
and O
back O
; O
and O
that O
was O
how O
folks O
got O
over-wise O
, O
for O
they O
went O
to O
school O
in O
this O
shell-less O
state O
to O
those O
who O
could O
teach O
them O
more O
than O
their O
neighbours O
could O
learn O
with O
their O
five O
senses O
and O
the O
parson O
. O
And O
where O
did O
Master O
Marner O
get O
his O
knowledge O
of O
herbs O
from O
-- O
and O
charms O
too O
, O
if O
he O
liked O
to O
give O
them O
away O
? O
Jem O
Rodney O
's O
story O
was O
no O
more O
than O
what O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
by O
anybody O
who O
had O
seen O
how O
Marner O
had O
cured O
Sally O
Oates O
, O
and O
made O
her O
sleep O
like O
a O
baby O
, O
when O
her O
heart O
had O
been O
beating O
enough O
to O
burst O
her O
body O
, O
for O
two O
months O
and O
more O
, O
while O
she O
had O
been O
under O
the O
doctor O
's O
care O
. O
He O
might O
cure O
more O
folks O
if O
he O
would O
; O
but O
he O
was O
worth O
speaking O
fair O
, O
if O
it O
was O
only O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
doing O
you O
a O
mischief O
. O

In O
Miss O

an O

poor O

trotted O
off O

for O
whom O
Miss O

had O
done O

quite O
enough O

, O
child O
, O
wife O
, O
or O
husband O
; O
who O
actually O
DOES O
leave O
a O
disconsolate O
family O
to O
mourn O
his O
loss O
; O
so O
in O
academies O
of O
the O
male O
and O
female O
sex O
it O
occurs O
every O
now O
and O
then O
that O
the O
pupil O
is O
fully O
worthy O
of O
the O
praises O
bestowed O
by O
the O
disinterested O
instructor O
. O
Now O
, O
Miss O
Amelia O
Sedley O
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
this O
singular O
species O
; O
and O
deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss O
Pinkerton O
said O
in O
her O
praise O
, O
but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O
old O
Minerva O
of O
a O
woman O
could O
not O
see O
, O
from O
the O
differences O
of O
rank O
and O
age O
between O
her O
pupil O
and O
herself O
. O
For O
she O
could O
not O
only O
sing O
like O
a O
lark O
, O
or O
a O
Mrs. O
Billington O
, O
and O
dance O
like O
Hillisberg O
or O
Parisot O
; O
and O
embroider O
beautifully O
; O
and O
spell O
as O
well O
as O
a O
Dixonary O
itself O
; O
but O
she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O
, O
smiling O
, O
tender O
, O
gentle O
, O
generous O
heart O
of O
her O
own O
, O
as O
won O
the O
love O
of O
everybody O
who O
came O
near O
her O
, O
from O
Minerva O
herself O
down O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
in O
the O
scullery O
, O
and O
the O
one-eyed O
tart-woman O
's O
daughter O
, O
who O
was O
permitted O
to O
vend O
her O
wares O
once O
a O
week O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
Mall O
. O
She O
had O
twelve O
intimate O
and O
bosom O
friends O
out O
of O
the O
twenty-four O
young O
ladies O
. O
Even O
envious O
Miss O
Briggs O
never O
spoke O
ill O
of O
her O
; O
high O
and O
mighty O
Miss O
Saltire O
( O
Lord O
Dexter O
's O
granddaughter O
) O
allowed O
that O
her O
figure O
was O
genteel O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Miss O
Swartz O
, O
the O
rich O
woolly-haired O
mulatto O
from O
St. O
Kitt O
's O
, O
on O
the O
day O
Amelia O
went O
away O
, O
she O
was O
in O
such O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
that O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
send O
for O
Dr. O
Floss O
, O
and O
half O
tipsify O
her O
with O
salvolatile O
. O
Miss O
Pinkerton O
's O
attachment O
was O
, O
as O
may O
be O
supposed O
from O
the O
high O
position O
and O
eminent O
virtues O
of O
that O
lady O
, O
calm O
and O
dignified O
; O
but O
Miss O
Jemima O
had O
already O
whimpered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Amelia O
's O
departure O
; O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O
( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. O
Kitt O
's O
. O
Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
allowed O
to O
parlour-boarders O
. O
Honest O
Jemima O
had O
all O
the O
bills O
, O
and O
the O
washing O
, O
and O
the O
mending O
, O
and O
the O
puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
to O
superintend O
. O
But O
why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O
probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O
this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filigree O
iron O
gates O
are O
once O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
she O
and O
her O
awful O
sister O
will O
never O
issue O
therefrom O
into O
this O
little O
world O
of O
history O
. O
But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia O
, O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O
, O
at O
the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
dear O
little O
creature O
; O
and O
a O
great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O
novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O
latter O
especially O
) O
abound O
in O
villains O
of O
the O
most O
sombre O
sort O
, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O
for O
a O
constant O
companion O
so O
guileless O
and O
good-natured O
a O
person O
. O
As O
she O
is O
not O
a O
heroine O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
describe O
her O
person O
; O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
her O
nose O
was O
rather O
short O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
her O
cheeks O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
round O
and O
red O
for O
a O
heroine O
; O
but O
her O
face O
blushed O
with O
rosy O
health O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
with O
the O
freshest O
of O
smiles O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
which O
sparkled O
with O
the O
brightest O
and O
honestest O
good-humour O
, O
except O
indeed O
when O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
often O
; O
for O
the O
silly O
thing O
would O
cry O
over O
a O
dead O
canary-bird O
; O
or O
over O
a O
mouse O
, O
that O
the O
cat O
haply O
had O
seized O
upon O
; O
or O
over O
the O
end O
of O
a O
novel O
, O
were O
it O
ever O
so O
stupid O
; O
and O
as O
for O
saying O
an O
unkind O
word O
to O
her O
, O
were O
any O
persons O
hard-hearted O
enough O
to O
do O
so O
-- O
why O
, O
so O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
them O
. O
Even O
Miss O
Pinkerton O
, O
that O
austere O
and O
godlike O
woman O
, O
ceased O
scolding O
her O
after O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
though O
she O
no O
more O
comprehended O
sensibility O
than O
she O
did O
Algebra O
, O
gave O
all O
masters O
and O
teachers O
particular O
orders O
to O
treat O
Miss O
Sedley O
with O
the O
utmost O
gentleness O
, O
as O
harsh O
treatment O
was O
injurious O
to O
her O

LADY PROP_PER

TO O
THE O
REV. O

Howard O
Grove O
, O
Kent O
. O
CAN O
any O
thing O
, O
my NOM_PER
good NOM_PER
Sir NOM_PER
, O
be O
more O
painful O
to O
a O
friendly O
mind O
, O
than O
a O
necessity O
of O
communicating O
disagreeable O
intelligence O
? O
Indeed O
it O
is O
sometimes O
difficult O
to O
determine O
, O
whether O
the O
relator O
or O
the O
receiver O
of O
evil O
tidings O
is O
most O
to O
be O
pitied O
. O
I O
have O
just O
had O
a O
letter O
from O
Madame O
Duval O
; O
she O
is O
totally O
at O
a O
loss O
in O
what O
manner O
to O
behave O
; O
she O
seems O
desirous O
to O
repair O
the O
wrongs O
she O
has O
done O
, O
yet O
wishes O
the O
world O
to O
believe O
her O
blameless O
. O
She O
would O
fain O
cast O
upon O
another O
the O
odium O
of O
those O
misfortunes O
for O
which O
she O
alone O
is O
answerable O
. O
Her O
letter O
is O
violent O
, O
sometimes O
abusive O
, O
and O
that O
of O
you O
! O
- O
you O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
is O
under O
obligations O
which O
are O
greater O
even O
than O
her O
faults O
, O
but O
to O
whose O
advice O
she O
wickedly O
imputes O
all O
the O
sufferings O
of O
her O
much O
injured O
daughter O
, O
the O
late O
Lady O
Belmont O
. O
The O
chief O
purport O
of O
her O
writing O
I O
will O
acquaint O
you O
with O
; O
the O
letter O
itself O
is O
not O
worthy O
your O
notice O
. O
She O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
has O
, O
for O
many O
years O
past O
, O
been O
in O
continual O
expectation O
of O
making O
a O
journey O
to O
England O
, O
which O
prevented O
her O
writing O
for O
information O
concerning O
this O
melancholy O
subject O
, O
by O
giving O
her O
hopes O
of O
making O
personal O
inquiries O
; O
but O
family O
occurrences O
have O
still O
detained O
her O
in O
France O
, O
which O
country O
she O
now O
sees O
no O
prospect O
of O
quitting O
. O
She O
has O
, O
therefore O
, O
lately O
used O
her O
utmost O
endeavors O
to O
obtain O
a O
faithful O
account O
of O
whatever O
related O
to O
her O
ill-advised O
daughter O
; O
the O
result O
of O
which O
giving O
her O
some O
reason O
to O
apprehend O
, O
that O
, O
upon O
her O
death-bed O
, O
she O
bequeathed O
an O
infant O
orphan O
to O
the O
world O
, O
she O
most O
graciously O
says O
, O
that O
if O
you O
, O
with O
whom O
she O
understands O
the O
child O
is O
placed O
, O
will O
procure O
authentic O
proofs O
of O
its O
relationship O
to O
her O
, O
you O
may O
sent O
it O
to O
Paris O
, O
where O
she O
will O
properly O
provide O
for O
it O
. O
This O
woman O
is O
, O
undoubtedly O
, O
at O
length O
, O
self-convicted O
of O
her O
most O
unnatural O
behaviour O
; O
it O
is O
evident O
, O
from O
her O
writing O
, O
that O
she O
is O
still O
as O
vulgar O
and O
illiterate O
as O
when O
her O
first O
husband O
, O
Mr. O
Evelyn O
, O
had O
the O
weakness O
to O
marry O
her O
; O
nor O
does O
she O
at O
all O
apologize O
for O
addressing O
herself O
to O
me O
, O
though O
I O
was O
only O
once O
in O
her O
company O
. O
Her O
letter O
has O
excited O
in O
my O
daughter O
Mirvan O
, O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
be O
informed O
of O
the O
motives O
which O
induced O
Madame O
Duval O
to O
abandon O
the O
unfortunate O
Lady O
Belmont O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
a O
mother O
's O
protection O
was O
peculiarly O
necessary O
for O
her O
peace O
and O
her O
reputation O
. O
Notwithstanding O
I O
was O
personally O
acquainted O
with O
all O
the O
parties O
concerned O
in O
that O
affair O
, O
the O
subject O
always O
appeared O
of O
too O
delicate O
a O
nature O
to O
be O
spoken O
of O
with O
the O
principals O
; O
I O
can O
not O
, O
therefore O
, O
satisfy O
Mrs. O
Mirvan O
otherwise O
than O
by O
applying O
to O
you O
. O
By O
saying O
that O
you O
may O
send O
the O
child O
, O
Madame O
Duval O
aims O
at O
conferring O
, O
where O
she O
most O
owes O
obligation O
. O
I O
pretend O
not O
to O
give O
you O
advice O
; O
you O
, O
to O
whose O
generous O
protection O
this O
helpless O
orphan O
is O
indebted O
for O
every O
thing O
, O
are O
the O
best O
and O
only O
judge O
of O
what O
she O
ought O
to O
do O
; O
but O
I O
am O
much O
concerned O
at O
the O
trouble O
and O
uneasiness O
which O
this O
unworthy O
woman O
may O
occasion O
you O
. O
My O
daughter O
and O
my O
grandchild O
join O
with O
me O
in O
desiring O
to O
be O
most O
kindly O
remembered O
to O
the O
amiable O

they O

me O
remind O

that O
the O
annual O

LETTER O
II O
MR. O
VILLARS O
TO O
LADY O
HOWARD O
Berry O
Hill O
, O
Dorsetshire O
. O
YOUR O
Ladyship O
did O
but O
too O
well O
foresee O
the O
perplexity O
and O
uneasiness O
of O
which O
Madame O
Duval O
's O
letter O
has O
been O
productive O
. O
However O
, O
I O
ought O
rather O
to O
be O
thankful O
that O
I O
have O
so O
many O
years O
remained O
unmolested O
, O
than O
repine O
at O
my O
present O
embarrassment O
; O
since O
it O
proves O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
this O
wretched O
woman O
is O
at O
length O
awakened O
to O
remorse O
. O
In O
regard O
to O
my O
answer O
, O
I O
must O
humbly O
request O
your O
Ladyship O
to O
write O
to O
this O
effect O
: O
" O
That O
I O
would O
not O
, O
upon O
any O
account O
, O
intentionally O
offend O
Madame O
Duval O
; O
but O
that O
I O
have O
weighty O
, O
nay O
unanswerable O
reasons O
for O
detaining O
her O
grand-daughter O
at O
present O
in O
England O
; O
the O
principal O
of O
which O
is O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
earnest O
desire O
of O
one O
to O
whose O
will O
she O
owes O
implicit O
duty O
. O
Madame O
Duval O
may O
be O
assured O
, O
that O
she O
meets O
with O
the O
utmost O
attention O
and O
tenderness O
; O
that O
her O
education O
, O
however O
short O
of O
my O
wishes O
, O
almost O
exceeds O
my O
abilities O
; O
and O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
when O
the O
time O
arrives O
that O
she O
shall O
pay O
her O
duty O
to O
her O
grand-mother O
, O
Madame O
Duval O
will O
find O
no O
reason O
to O
be O
dissatisfied O
with O
what O
has O
been O
done O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Your O
Ladyship O
will O
not O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
be O
surprised O
at O
this O
answer O
. O
Madame O
Duval O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
proper O
companion O
or O
guardian O
for O
a O
young O
woman O
: O
she O
is O
at O
once O
uneducated O
and O
unprincipled O
; O
ungentle O
in O
temper O
, O
and O
unamiable O
in O
her O
manners O
. O
I O
have O
long O
known O
that O
she O
has O
persuaded O
herself O
to O
harbour O
an O
aversion O
for O
me-Unhappy O
woman O
! O
I O
can O
only O
regard O
her O
as O
an O
object O
of O
pity O
! O
I O
dare O
not O
hesitate O
at O
a O
request O
from O
Mrs. O
Mirvan O
; O
yet O
, O
in O
complying O
with O
it O
, O
I O
shall O
, O
for O
her O
own O
sake O
, O
be O
as O
concise O
as O
I O
possibly O
can O
; O
since O
the O
cruel O
transactions O
which O
preceded O
the O
birth O
of O
my O
ward O
can O
afford O
no O
entertainment O
to O
a O
mind O
so O
humane O
as O
her O
's O
. O
Your O
Ladyship O
may O
probably O
have O
heard O
, O
that O
I O
had O
the O
honour O
to O
accompany O
Mr. O
Evelyn O
, O
the O
grandfather O
of O
my O
young O
charge O
, O
when O
upon O
his O
travels O
, O
in O
the O
capacity O
of O
a O
tutor O
. O
His O
unhappy O
marriage O
, O
immediately O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
England O
, O
with O
Madame O
Duval O
, O
then O
a O
waiting-girl O
at O
a O
tavern O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
advice O
and O
entreaties O
of O
all O
his O
friends O
, O
among O
whom O
I O
was O
myself O
the O
most O
urgent O
, O
induced O
him O
to O
abandon O
his O
native O
land O
, O
and O
fix O
his O
abode O
in O
France O
. O
Thither O
he O
was O
followed O
by O
shame O
and O
repentance O
; O
feelings O
which O
his O
heart O
was O
not O
framed O
to O
support O
; O
for O
, O
notwithstanding O
he O
had O
been O
too O
weak O
to O
resist O
the O
allurements O
of O
beauty O
, O
which O
nature O
, O
though O
a O
niggard O
to O
her O
of O
every O
other O
boon O
, O
had O
with O
a O
lavish O
hand O
bestowed O
on O
his O
wife O
; O
yet O
he O
was O
a O
young O
man O
of O
excellent O
character O
, O
and O
, O
till O
thus O
unaccountably O
infatuated O
, O
of O
unblemished O
conduct O
. O
He O
survived O
this O
ill-judged O
marriage O
but O
two O
years O
. O
Upon O
his O
death-bed O
, O
with O
an O
unsteady O
hand O
, O
he O
wrote O
me O
the O
following O
note O
: O

" O
Had O
my O
circumstances O
permitted O
me O
, O
I O
should O
have O
answered O
these O
words O
by O
an O
immediate O
journey O
to O
Paris O
; O
but O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
act O
by O
the O
agency O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
who O
was O
upon O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
present O
at O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
will O
. O
Mr. O
Evelyn O
left O
to O
me O
a O
legacy O
of O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
and O
the O
sole O
guardianship O
of O
his O
daughter O
's O
person O
till O
her O
eighteenth O
year O
; O
conjuring O
me O
, O
in O
the O
most O
affecting O
terms O
, O
to O
take O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
education O
till O
she O
was O
able O
to O
act O
with O
propriety O
for O
herself O
; O
but O
, O
in O
regard O
to O
fortune O
, O
he O
left O
her O
wholly O
dependent O
on O
her O
mother O
, O
to O
whose O
tenderness O
he O
earnestly O
recommended O
her O
. O
Thus O
, O
though O
he O
would O
not O
, O
to O
a O
woman O
low-bred O
and O
illiberal O
as O
Mrs. O
Evelyn O
, O
trust O
the O
conduct O
and O
morals O
of O
his O
daughter O
, O
he O
nevertheless O
thought O
proper O
to O
secure O
to O
her O
the O
respect O
and O
duty O
to O
which O
, O
from O
her O
own O
child O
, O
were O
certainly O
her O
due O
; O
but O
unhappily O
, O
it O
never O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
the O
mother O
, O
on O
her O
part O
, O
could O
fail O
in O
affection O
or O
justice O
. O
Miss O
Evelyn O
, O
Madam O
, O
from O
the O
second O
to O
the O
eighteenth O
year O
of O
her O
life O
, O
was O
brought O
up O
under O
my O
care O
, O
and O
, O
except O
when O
at O
school O
under O
my O
roof O
. O
I O
need O
not O
speak O
to O
your O
Ladyship O
of O
the O
virtues O
of O
that O
excellent O
young O
creature O
. O
She O
loved O
me O
as O
her O
father O
; O
nor O
was O
Mrs. O
Villars O
less O
valued O
by O
her O
; O
while O
to O
me O
she O
became O
so O
dear O
, O
that O
her O
loss O
was O
little O
less O
afflicting O
than O
that O
which O
I O
have O
since O
sustained O
of O
Mrs. O
Villars O
herself O
. O
At O
that O
period O
of O
her O
life O
we O
parted O
; O
her O
mother O
, O
then O
married O
to O
Monsieur O
Duval O
, O
sent O
for O
her O
to O
Paris O
. O
How O
often O
have O
I O
since O
regretted O
that O
I O
did O
not O
accompany O
her O
thither O
! O
Protected O
and O
supported O
by O
me O
, O
the O
misery O
and O
disgrace O
which O
awaited O
her O
might O
perhaps O
have O
been O
avoided O
. O
But O
, O
to O
be O
brief-Madame O
Duval O
, O
at O
the O
instigation O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
earnestly O
, O
or O
rather O
tyrannically O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
effect O
a O
union O
between O
Miss O
Evelyn O
and O
one O
of O
his O
nephews O
. O
And O
, O
when O
she O
found O
her O
power O
inadequate O
to O
her O
attempt O
, O
enraged O
at O
her O
non-compliance O
, O
she O
treated O
her O
with O
the O
grossest O
unkindness O
, O
and O
threatened O
her O
with O
poverty O
and O
ruin O
. O
Miss O
Evelyn O
, O
to O
whom O
wrath O
and O
violence O
had O
hitherto O
been O
strangers O
, O
soon O
grew O
weary O
of O
such O
usage O
; O
and O
rashly O
, O
and O
without O
a O
witness O
, O
consented O
to O
a O
private O
marriage O
with O
Sir O
John O
Belmont O
, O
a O
very O
profligate O
young O
man O
, O
who O
had O
but O
too O
successfully O
found O
means O
to O
insinuate O
himself O
into O
her O
favour O
. O
He O
promised O
to O
conduct O
her O
to O
England-he O
did.-O O
, O
Madam O
, O
you O
know O
the O
rest O
! O
- O
Disappointed O
of O
the O
fortune O
he O
expected O
, O
by O
the O
inexorable O
rancour O
of O
the O
Duvals O
, O
he O
infamously O
burnt O
the O
certificate O
of O
their O
marriage O
, O
and O
denied O
that O
they O
had O
ever O
been O
united O
. O
She O
flew O
to O
me O
for O
protection O
. O
With O
what O
mixed O
transports O
of O
joy O
and O
anguish O
did O
I O
again O
see O
her O
! O
By O
my O
advice O
, O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
procure O
proofs O
of O
her O
marriage-but O
in O
vain O
; O
her O
credulity O
had O
been O
no O
match O
for O
his O
art O
. O
Every O
body O
believed O
her O
innocent O
, O
from O
the O
guiltless O
tenor O
of O
her O
unspotted O
youth O
, O
and O
from O
the O
known O
libertinism O
of O
her O
barbarous O
betrayer O
. O
Yet O
her O
sufferings O
were O
too O
acute O
for O
her O
slender O
frame O
; O
and O
the O
same O
moment O
that O
gave O
birth O
to O
her O
infant O
, O
put O
an O
end O
at O
once O
to O
the O
sorrows O
and O
the O
life O
of O
its O
mother O
. O
The O
rage O
of O
Madame O
Duval O
at O
her O
elopement O
, O
abated O
not O
while O
this O
injured O
victim O
of O
cruelty O
yet O
drew O
breath O
. O
She O
probably O
intended O
, O
in O
time O
, O
to O
have O
pardoned O
her O
; O
but O
time O
was O
not O
allowed O
. O
When O
she O
was O
informed O
of O
her O
death O
, O
I O
have O
been O
told O
, O
that O
the O
agonies O
of O
grief O
and O
remorse O
, O
with O
which O
she O
was O
seized O
, O
occasioned O
her O
a O
severe O
fit O
of O
illness O
. O
But O
, O
from O
the O
time O
of O
her O
recovery O
to O
the O
date O
of O
her O
letter O
to O
your O
Ladyship O
, O
I O
had O
never O
heard O
that O
she O
manifested O
any O
desire O
to O
be O
made O
acquainted O
with O
the O
circumstances O
which O
attended O
the O
death O
of O
Lady O
Belmont O
, O
and O
the O
birth O
of O
her O
helpless O
child O

The O
hour O
, O
some O
little O
time O
before O
sunset O
, O
and O
the O
place O
, O
the O
West O
Barricade O
, O
at O
the O
very O
spot O
where O
, O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
a O
proud O
tyrant O
raised O
an O
undying O
monument O
to O
the O
nation O
's O
glory O
and O
his O
own O
vanity O
. O
During O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
day O
the O
guillotine O
had O
been O
kept O
busy O
at O
its O
ghastly O
work O
: O
all O
that O
France O
had O
boasted O
of O
in O
the O
past O
centuries O
, O
of O
ancient O
names O
, O
and O
blue O
blood O
, O
had O
paid O
toll O
to O
her O
desire O
for O
liberty O
and O
for O
fraternity O
. O
The O
carnage O
had O
only O
ceased O
at O
this O
late O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
because O
there O
were O
other O
more O
interesting O
sights O
for O
the O
people O
to O
witness O
, O
a O
little O
while O
before O
the O
final O
closing O
of O
the O
barricades O
for O
the O
night O
. O
And O
so O
the O
crowd O
rushed O
away O
from O
the O
Place O
de O
la O
Greve O
and O
made O
for O
the O
various O
barricades O
in O
order O
to O
watch O
this O
interesting O
and O
amusing O
sight O
. O
It O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
every O
day O
, O
for O
those O
aristos O
were O
such O
fools O
! O
They O
were O
traitors O
to O
the O
people O
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
them O
, O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
descendants O
of O
the O
great O
men O
who O
since O
the O
Crusades O
had O
made O
the O
glory O
of O
France O
: O
her O
old O
NOBLESSE O
. O
Their O
ancestors O
had O
oppressed O
the O
people O
, O
had O
crushed O
them O
under O
the O
scarlet O
heels O
of O
their O
dainty O
buckled O
shoes O
, O
and O
now O
the O
people O
had O
become O
the O
rulers O
of O
France O
and O
crushed O
their O
former O
masters O
-- O
not O
beneath O
their O
heel O
, O
for O
they O
went O
shoeless O
mostly O
in O
these O
days O
-- O
but O
a O
more O
effectual O
weight O
, O
the O
knife O
of O
the O
guillotine O
. O
And O
daily O
, O
hourly O
, O
the O
hideous O
instrument O
of O
torture O
claimed O
its O
many O
victims O
-- O
old O
men O
, O
young O
women O
, O
tiny O
children O
until O
the O
day O
when O
it O
would O
finally O
demand O
the O
head O
of O
a O
King O
and O
of O
a O
beautiful O
young O
Queen O
. O
But O
this O
was O
as O
it O
should O
be O
: O
were O
not O
the O
people O
now O
the O
rulers O
of O
France O
? O
Every O
aristocrat O
was O
a O
traitor O
, O
as O
his O
ancestors O
had O
been O
before O
him O
: O
for O
two O
hundred O
years O
now O
the O
people O
had O
sweated O
, O
and O
toiled O
, O
and O
starved O
, O
to O
keep O
a O
lustful O
court O
in O
lavish O
extravagance O
; O
now O
the O
descendants O
of O
those O
who O
had O
helped O
to O
make O
those O
courts O
brilliant O
had O
to O
hide O
for O
their O
lives O
-- O
to O
fly O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
to O
avoid O
the O
tardy O
vengeance O
of O
the O
people O
. O
And O
they O
did O
try O
to O
hide O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
fly O
: O
that O
was O
just O
the O
fun O
of O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
Every O
afternoon O
before O
the O
gates O
closed O
and O
the O
market O
carts O
went O
out O
in O
procession O
by O
the O
various O
barricades O
, O
some O
fool O
of O
an O
aristo O
endeavoured O
to O
evade O
the O
clutches O
of O
the O
Committee O
of O
Public O
Safety O
. O
In O
various O
disguises O
, O
under O
various O
pretexts O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
slip O
through O
the O
barriers O
, O
which O
were O
so O
well O
guarded O
by O
citizen O
soldiers O
of O
the O
Republic O
. O
Men O
in O
women O
's O
clothes O
, O
women O
in O
male O
attire O
, O
children O
disguised O
in O
beggars O
' O
rags O
: O
there O
were O
some O
of O
all O
sorts O
: O
CI-DEVANT O
counts O
, O
marquises O
, O
even O
dukes O
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
fly O
from O
France O
, O
reach O
England O
or O
some O
other O
equally O
accursed O
country O
, O
and O
there O
try O
to O
rouse O
foreign O
feelings O
against O
the O
glorious O
Revolution O
, O
or O
to O
raise O
an O
army O
in O
order O
to O
liberate O
the O
wretched O
prisoners O
in O
the O
Temple O
, O
who O
had O
once O
called O
themselves O
sovereigns O
of O
France O
. O
But O
they O
were O
nearly O
always O
caught O
at O
the O
barricades O
, O
Sergeant O
Bibot O
especially O
at O
the O
West O
Gate O
had O
a O
wonderful O
nose O
for O
scenting O
an O
aristo O
in O
the O
most O
perfect O
disguise O
. O
Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
fun O
began O
. O
Bibot O
would O
look O
at O
his O
prey O
as O
a O
cat O
looks O
upon O
the O
mouse O
, O
play O
with O
him O
, O
sometimes O
for O
quite O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
pretend O
to O
be O
hoodwinked O
by O
the O
disguise O
, O
by O
the O
wigs O
and O
other O
bits O
of O
theatrical O
make-up O
which O
hid O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
CI-DEVANT O
noble O
marquise O
or O
count O
. O
Oh O
! O
Bibot O
had O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
and O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
hanging O
round O
that O
West O
Barricade O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
him O
catch O
an O
aristo O
in O
the O
very O
act O
of O
trying O
to O
flee O
from O
the O
vengeance O
of O
the O
people O
. O
Sometimes O
Bibot O
would O
let O
his O
prey O
actually O
out O
by O
the O
gates O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
think O
for O
the O
space O
of O
two O
minutes O
at O
least O
that O
he O
really O
had O
escaped O
out O
of O
Paris O
, O
and O
might O
even O
manage O
to O
reach O
the O
coast O
of O
England O
in O
safety O
, O
but O
Bibot O
would O
let O
the O
unfortunate O
wretch O
walk O
about O
ten O
metres O
towards O
the O
open O
country O
, O
then O
he O
would O
send O
two O
men O
after O
him O
and O
bring O
him O
back O
, O
stripped O
of O
his O
disguise O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
was O
extremely O
funny O
, O
for O
as O
often O
as O
not O
the O
fugitive O
would O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
woman O
, O
some O
proud O
marchioness O
, O
who O
looked O
terribly O
comical O
when O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
Bibot O
's O
clutches O
after O
all O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
a O
summary O
trial O
would O
await O
her O
the O
next O
day O
and O
after O
that O
, O
the O
fond O
embrace O
of O
Madame O
la O
Guillotine O
. O
No O
wonder O
that O
on O
this O
fine O
afternoon O
in O
September O
the O
crowd O
round O
Bibot O
's O
gate O
was O
eager O
and O
excited O
. O
The O
lust O
of O
blood O
grows O
with O
its O
satisfaction O
, O
there O
is O
no O
satiety O
: O
the O
crowd O
had O
seen O
a O
hundred O
noble O
heads O
fall O
beneath O
the O
guillotine O
to-day O
, O
it O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
would O
see O
another O
hundred O
fall O
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
Bibot O
was O
sitting O
on O
an O
overturned O
and O
empty O
cask O
close O
by O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
barricade O
; O
a O
small O
detachment O
of O
citoyen O
soldiers O
was O
under O
his O
command O
. O
The O
work O
had O
been O
very O
hot O
lately O
. O
Those O
cursed O
aristos O
were O
becoming O
terrified O
and O
tried O
their O
hardest O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
Paris O
: O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
whose O
ancestors O
, O
even O
in O
remote O
ages O
, O
had O
served O
those O
traitorous O
Bourbons O
, O
were O
all O
traitors O
themselves O
and O
right O
food O
for O
the O
guillotine O
. O
Every O
day O
Bibot O
had O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
unmasking O
some O
fugitive O
royalists O
and O
sending O
them O
back O
to O
be O
tried O
by O
the O
Committee O
of O
Public O
Safety O
, O
presided O
over O
by O
that O
good O
patriot O
, O
Citoyen O
Foucquier-Tinville O
. O
Robespierre O
and O
Danton O
both O
had O
commended O
Bibot O
for O
his O
zeal O
and O
Bibot O
was O
proud O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
on O
his O
own O
initiative O
had O
sent O
at O
least O
fifty O
aristos O
to O
the O
guillotine O
. O
But O
to-day O
all O
the O
sergeants O
in O
command O
at O
the O
various O
barricades O
had O
had O
special O
orders O
. O
Recently O
a O
very O
great O
number O
of O
aristos O
had O
succeeded O
in O
escaping O
out O
of O
France O
and O
in O
reaching O
England O
safely O
. O
There O
were O
curious O
rumours O
about O
these O
escapes O
; O
they O
had O
become O
very O
frequent O
and O
singularly O
daring O
; O
the O
people O
's O
minds O
were O
becoming O
strangely O
excited O
about O
it O
all O
. O
Sergeant O
Grospierre O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
guillotine O
for O
allowing O
a O
whole O
family O
of O
aristos O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
the O
North O
Gate O
under O
his O
very O
nose O
. O
It O
was O
asserted O
that O
these O
escapes O
were O
organised O
by O
a O
band O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
whose O
daring O
seemed O
to O
be O
unparalleled O
, O
and O
who O
, O
from O
sheer O
desire O
to O
meddle O
in O
what O
did O
not O
concern O
them O
, O
spent O
their O
spare O
time O
in O
snatching O
away O
lawful O
victims O
destined O
for O
Madame O
la O
Guillotine O
. O
These O
rumours O
soon O
grew O
in O
extravagance O
; O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
this O
band O
of O
meddlesome O
Englishmen O
did O
exist O
; O
moreover O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
a O
man O
whose O
pluck O
and O
audacity O
were O
almost O
fabulous O
. O
Strange O
stories O
were O
afloat O
of O
how O
he O
and O
those O
aristos O
whom O
he O
rescued O
became O
suddenly O
invisible O
as O
they O
reached O
the O
barricades O
and O
escaped O
out O
of O
the O
gates O
by O
sheer O
supernatural O
agency O
. O
No O
one O
had O
seen O
these O
mysterious O
Englishmen O
; O
as O
for O
their O
leader O
, O
he O
was O
never O
spoken O
of O
, O
save O
with O
a O
superstitious O
shudder O
. O
Citoyen O
Foucquier-Tinville O
would O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
receive O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
from O
some O
mysterious O
source O
; O
sometimes O
he O
would O
find O
it O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
at O
others O
it O
would O
be O
handed O
to O
him O
by O
someone O
in O
the O
crowd O
, O
whilst O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
sitting O
of O
the O
Committee O
of O
Public O
Safety O
. O
The O
paper O
always O
contained O
a O
brief O
notice O
that O
the O
band O
of O
meddlesome O
Englishmen O
were O
at O
work O
, O
and O
it O
was O
always O
signed O
with O
a O
device O
drawn O
in O
red O
-- O
a O
little O
star-shaped O
flower O
, O
which O
we O
in O
England O
call O
the O
Scarlet O
Pimpernel O
. O
Within O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
the O
receipt O
of O
this O
impudent O
notice O
, O
the O
citoyens O
of O
the O
Committee O
of O
Public O
Safety O
would O
hear O
that O
so O
many O
royalists O
and O
aristocrats O
had O
succeeded O
in O
reaching O
the O
coast O
, O
and O
were O
on O
their O
way O
to O
England O
and O
safety O
. O
The O
guards O
at O
the O
gates O
had O
been O
doubled O
, O
the O
sergeants O
in O
command O
had O
been O
threatened O
with O
death O
, O
whilst O
liberal O
rewards O
were O
offered O
for O
the O
capture O
of O
these O
daring O
and O
impudent O
Englishmen O
. O
There O
was O
a O
sum O
of O
five O
thousand O
francs O
promised O
to O
the O
man O
who O
laid O
hands O
on O
the O
mysterious O
and O
elusive O
Scarlet O
Pimpernel O
. O
Everyone O
felt O
that O
Bibot O
would O
be O
that O
man O
, O
and O
Bibot O
allowed O
that O
belief O
to O
take O
firm O
root O
in O
everybody O
's O
mind O
; O
and O
so O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
people O
came O
to O
watch O
him O
at O
the O
West O
Gate O
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
present O
when O
he O
laid O
hands O
on O
any O
fugitive O
aristo O
who O
perhaps O
might O
be O
accompanied O
by O
that O
mysterious O
Englishman O
. O
" O
Bah O
! O
" O
he O
said O
to O
his O
trusted O
corporal O
, O
" O
Citoyen O
Grospierre O
was O
a O
fool O
! O
Had O
it O
been O
me O
now O
, O
at O
that O
North O
Gate O
last O
week O
. O
. O
. O
" O
Citoyen O
Bibot O
spat O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
express O
his O
contempt O
for O
his O
comrade O
's O
stupidity O
. O
" O
How O
did O
it O
happen O
, O
citoyen O
? O
" O
asked O
the O
corporal O
. O
" O
Grospierre O
was O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
keeping O
good O
watch O
, O
" O
began O
Bibot O
, O
pompously O
, O
as O
the O
crowd O
closed O
in O
round O
him O
, O
listening O
eagerly O
to O
his O
narrative O
. O
" O
We O
've O
all O
heard O
of O
this O
meddlesome O
Englishman O
, O
this O
accursed O
Scarlet O
Pimpernel O
. O
He O
wo O
n't O
get O
through O
MY O
gate O
, O
MORBLEU O
! O
unless O
he O
be O
the O
devil O
himself O
. O
But O
Grospierre O
was O
a O
fool O
. O
The O
market O
carts O
were O
going O
through O
the O
gates O
; O
there O
was O
one O
laden O
with O
casks O
, O
and O
driven O
by O
an O
old O
man O
, O
with O
a O
boy O
beside O
him O
. O
Grospierre O
was O
a O
bit O
drunk O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
himself O
very O
clever O
; O
he O
looked O
into O
the O
casks O
-- O
most O
of O
them O
, O
at O
least O
-- O
and O
saw O
they O
were O
empty O
, O
and O
let O
the O
cart O
go O
through O
. O
" O
A O
murmur O
of O
wrath O
and O
contempt O
went O
round O
the O
group O
of O
ill-clad O
wretches O
, O
who O
crowded O
round O
Citoyen O
Bibot O
. O
" O
Half O
an O
hour O
later O
, O

continued O
the O
sergeant O

" O
up O

A O

CHAPTER O
I O
ON O
THE O
ARIZONA O
HILLS O
I PRON_PER
am O
a NOM_PER
very NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
; O
how O
old O
I PRON_PER
do O
not O
know O
. O
Possibly O
I PRON_PER
am O
a O
hundred O
, O
possibly O
more O
; O
but O
I PRON_PER
can O
not O
tell O
because O
I PRON_PER
have O
never O
aged O
as O
other NOM_PER
men NOM_PER
, O
nor O
do O
I PRON_PER
remember O
any O
childhood O
. O
So O
far O
as O
I PRON_PER
can O
recollect O
I PRON_PER
have O
always O
been O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
, O
a NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
about NOM_PER
thirty NOM_PER
. O
I PRON_PER
appear O
today O
as O
I PRON_PER
did O
forty O
years O
and O
more O
ago O
, O
and O
yet O
I PRON_PER
feel O
that O
I PRON_PER
can O
not O
go O
on O
living O
forever O
; O
that O
some O
day O
I PRON_PER
shall O
die O
the O
real O
death O
from O
which O
there O
is O
no O
resurrection O
. O
I PRON_PER
do O
not O
know O
why O
I PRON_PER
should O
fear O
death O
, O
I PRON_PER
who O
have O
died O
twice O
and O
am O
still O
alive O
; O
but O
yet O
I PRON_PER
have O
the O
same O
horror O
of O
it O
as O
you NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
have NOM_PER
never NOM_PER
died NOM_PER
, O
and O
it O
is O
because O
of O
this O
terror O
of O
death O
, O
I PRON_PER
believe O
, O
that O
I PRON_PER
am O
so O
convinced O
of O
my PRON_PER
mortality O
. O
And O
because O
of O
this O
conviction O
I PRON_PER
have O
determined O
to O
write O
down O
the O
story O
of O
the O
interesting O
periods O
of O
my PRON_PER
life O
and O
of O
my PRON_PER
death O
. O
I PRON_PER
can O
not O
explain O
the O
phenomena O
; O
I PRON_PER
can O
only O
set O
down O
here O
in O
the O
words O
of O
an NOM_PER
ordinary NOM_PER
soldier NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
fortune NOM_PER
a O
chronicle O
of O
the O
strange O
events O
that O
befell O
me PRON_PER
during O
the O
ten O
years O
that O
my NOM_PER
dead NOM_PER
body NOM_PER
lay O
undiscovered O
in O
an O
Arizona O
cave O
. O
I O
have O
never O
told O
this O
story O
, O
nor O
shall O
mortal O
man O
see O
this O
manuscript O
until O
after O
I O
have O
passed O
over O
for O
eternity O
. O
I O
know O
that O
the O
average O
human O
mind O
will O
not O
believe O
what O
it O
can O
not O
grasp O
, O
and O
so O
I O
do O
not O
purpose O
being O
pilloried O
by O
the O
public O
, O
the O
pulpit O
, O
and O
the O
press O
, O
and O
held O
up O
as O
a O
colossal O
liar O
when O
I O
am O
but O
telling O
the O
simple O
truths O
which O
some O
day O
science O
will O
substantiate O
. O
Possibly O
the O
suggestions O
which O
I O
gained O
upon O
Mars O
, O
and O
the O
knowledge O
which O
I O
can O
set O
down O
in O
this O
chronicle O
, O
will O
aid O
in O
an O
earlier O
understanding O
of O
the O
mysteries O
of O
our O
sister O
planet O
; O
mysteries O
to O
you O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
mysteries O
to O
me O
. O
My O
name O
is O
John O
Carter O
; O
I O
am O
better O
known O
as O
Captain O
Jack O
Carter O
of O
Virginia O
. O
At O
the O
close O
of O
the O
Civil O
War O
I O
found O
myself O
possessed O
of O
several O
hundred O
thousand O
dollars O
( O
Confederate O
) O
and O
a O
captain O
's O
commission O
in O
the O
cavalry O
arm O
of O
an O
army O
which O
no O
longer O
existed O
; O
the O
servant O
of O
a O
state O
which O
had O
vanished O
with O
the O
hopes O
of O
the O
South O
. O
Masterless O
, O
penniless O
, O
and O
with O
my O
only O
means O
of O
livelihood O
, O
fighting O
, O
gone O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
work O
my O
way O
to O
the O
southwest O
and O
attempt O
to O
retrieve O
my O
fallen O
fortunes O
in O
a O
search O
for O
gold O
. O
I O
spent O
nearly O
a O
year O
prospecting O
in O
company O
with O
another O
Confederate O
officer O
, O
Captain O
James O
K. O
Powell O
of O
Richmond O
. O
We O
were O
extremely O
fortunate O
, O
for O
late O
in O
the O
winter O
of O
1865 O
, O
after O
many O
hardships O
and O
privations O
, O
we O
located O
the O
most O
remarkable O
gold-bearing O
quartz O
vein O
that O
our O
wildest O
dreams O
had O
ever O
pictured O
. O
Powell O
, O
who O
was O
a O
mining O
engineer O
by O
education O
, O
stated O
that O
we O
had O
uncovered O
over O
a O
million O
dollars O
worth O
of O
ore O
in O
a O
trifle O
over O
three O
months O
. O
As O
our O
equipment O
was O
crude O
in O
the O
extreme O
we O
decided O
that O
one O
of O
us O
must O
return O
to O
civilization O
, O
purchase O
the O
necessary O
machinery O
and O
return O
with O
a O
sufficient O
force O
of O
men O
properly O
to O
work O
the O
mine O
. O
As O
Powell O
was O
familiar O
with O
the O
country O
, O
as O
well O
as O
with O
the O
mechanical O
requirements O
of O
mining O
we O
determined O
that O
it O
would O
be O
best O
for O
him O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
. O
It O
was O
agreed O
that O
I O
was O
to O
hold O
down O
our O
claim O
against O
the O
remote O
possibility O
of O
its O
being O
jumped O
by O
some O
wandering O
prospector O
. O
On O
March O
3 O
, O
1866 O
, O
Powell O
and O
I O
packed O
his O
provisions O
on O
two O
of O
our O
burros O
, O
and O
bidding O
me O
good-bye O
he O
mounted O
his O
horse O
, O
and O
started O
down O
the O
mountainside O
toward O
the O
valley O
, O
across O
which O
led O
the O
first O
stage O
of O
his O
journey O
. O
The O
morning O
of O
Powell O
's O
departure O
was O
, O
like O
nearly O
all O
Arizona O
mornings O
, O
clear O
and O
beautiful O
; O
I O
could O
see O
him O
and O
his O
little O
pack O
animals O
picking O
their O
way O
down O
the O
mountainside O
toward O
the O
valley O
, O
and O
all O
during O
the O
morning O
I O
would O
catch O
occasional O
glimpses O
of O
them O
as O
they O
topped O
a O
hog O
back O
or O
came O
out O
upon O
a O
level O
plateau O
. O
My O
last O
sight O
of O
Powell O
was O
about O
three O
in O
the O
afternoon O
as O
he O
entered O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
range O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
. O
Some O
half O
hour O
later O
I O
happened O
to O
glance O
casually O
across O
the O
valley O
and O
was O
much O
surprised O
to O
note O
three O
little O
dots O
in O
about O
the O
same O
place O
I O
had O
last O
seen O
my O
friend O
and O
his O
two O
pack O
animals O
. O
I O
am O
not O
given O
to O
needless O
worrying O
, O
but O
the O
more O
I O
tried O
to O
convince O
myself O
that O
all O
was O
well O
with O
Powell O
, O
and O
that O
the O
dots O
I O
had O
seen O
on O
his O
trail O
were O
antelope O
or O
wild O
horses O
, O
the O
less O
I O
was O
able O
to O
assure O
myself O
. O
Since O
we O
had O
entered O
the O
territory O
we O
had O
not O
seen O
a O
hostile O
Indian O
, O
and O
we O
had O
, O
therefore O
, O
become O
careless O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
and O
were O
wont O
to O
ridicule O
the O
stories O
we O
had O
heard O
of O
the O
great O
numbers O
of O
these O
vicious O
marauders O
that O
were O
supposed O
to O
haunt O
the O
trails O
, O
taking O
their O
toll O
in O
lives O
and O
torture O
of O
every O
white O
party O
which O
fell O
into O
their O
merciless O
clutches O
. O
Powell O
, O
I O
knew O
, O
was O
well O
armed O
and O
, O
further O
, O
an O
experienced O
Indian O
fighter O
; O
but O
I O
too O
had O
lived O
and O
fought O
for O
years O
among O
the O
Sioux O
in O
the O
North O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
that O
his O
chances O
were O
small O
against O
a O
party O
of O
cunning O
trailing O
Apaches O
. O
Finally O
I O
could O
endure O
the O
suspense O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
, O
arming O
myself O
with O
my O
two O
Colt O
revolvers O
and O
a O
carbine O
, O
I O
strapped O
two O
belts O
of O
cartridges O
about O
me O
and O
catching O
my O
saddle O
horse O
, O
started O
down O
the O
trail O
taken O
by O
Powell O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
reached O
comparatively O
level O
ground O
I O
urged O
my O
mount O
into O
a O
canter O
and O
continued O
this O
, O
where O
the O
going O
permitted O
, O
until O
, O
close O
upon O
dusk O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
point O
where O
other O
tracks O
joined O
those O
of O
Powell O
. O
They O
were O
the O
tracks O
of O
unshod O
ponies O
, O
three O
of O
them O
, O
and O
the O
ponies O
had O
been O
galloping O
. O
I O
followed O
rapidly O
until O
, O
darkness O
shutting O
down O
, O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
await O
the O
rising O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
and O
given O
an O
opportunity O
to O
speculate O
on O
the O
question O
of O
the O
wisdom O
of O
my O
chase O
. O
Possibly O
I O
had O
conjured O
up O
impossible O
dangers O
, O
like O
some O
nervous O
old O
housewife O
, O
and O
when O
I O
should O
catch O
up O
with O
Powell O
would O
get O
a O
good O
laugh O
for O
my O
pains O
. O
However O
, O
I O
am O
not O
prone O
to O
sensitiveness O
, O
and O
the O
following O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
duty O
, O
wherever O
it O
may O
lead O
, O
has O
always O
been O
a O
kind O
of O
fetich O
with O
me O
throughout O
my O
life O
; O
which O
may O
account O
for O
the O
honors O
bestowed O
upon O
me O
by O
three O
republics O
and O
the O
decorations O
and O
friendships O
of O
an O
old O
and O
powerful O
emperor O
and O
several O
lesser O
kings O
, O
in O
whose O
service O
my O
sword O
has O
been O
red O
many O
a O
time O
. O
About O
nine O
o'clock O
the O
moon O
was O
sufficiently O
bright O
for O
me O
to O
proceed O
on O
my O
way O
and O
I O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
following O
the O
trail O
at O
a O
fast O
walk O
, O
and O
in O
some O
places O
at O
a O
brisk O
trot O
until O
, O
about O
midnight O
, O
I O
reached O
the O
water O
hole O
where O
Powell O
had O
expected O
to O
camp O
. O
I O
came O
upon O
the O
spot O
unexpectedly O
, O
finding O
it O
entirely O
deserted O
, O
with O
no O
signs O
of O
having O
been O
recently O
occupied O
as O
a O
camp O
. O
I O
was O
interested O
to O
note O
that O
the O
tracks O
of O
the O
pursuing O
horsemen O
, O
for O
such O
I O
was O
now O
convinced O
they O
must O
be O
, O
continued O
after O
Powell O
with O
only O
a O
brief O
stop O
at O
the O
hole O
for O
water O
; O
and O
always O
at O
the O
same O
rate O
of O
speed O
as O
his O
. O
I O
was O
positive O
now O
that O
the O
trailers O
were O
Apaches O
and O
that O
they O
wished O
to O
capture O
Powell O
alive O
for O
the O
fiendish O
pleasure O
of O
the O
torture O
, O
so O
I O
urged O
my O
horse O
onward O
at O
a O
most O
dangerous O
pace O
, O
hoping O
against O
hope O
that O
I O
would O
catch O
up O
with O
the O
red O
rascals O
before O
they O
attacked O
him O
. O
Further O
speculation O
was O
suddenly O
cut O
short O
by O
the O
faint O
report O
of O
two O
shots O
far O
ahead O
of O
me O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
Powell O
would O
need O
me O
now O
if O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
instantly O
urged O
my O
horse O
to O
his O
topmost O
speed O
up O
the O
narrow O
and O
difficult O
mountain O
trail O
. O
I O
had O
forged O
ahead O
for O
perhaps O
a O
mile O
or O
more O
without O
hearing O
further O
sounds O
, O
when O
the O
trail O
suddenly O
debouched O
onto O
a O
small O
, O
open O
plateau O
near O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
pass O
. O
I O
had O
passed O
through O
a O
narrow O
, O
overhanging O
gorge O
just O
before O
entering O
suddenly O
upon O
this O
table O
land O
, O
and O
the O
sight O
which O
met O
my O
eyes O
filled O
me O
with O
consternation O
and O
dismay O
. O
The O
little O
stretch O
of O
level O
land O
was O
white O
with O
Indian O
tepees O
, O
and O
there O
were O
probably O
half O
a O
thousand O
red O
warriors O
clustered O
around O
some O
object O
near O
the O
center O
of O
the O
camp O
. O
Their O
attention O
was O
so O
wholly O
riveted O
to O
this O
point O
of O
interest O
that O
they O
did O
not O
notice O
me O
, O
and O
I O
easily O
could O
have O
turned O
back O
into O
the O
dark O
recesses O
of O
the O
gorge O
and O
made O
my O
escape O
with O
perfect O
safety O
. O
The O
fact O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
thought O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
me O
until O
the O
following O
day O
removes O
any O
possible O
right O
to O
a O
claim O
to O
heroism O
to O
which O
the O
narration O
of O
this O
episode O
might O
possibly O
otherwise O
entitle O
me O
. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
made O
of O
the O
stuff O
which O
constitutes O
heroes O
, O
because O
, O
in O
all O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
instances O
that O
my O
voluntary O
acts O
have O
placed O
me O
face O
to O
face O
with O
death O
, O
I O
can O
not O
recall O
a O
single O
one O
where O
any O
alternative O
step O
to O
that O
I O
took O
occurred O
to O
me O
until O
many O
hours O
later O
. O
My O
mind O
is O
evidently O
so O
constituted O
that O
I O
am O
subconsciously O
forced O
into O
the O
path O
of O
duty O
without O
recourse O
to O
tiresome O
mental O
processes O
. O
However O
that O
may O
be O
, O
I O
have O
never O
regretted O
that O
cowardice O
is O
not O
optional O
with O
me O
. O
In O
this O
instance O
I O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
positive O
that O
Powell O
was O
the O
center O
of O
attraction O
, O
but O
whether O
I O
thought O
or O
acted O
first O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
but O
within O
an O
instant O
from O
the O
moment O
the O
scene O
broke O
upon O
my O
view O
I O
had O
whipped O
out O
my O
revolvers O
and O
was O
charging O
down O
upon O
the O
entire O
army O
of O
warriors O
, O
shooting O
rapidly O
, O
and O
whooping O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
lungs O
. O
Singlehanded O
, O
I O
could O
not O
have O
pursued O
better O
tactics O
, O
for O
the O
red O
men O
, O
convinced O
by O
sudden O
surprise O
that O
not O
less O
than O
a O
regiment O
of O
regulars O
was O
upon O
them O
, O
turned O
and O
fled O
in O
every O
direction O
for O
their O
bows O
, O
arrows O
, O
and O
rifles O
. O
The O
view O
which O
their O
hurried O
routing O
disclosed O
filled O
me O
with O
apprehension O
and O
with O
rage O
. O
Under O
the O
clear O
rays O
of O
the O
Arizona O
moon O
lay O
Powell O
, O
his O
body O
fairly O
bristling O
with O
the O
hostile O
arrows O
of O
the O
braves O
. O
That O
he O
was O
already O
dead O
I O
could O
not O
but O
be O
convinced O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
his O
body O
from O
mutilation O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Apaches O
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
the O
man O
himself O
from O
death O
. O
Riding O
close O
to O
him O
I O
reached O
down O
from O
the O
saddle O
, O
and O
grasping O
his O
cartridge O
belt O
drew O
him O
up O
across O
the O
withers O
of O
my O
mount O
. O
A O
backward O
glance O
convinced O
me O
that O
to O
return O
by O
the O
way O
I O
had O
come O
would O
be O
more O
hazardous O
than O
to O
continue O
across O
the O
plateau O
, O
so O
, O
putting O
spurs O
to O
my O
poor O
beast O
, O
I O
made O
a O
dash O
for O
the O
opening O
to O
the O
pass O
which O
I O
could O
distinguish O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
the O
table O

CONTAINING O

OF O
THE O
BIRTH O

THE NOM_PER
FOUNDLING NOM_PER

IS O
NECESSARY O
OR O

The O
introduction O
to O
the O
work O
, O
or O
bill O
of O
fare O
to O
the O
feast O
. O
An NOM_PER
author NOM_PER
ought O
to O
consider O
himself PRON_PER
, O
not O
as O
a NOM_PER
gentleman NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
gives NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
private NOM_PER
or NOM_PER
eleemosynary NOM_PER
treat NOM_PER
, O
but O
rather O
as O
one NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
keeps NOM_PER
a NOM_PER
public NOM_PER
ordinary NOM_PER
, O
at O
which O
all NOM_PER
persons NOM_PER
are O
welcome O
for O
their PRON_PER
money O
. O
In O
the O
former O
case O
, O
it O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the NOM_PER
entertainer NOM_PER
provides O
what O
fare O
he PRON_PER
pleases O
; O
and O
though O
this O
should O
be O
very O
indifferent O
, O
and O
utterly O
disagreeable O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
his NOM_PER
company NOM_PER
, O
they O
must O
not O
find O
any O
fault O
; O
nay O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
good O
breeding O
forces O
them O
outwardly O
to O
approve O
and O
to O
commend O
whatever O
is O
set O
before O
them O
. O
Now O
the O
contrary O
of O
this O
happens O
to O
the O
master O
of O
an O
ordinary O
. O
Men O
who O
pay O
for O
what O
they O
eat O
will O
insist O
on O
gratifying O
their O
palates O
, O
however O
nice O
and O
whimsical O
these O
may O
prove O
; O
and O
if O
everything O
is O
not O
agreeable O
to O
their O
taste O
, O
will O
challenge O
a O
right O
to O
censure O
, O
to O
abuse O
, O
and O
to O
d O
-- O
n O
their O
dinner O
without O
controul O
. O
To O
prevent O
, O
therefore O
, O
giving O
offence O
to O
their O
customers O
by O
any O
such O
disappointment O
, O
it O
hath O
been O
usual O
with O
the O
honest O
and O
well-meaning O
host O
to O
provide O
a O
bill O
of O
fare O
which O
all O
persons O
may O
peruse O
at O
their O
first O
entrance O
into O
the O
house O
; O
and O
having O
thence O
acquainted O
themselves O
with O
the O
entertainment O
which O
they O
may O
expect O
, O
may O
either O
stay O
and O
regale O
with O
what O
is O
provided O
for O
them O
, O
or O
may O
depart O
to O
some O
other O
ordinary O
better O
accommodated O
to O
their O
taste O
. O
As O
we O
do O
not O
disdain O
to O
borrow O
wit O
or O
wisdom O
from O
any O
man O
who O
is O
capable O
of O
lending O
us O
either O
, O
we O
have O
condescended O
to O
take O
a O
hint O
from O
these O
honest O
victuallers O
, O
and O
shall O
prefix O
not O
only O
a O
general O
bill O
of O
fare O
to O
our O
whole O
entertainment O
, O
but O
shall O
likewise O
give O
the O
reader O
particular O
bills O
to O
every O
course O
which O
is O
to O
be O
served O
up O
in O
this O
and O
the O
ensuing O
volumes O
. O
The O
provision O
, O
then O
, O
which O
we O
have O
here O
made O
is O
no O
other O
than O
_ O
Human O
Nature O
_ O
. O
Nor O
do O
I O
fear O
that O
my O
sensible O
reader O
, O
though O
most O
luxurious O
in O
his O
taste O
, O
will O
start O
, O
cavil O
, O
or O
be O
offended O
, O
because O
I O
have O
named O
but O
one O
article O
. O
The O
tortoise O
-- O
as O
the O
alderman O
of O
Bristol O
, O
well O
learned O
in O
eating O
, O
knows O
by O
much O
experience O
-- O
besides O
the O
delicious O
calipash O
and O
calipee O
, O
contains O
many O
different O
kinds O
of O
food O
; O
nor O
can O
the O
learned O
reader O
be O
ignorant O
, O
that O
in O
human O
nature O
, O
though O
here O
collected O
under O
one O
general O
name O
, O
is O
such O
prodigious O
variety O
, O
that O
a O
cook O
will O
have O
sooner O
gone O
through O
all O
the O
several O
species O
of O
animal O
and O
vegetable O
food O
in O
the O
world O
, O
than O
an O
author O
will O
be O
able O
to O
exhaust O
so O
extensive O
a O
subject O
. O
An O
objection O
may O
perhaps O
be O
apprehended O
from O
the O
more O
delicate O
, O
that O
this O
dish O
is O
too O
common O
and O
vulgar O
; O
for O
what O
else O
is O
the O
subject O
of O
all O
the O
romances O
, O
novels O
, O
plays O
, O
and O
poems O
, O
with O
which O
the O
stalls O
abound O
? O
Many O
exquisite O
viands O
might O
be O
rejected O
by O
the O
epicure O
, O
if O
it O
was O
a O
sufficient O
cause O
for O
his O
contemning O
of O
them O
as O
common O
and O
vulgar O
, O
that O
something O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
most O
paltry O
alleys O
under O
the O
same O
name O
. O
In O
reality O
, O
true O
nature O
is O
as O
difficult O
to O
be O
met O
with O
in O
authors O
, O
as O
the O
Bayonne O
ham O
, O
or O
Bologna O
sausage O
, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
shops O
. O
But O
the O
whole O
, O
to O
continue O
the O
same O
metaphor O
, O
consists O
in O
the O
cookery O
of O
the O
author O
; O
for O
, O
as O
Mr O
Pope O
tells O
us O
-- O
" O
True O
wit O
is O
nature O
to O
advantage O
drest O
; O
What O
oft O
was O
thought O
, O
but O
ne'er O
so O
well O
exprest O
. O
" O
The O
same O
animal O
which O
hath O
the O
honour O
to O
have O
some O
part O
of O
his O
flesh O
eaten O
at O
the O
table O
of O
a O
duke O
, O
may O
perhaps O
be O
degraded O
in O
another O
part O
, O
and O
some O
of O
his O
limbs O
gibbeted O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
the O
vilest O
stall O
in O
town O
. O
Where O
, O
then O
, O
lies O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
food O
of O
the O
nobleman O
and O
the O
porter O
, O
if O
both O
are O
at O
dinner O
on O
the O
same O
ox O
or O
calf O
, O
but O
in O
the O
seasoning O
, O
the O
dressing O
, O
the O
garnishing O
, O
and O
the O
setting O
forth O
? O
Hence O
the O
one O
provokes O
and O
incites O
the O
most O
languid O
appetite O
, O
and O
the O
other O
turns O
and O
palls O
that O
which O
is O
the O
sharpest O
and O
keenest O
. O
In O
like O
manner O
, O
the O
excellence O
of O
the O
mental O
entertainment O
consists O
less O
in O
the O
subject O
than O
in O
the O
author O
's O
skill O
in O
well O
dressing O
it O
up O
. O
How O
pleased O
, O
therefore O
, O
will O
the O
reader O
be O
to O
find O
that O
we O
have O
, O
in O
the O
following O
work O
, O
adhered O
closely O
to O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
principles O
of O
the O
best O
cook O
which O
the O
present O
age O
, O
or O
perhaps O
that O
of O
Heliogabalus O
, O
hath O
produced O
. O
This O
great O
man O
, O
as O
is O
well O
known O
to O
all O
lovers O
of O
polite O
eating O
, O
begins O
at O
first O
by O
setting O
plain O
things O
before O
his O
hungry O
guests O
, O
rising O
afterwards O
by O
degrees O
as O
their O
stomachs O
may O
be O
supposed O
to O
decrease O
, O
to O
the O
very O
quintessence O
of O
sauce O
and O
spices O
. O
In O
like O
manner O
, O
we O
shall O
represent O
human O
nature O
at O
first O
to O
the O
keen O
appetite O
of O
our O
reader O
, O
in O
that O
more O
plain O
and O
simple O
manner O
in O
which O
it O
is O
found O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
shall O
hereafter O
hash O
and O
ragoo O
it O
with O
all O
the O
high O
French O
and O
Italian O
seasoning O
of O
affectation O
and O
vice O
which O
courts O
and O
cities O
afford O
. O
By O
these O
means O
, O
we O
doubt O
not O
but O
our O
reader O
may O
be O
rendered O
desirous O
to O
read O
on O
for O
ever O
, O
as O
the O
great O
person O
just O
above-mentioned O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
made O
some O
persons O
eat O
. O
Having O
premised O
thus O
much O
, O
we O
will O
now O
detain O
those O
who O
like O
our O
bill O
of O
fare O
no O
longer O
from O
their O
diet O
, O
and O
shall O
proceed O
directly O
to O
serve O
up O
the O
first O
course O
of O
our O
history O
for O
their O
entertainment O

Chapter O
ii O
. O
A O
short O
description O
of O
squire O
Allworthy O
, O
and O
a O
fuller O
account O
of O
Miss O
Bridget O
Allworthy O
, O
his O
sister O
. O
In O
that O
part O
of O
the O
western O
division O
of O
this O
kingdom O
which O
is O
commonly O
called O
Somersetshire O
, O
there O
lately O
lived O
, O
and O
perhaps O
lives O
still O
, O
a O
gentleman O
whose O
name O
was O
Allworthy O
, O
and O
who O
might O
well O
be O
called O
the O
favourite O
of O
both O
nature O
and O
fortune O
; O
for O
both O
of O
these O
seem O
to O
have O
contended O
which O
should O
bless O
and O
enrich O
him O
most O
. O
In O
this O
contention O
, O
nature O
may O
seem O
to O
some O
to O
have O
come O
off O
victorious O
, O
as O
she O
bestowed O
on O
him O
many O
gifts O
, O
while O
fortune O
had O
only O
one O
gift O
in O
her O
power O
; O
but O
in O
pouring O
forth O
this O
, O
she O
was O
so O
very O
profuse O
, O
that O
others O
perhaps O
may O
think O
this O
single O
endowment O
to O
have O
been O
more O
than O
equivalent O
to O
all O
the O
various O
blessings O
which O
he O
enjoyed O
from O
nature O
. O
From O
the O
former O
of O
these O
, O
he O
derived O
an O
agreeable O
person O
, O
a O
sound O
constitution O
, O
a O
solid O
understanding O
, O
and O
a O
benevolent O
heart O
; O
by O
the O
latter O
, O
he O
was O
decreed O
to O
the O
inheritance O
of O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
estates O
in O
the O
county O
. O
This O
gentleman O
had O
in O
his O
youth O
married O
a O
very O
worthy O
and O
beautiful O
woman O
, O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
extremely O
fond O
: O
by O
her O
he O
had O
three O
children O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
died O
in O
their O
infancy O
. O
He O
had O
likewise O
had O
the O
misfortune O
of O
burying O
this O
beloved O
wife O
herself O
, O
about O
five O
years O
before O
the O
time O
in O
which O
this O
history O
chuses O
to O
set O
out O
. O
This O
loss O
, O
however O
great O
, O
he O
bore O
like O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
and O
constancy O
, O
though O
it O
must O
be O
confest O
he O
would O
often O
talk O
a O
little O
whimsically O
on O
this O
head O
; O
for O
he O
sometimes O
said O
he O
looked O
on O
himself O
as O
still O
married O
, O
and O
considered O
his O
wife O
as O
only O
gone O
a O
little O
before O
him O
, O
a O
journey O
which O
he O
should O
most O
certainly O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
take O
after O
her O
; O
and O
that O
he O
had O
not O
the O
least O
doubt O
of O
meeting O
her O
again O
in O
a O
place O
where O
he O
should O
never O
part O
with O
her O
more O
-- O
sentiments O
for O
which O
his O
sense O
was O
arraigned O
by O
one O
part O
of O
his O
neighbours O
, O
his O
religion O
by O
a O
second O
, O
and O
his O
sincerity O
by O
a O
third O
. O
He O
now O
lived O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
retired O
in O
the O
country O
, O
with O
one O
sister O
, O
for O
whom O
he O
had O
a O
very O
tender O
affection O
. O
This O
lady O
was O
now O
somewhat O
past O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
an O
aera O
at O
which O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
malicious O
, O
the O
title O
of O
old O
maid O
may O
with O
no O
impropriety O
be O
assumed O
. O
She O
was O
of O
that O
species O
of O
women O
whom O
you O
commend O
rather O
for O
good O
qualities O
than O
beauty O
, O
and O
who O
are O
generally O
called O
, O
by O
their O
own O
sex O
, O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
women O
-- O
as O
good O
a O
sort O
of O
woman O
, O
madam O
, O
as O
you O
would O
wish O
to O
know O
. O
Indeed O
, O
she O
was O
so O
far O
from O
regretting O
want O
of O
beauty O
, O
that O
she O
never O
mentioned O
that O
perfection O
, O
if O
it O
can O
be O
called O
one O
, O
without O
contempt O
; O
and O
would O
often O
thank O
God O
she O
was O
not O
as O
handsome O
as O
Miss O
Such-a-one O
, O
whom O
perhaps O
beauty O
had O
led O
into O
errors O
which O
she O
might O
have O
otherwise O
avoided O
. O
Miss O
Bridget O
Allworthy O
( O
for O
that O
was O
the O
name O
of O
this O
lady O
) O
very O
rightly O
conceived O
the O
charms O
of O
person O
in O
a O
woman O
to O
be O
no O
better O
than O
snares O
for O
herself O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
others O
; O
and O
yet O
so O
discreet O
was O
she O
in O
her O
conduct O
, O
that O
her O
prudence O
was O
as O
much O
on O
the O
guard O
as O
if O
she O
had O
all O
the O
snares O
to O
apprehend O
which O
were O
ever O
laid O
for O
her O
whole O
sex O
. O
Indeed O
, O
I O
have O
observed O
, O
though O
it O
may O
seem O
unaccountable O
to O
the O
reader O
, O
that O
this O
guard O
of O
prudence O
, O
like O
the O
trained O
bands O
, O
is O
always O
readiest O
to O
go O
on O
duty O
where O
there O
is O
the O
least O
danger O
. O
It O
often O
basely O
and O
cowardly O
deserts O
those O
paragons O
for O
whom O
the O
men O
are O
all O
wishing O
, O
sighing O
, O
dying O
, O
and O
spreading O
every O
net O
in O
their O
power O
; O
and O
constantly O
attends O
at O
the O
heels O
of O
that O
higher O
order O
of O
women O
for O
whom O
the O
other O
sex O
have O
a O
more O
distant O
and O
awful O
respect O
, O
and O
whom O
( O
from O
despair O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
of O
success O
) O
they O
never O
venture O
to O
attack O
. O
Reader O
, O
I O
think O
proper O
, O
before O
we O
proceed O
any O
farther O
together O
, O
to O
acquaint O
thee O
that O
I O
intend O
to O
digress O
, O
through O
this O
whole O
history O
, O
as O
often O
as O
I O
see O
occasion O
, O
of O
which O
I O
am O
myself O
a O
better O
judge O
than O
any O
pitiful O
critic O
whatever O
; O
and O
here O
I O
must O
desire O
all O
those O
critics O
to O
mind O
their O
own O
business O
, O
and O
not O
to O
intermeddle O
with O
affairs O
or O
works O
which O
no O
ways O
concern O
them O
; O
for O
till O
they O
produce O
the O
authority O
by O
which O
they O
are O
constituted O
judges O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
plead O
to O
their O
jurisdiction O

An O
odd O
accident O
which O
befel O
Mr O
Allworthy O
at O
his O
return O
home O
. O
The O
decent O
behaviour O
of O
Mrs O
Deborah O
Wilkins O
, O
with O
some O
proper O
animadversions O
on O
bastards O
. O
I O
have O
told O
my O
reader O
, O
in O
the O
preceding O
chapter O
, O
that O
Mr O
Allworthy O
inherited O
a O
large O
fortune O
; O
that O
he O
had O
a O
good O
heart O
, O
and O
no O
family O
. O
Hence O
, O
doubtless O
, O
it O
will O
be O
concluded O
by O
many O
that O
he O
lived O
like O
an O
honest O
man O
, O
owed O
no O
one O
a O
shilling O
, O
took O
nothing O
but O
what O
was O
his O
own O
, O
kept O
a O
good O
house O
, O
entertained O
his O
neighbours O
with O
a O
hearty O
welcome O
at O
his O
table O
, O
and O
was O
charitable O
to O
the O
poor O
, O
i.e. O
to O
those O
who O
had O
rather O
beg O
than O
work O
, O
by O
giving O
them O
the O
offals O
from O
it O
; O
that O
he O
died O
immensely O
rich O
and O
built O
an O
hospital O

CHAPTER O
I O
THE NOM_PER
CONSUL NOM_PER
’S O
YARN O
A O
week O
had O
passed O
since O
the O
funeral O
of O
my O
poor O
boy O
Harry O
, O
and O
one O
evening O
I O
was O
in O
my O
room O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
and O
thinking O
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
ring O
at O
the O
outer O
door O
. O
Going O
down O
the O
steps O
I O
opened O
it O
myself O
, O
and O
in O
came O
my O
old O
friends O
Sir O
Henry O
Curtis O
and O
Captain O
John O
Good O
, O
RN O
. O
They O
entered O
the O
vestibule O
and O
sat O
themselves O
down O
before O
the O
wide O
hearth O
, O
where O
, O
I O
remember O
, O
a O
particularly O
good O
fire O
of O
logs O
was O
burning O
. O
‘ O
It O
is O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
come O
round O
, O
’ O
I O
said O
by O
way O
of O
making O
a O
remark O
; O
‘ O
it O
must O
have O
been O
heavy O
walking O
in O
the O
snow O
. O
’ O
They O
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
Sir O
Henry O
slowly O
filled O
his O
pipe O
and O
lit O
it O
with O
a O
burning O
ember O
. O
As O
he O
leant O
forward O
to O
do O
so O
the O
fire O
got O
hold O
of O
a O
gassy O
bit O
of O
pine O
and O
flared O
up O
brightly O
, O
throwing O
the O
whole O
scene O
into O
strong O
relief O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
, O
What O
a O
splendid-looking O
man O
he O
is O
! O
Calm O
, O
powerful O
face O
, O
clear-cut O
features O
, O
large O
grey O
eyes O
, O
yellow O
beard O
and O
hair O
-- O
altogether O
a O
magnificent O
specimen O
of O
the O
higher O
type O
of O
humanity O
. O
Nor O
did O
his O
form O
belie O
his O
face O
. O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
wider O
shoulders O
or O
a O
deeper O
chest O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Sir O
Henry O
’s O
girth O
is O
so O
great O
that O
, O
though O
he O
is O
six O
feet O
two O
high O
, O
he O
does O
not O
strike O
one O
as O
a O
tall O
man O
. O
As O
I O
looked O
at O
him O
I O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
what O
a O
curious O
contrast O
my O
little O
dried-up O
self O
presented O
to O
his O
grand O
face O
and O
form O
. O
Imagine O
to O
yourself O
a O
small O
, O
withered O
, O
yellow-faced O
man O
of O
sixty-three O
, O
with O
thin O
hands O
, O
large O
brown O
eyes O
, O
a O
head O
of O
grizzled O
hair O
cut O
short O
and O
standing O
up O
like O
a O
half-worn O
scrubbing-brush O
-- O
total O
weight O
in O
my O
clothes O
, O
nine O
stone O
six O
-- O
and O
you O
will O
get O
a O
very O
fair O
idea O
of O
Allan O
Quatermain O
, O
commonly O
called O
Hunter O
Quatermain O
, O
or O
by O
the O
natives O
‘ O
Macumazahn O
’ O
-- O
Anglicè O
, O
he O
who O
keeps O
a O
bright O
look-out O
at O
night O
, O
or O
, O
in O
vulgar O
English O
, O
a O
sharp O
fellow O
who O
is O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
in O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
Good O
, O
who O
is O
not O
like O
either O
of O
us O
, O
being O
short O
, O
dark O
, O
stout O
-- O
_ O
very O
_ O
stout O
-- O
with O
twinkling O
black O
eyes O
, O
in O
one O
of O
which O
an O
eyeglass O
is O
everlastingly O
fixed O
. O
I O
say O
stout O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
mild O
term O
; O
I O
regret O
to O
state O
that O
of O
late O
years O
Good O
has O
been O
running O
to O
fat O
in O
a O
most O
disgraceful O
way O
. O
Sir O
Henry O
tells O
him O
that O
it O
comes O
from O
idleness O
and O
over-feeding O
, O
and O
Good O
does O
not O
like O
it O
at O
all O
, O
though O
he O
can O
not O
deny O
it O
. O
We O
sat O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
then O
I O
got O
a O
match O
and O
lit O
the O
lamp O
that O
stood O
ready O
on O
the O
table O
, O
for O
the O
half-light O
began O
to O
grow O
dreary O
, O
as O
it O
is O
apt O
to O
do O
when O
one O
has O
a O
short O
week O
ago O
buried O
the O
hope O
of O
one O
’s O
life O
. O
Next O
, O
I O
opened O
a O
cupboard O
in O
the O
wainscoting O
and O
got O
a O
bottle O
of O
whisky O
and O
some O
tumblers O
and O
water O
. O
I O
always O
like O
to O
do O
these O
things O
for O
myself O
: O
it O
is O
irritating O
to O
me O
to O
have O
somebody O
continually O
at O
my O
elbow O
, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
an O
eighteen-month-old O
baby O
. O
All O
this O
while O
Curtis O
and O
Good O
had O
been O
silent O
, O
feeling O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
that O
they O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
that O
could O
do O
me O
any O
good O
, O
and O
content O
to O
give O
me O
the O
comfort O
of O
their O
presence O
and O
unspoken O
sympathy O
; O
for O
it O
was O
only O
their O
second O
visit O
since O
the O
funeral O
. O
And O
it O
is O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
from O
the O
_ O
presence O
_ O
of O
others O
that O
we O
really O
derive O
support O
in O
our O
dark O
hours O
of O
grief O
, O
and O
not O
from O
their O
talk O
, O
which O
often O
only O
serves O
to O
irritate O
us O
. O
Before O
a O
bad O
storm O
the O
game O
always O
herd O
together O
, O
but O
they O
cease O
their O
calling O
. O
They O
sat O
and O
smoked O
and O
drank O
whisky O
and O
water O
, O
and O
I O
stood O
by O
the O
fire O
also O
smoking O
and O
looking O
at O
them O
. O
At O
last O
I O
spoke O
. O
‘ O
Old O
friends O
, O
’ O
I O
said O
, O
‘ O
how O
long O
is O
it O
since O
we O
got O
back O
from O
Kukuanaland O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Three O
years O
, O
’ O
said O
Good O
. O
‘ O
Why O
do O
you O
ask O
? O
’ O
‘ O
I O
ask O
because O
I O
think O
that O
I O
have O
had O
a O
long O
enough O
spell O
of O
civilization O
. O
I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
the O
veldt O
. O
’ O
Sir O
Henry O
laid O
his O
head O
back O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
and O
laughed O
one O
of O
his O
deep O
laughs O
. O
‘ O
How O
very O
odd O
, O
’ O
he O
said O
, O
‘ O
eh O
, O
Good O
? O
’ O
Good O
beamed O
at O
me O
mysteriously O
through O
his O
eyeglass O
and O
murmured O
, O
‘ O
Yes O
, O
odd O
-- O
very O
odd O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
do O
n’t O
quite O
understand O
, O
’ O
said O
I O
, O
looking O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
for O
I O
dislike O
mysteries O
. O
‘ O
Do O
n’t O
you O
, O
old O
fellow O
? O
’ O
said O
Sir O
Henry O
; O
‘ O
then O
I O
will O
explain O
. O
As O
Good O
and O
I O
were O
walking O
up O
here O
we O
had O
a O
talk O
. O
’ O
‘ O
If O
Good O
was O
there O
you O
probably O
did O
, O
’ O
I O
put O
in O
sarcastically O
, O
for O
Good O
is O
a O
great O
hand O
at O
talking O
. O
‘ O
And O
what O
may O
it O
have O
been O
about O
? O
’ O
‘ O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
’ O
asked O
Sir O
Henry O
. O
I O
shook O
my O
head O
. O
It O
was O
not O
likely O
that O
I O
should O
know O
what O
Good O
might O
be O
talking O
about O
. O
He O
talks O
about O
so O
many O
things O
. O
‘ O
Well O
, O
it O
was O
about O
a O
little O
plan O
that O
I O
have O
formed O
-- O
namely O
, O
that O
if O
you O
were O
willing O
we O
should O
pack O
up O
our O
traps O
and O
go O
off O
to O
Africa O
on O
another O
expedition O
. O
’ O
I O
fairly O
jumped O
at O
his O
words O
. O
‘ O
You O
do O
n’t O
say O
so O
! O
’ O
I O
said O
. O
‘ O
Yes O
I O
do O
, O
though O
, O
and O
so O
does O
Good O
; O
do O
n’t O
you O
, O
Good O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Rather O
, O
’ O
said O
that O
gentleman O
. O
‘ O
Listen O
, O
old O
fellow O
, O
’ O
went O
on O
Sir O
Henry O
, O
with O
considerable O
animation O
of O
manner O
. O
‘ O
I O
’m O
tired O
of O
it O
too O
, O
dead-tired O
of O
doing O
nothing O
more O
except O
play O
the O
squire O
in O
a O
country O
that O
is O
sick O
of O
squires O
. O
For O
a O
year O
or O
more O
I O
have O
been O
getting O
as O
restless O
as O
an O
old O
elephant O
who O
scents O
danger O
. O
I O
am O
always O
dreaming O
of O
Kukuanaland O
and O
Gagool O
and O
King O
Solomon O
’s O
Mines O
. O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
I O
have O
become O
the O
victim O
of O
an O
almost O
unaccountable O
craving O
. O
I O
am O
sick O
of O
shooting O
pheasants O
and O
partridges O
, O

you O
know O
the O
feeling O

when O
one O
has O
once O
tasted O
brandy O

water O

milk O
becomes O
insipid O
to O
the O

That O
year O
we O
spent O
together O
up O
in O
Kukuanaland O
seems O
to O
me O
worth O
all O
the O
other O
years O
of O
my O
life O
put O
together O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
that O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
for O
my O
pains O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n’t O
help O
it O
; O
I O
long O
to O

, O
what O
is O
more O
, O
I O

to O
go O

He O
paused O

then O
went O
on O
again O

‘ O
And O
, O
after O
all O
, O
why O
should O
I O
not O

? O
I O
have O
no O

no O

child O

If O
anything O
happens O
to O
me O
the O
baronetcy O
will O
go O
to O
my O
brother O
George O

boy O

it O
would O

in O

‘ O
Ah O
! O

I O

I O
thought O
you O

now O
, O
Good O
, O
what O
is O
your O

you O

‘ O
I O
never O

What O
is O
it O
? O
’ O
I O
said O

‘ O
Well O
, O
if O
you O

rather O

up O

! O
’ O
said O
Sir O
Henry O
. O
‘ O
And O
now O
, O
Quatermain O
, O
tell O
us O
, O
where O
do O
you O
propose O
going O
to O
? O
’ O
I O
lit O
my O
pipe O
, O
which O
had O
gone O
out O
, O
before O
answering O
. O
‘ O
Have O
you O
people O
ever O
heard O
of O
Mt O
Kenia O
? O
’ O
I O
asked O
. O
‘ O
Do O
n’t O
know O
the O
place O
, O
’ O
said O
Good O
. O
‘ O
Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
of O
the O
Island O
of O
Lamu O
? O
’ O
I O
asked O
again O
. O
‘ O
No O
. O
Stop O
, O
though O
-- O
is O
n’t O
it O
a O
place O
about O
300 O
miles O
north O
of O
Zanzibar O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Yes O
. O
Now O
listen O
. O
What O
I O
have O
to O
propose O
is O
this O
. O
That O
we O
go O
to O
Lamu O
and O
thence O
make O
our O
way O
about O
250 O
miles O
inland O
to O
Mt O
Kenia O
; O
from O
Mt O
Kenia O
on O
inland O
to O
Mt O
Lekakisera O
, O
another O
200 O
miles O
, O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
beyond O
which O
no O
white O
man O
has O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
belief O
ever O
been O
; O
and O
then O
, O
if O
we O
get O
so O
far O
, O
right O
on O
into O
the O
unknown O
interior O
. O
What O
do O
you O
say O
to O
that O
, O
my O
hearties O
? O
’ O
‘ O
It O
’s O
a O
big O
order O
, O
’ O
said O
Sir O
Henry O
, O
reflectively O
. O
‘ O
You O
are O
right O
, O
’ O
I O
answered O
, O
‘ O
it O
is O
; O
but O
I O
take O
it O
that O
we O
are O
all O
three O
of O
us O
in O
search O
of O
a O
big O
order O
. O
We O
want O
a O
change O
of O
scene O
, O
and O
we O
are O
likely O
to O
get O
one O
-- O
a O
thorough O
change O
. O
All O
my O
life O
I O
have O
longed O
to O
visit O
those O
parts O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
to O
do O
it O
before O
I O
die O
. O
My O
poor O
boy O
’s O
death O
has O
broken O
the O
last O
link O
between O
me O
and O
civilization O
, O
and O
I O
’m O
off O
to O
my O
native O
wilds O
. O
And O
now O
I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
another O
thing O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
that O
for O
years O
and O
years O
I O
have O
heard O
rumours O
of O
a O
great O
white O
race O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
its O
home O
somewhere O
up O
in O
this O
direction O
, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
mind O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
truth O
in O
them O
. O
If O
you O
fellows O
like O
to O
come O
, O
well O
and O
good O
; O
if O
not O
, O
I O
’ll O
go O
alone O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
’m O
your O
man O
, O
though O
I O
do O
n’t O
believe O
in O
your O
white O
race O
, O

said O
Sir O
Henry O
Curtis O
, O
rising O
and O
placing O
his O
arm O
upon O
my O
shoulder O
. O
‘ O
Ditto O
, O
’ O
remarked O
Good O
. O
‘ O
I O
’ll O
go O
into O
training O
at O
once O
. O
By O
all O
means O
let O
’s O
go O
to O
Mt O
Kenia O
and O
the O
other O
place O
with O
an O
unpronounceable O
name O
, O
and O
look O
for O
a O
white O
race O
that O
does O
not O
exist O
. O
It O
’s O
all O
one O
to O
me O
. O
’ O
‘ O
When O
do O
you O
propose O
to O
start O
? O
’ O
asked O
Sir O
Henry O
. O
‘ O
This O
day O
month O

I O
answered O

‘ O

and O
do O
n’t O
you O
be O
so O
certain O
that O

no O

CHAPTER O
I O
TREATS O
OF O
THE O
PLACE O
WHERE O
OLIVER PROP_PER
TWIST PROP_PER
WAS O
BORN O
AND O
OF O
THE O
CIRCUMSTANCES O
ATTENDING O
HIS PRON_PER
BIRTH O
Among O
other O
public O
buildings O
in O
a O
certain O
town O
, O
which O
for O
many O
reasons O
it O
will O
be O
prudent O
to O
refrain O
from O
mentioning O
, O
and O
to O
which O
I PRON_PER
will O
assign O
no O
fictitious O
name O
, O
there O
is O
one O
anciently O
common O
to O
most O
towns O
, O
great O
or O
small O
: O
to O
wit O
, O
a O
workhouse O
; O
and O
in O
this O
workhouse O
was O
born O
; O
on O
a O
day O
and O
date O
which O
I PRON_PER
need O
not O
trouble O
myself PRON_PER
to O
repeat O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
can O
be O
of O
no O
possible O
consequence O
to O
the O
reader O
, O
in O
this O
stage O
of O
the O
business O
at O
all O
events O
; O
the O
item O
of O
mortality O
whose O
name O
is O
prefixed O
to O
the O
head O
of O
this O
chapter O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
after O
it PRON_PER
was O
ushered O
into O
this O
world O
of O
sorrow O
and O
trouble O
, O
by O
the NOM_PER
parish NOM_PER
surgeon NOM_PER
, O
it O
remained O
a O
matter O
of O
considerable O
doubt O
whether O
the NOM_PER
child NOM_PER
would O
survive O
to O
bear O
any O
name O
at O
all O
; O
in O
which O
case O
it O
is O
somewhat O
more O
than O
probable O
that O
these O
memoirs O
would O
never O
have O
appeared O
; O
or O
, O
if O
they O
had O
, O
that O
being O
comprised O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
pages O
, O
they O
would O
have O
possessed O
the O
inestimable O
merit O
of O
being O
the O
most O
concise O
and O
faithful O
specimen O
of O
biography O
, O
extant O
in O
the O
literature O
of O
any O
age O
or O
country O
. O
Although O
I PRON_PER
am O
not O
disposed O
to O
maintain O
that O
the O
being O
born O
in O
a O
workhouse O
, O
is O
in O
itself O
the O
most O
fortunate O
and O
enviable O
circumstance O
that O
can O
possibly O
befall O
a NOM_PER
human NOM_PER
being NOM_PER
, O
I PRON_PER
do O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
in O
this O
particular O
instance O
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
thing O
for O
Oliver PROP_PER
Twist PROP_PER
that O
could O
by O
possibility O
have O
occurred O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
there O
was O
considerable O
difficulty O
in O
inducing O
Oliver PROP_PER
to O
take O
upon O
himself PRON_PER
the O
office O
of O
respiration O
, O
-- O
a O
troublesome O
practice O
, O
but O
one O
which O
custom O
has O
rendered O
necessary O
to O
our PRON_PER
easy O
existence O
; O
and O
for O
some O
time O
he PRON_PER
lay O
gasping O
on O
a O
little O
flock O
mattress O
, O
rather O
unequally O
poised O
between O
this O
world O
and O
the O
next O
: O
the O
balance O
being O
decidedly O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
latter O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
, O
during O
this O
brief O
period O
, O
Oliver PROP_PER
had O
been O
surrounded O
by O
careful NOM_PER
grandmothers NOM_PER
, O
anxious NOM_PER
aunts NOM_PER
, O
experienced NOM_PER
nurses NOM_PER
, O
and O
doctors NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
profound NOM_PER
wisdom NOM_PER
, O
he PRON_PER
would O
most O
inevitably O
and O
indubitably O
have O
been O
killed O
in O
no O
time O
. O
There O
being O
nobody NOM_PER
by O
, O
however O
, O
but O
a O
pauper NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
was NOM_PER
rendered NOM_PER
rather NOM_PER
misty NOM_PER
by NOM_PER
an NOM_PER
unwonted NOM_PER
allowance NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
beer NOM_PER
; O
and O
a NOM_PER
parish NOM_PER
surgeon NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
did NOM_PER
such NOM_PER
matters NOM_PER
by NOM_PER
contract NOM_PER
; O
Oliver PROP_PER
and O
Nature O
fought O
out O
the O
point O
between O
them O
. O
The O
result O
was O
, O
that O
, O
after O
a O
few O
struggles O
, O
Oliver PROP_PER
breathed O
, O
sneezed O
, O
and O
proceeded O
to O
advertise O
to O
the NOM_PER
inmates NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
workhouse NOM_PER
the O
fact O
of O
a O
new O
burden O
having O
been O
imposed O
upon O
the O
parish O
, O
by O
setting O
up O
as O
loud O
a O
cry O
as O
could O
reasonably O
have O
been O
expected O
from O
a NOM_PER
male NOM_PER
infant NOM_PER
who NOM_PER
had NOM_PER
not NOM_PER
been NOM_PER
possessed NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
that NOM_PER
very NOM_PER
useful NOM_PER
appendage NOM_PER
, O
a O
voice O
, O
for O
a O
much O
longer O
space O
of O
time O
than O
three O
minutes O
and O
a O
quarter O
. O
As O
Oliver PROP_PER
gave O
this O
first O
proof O
of O
the O
free O
and O
proper O
action O
of O
his PRON_PER
lungs O
, O
the O
patchwork O
coverlet O
which O
was O
carelessly O
flung O
over O
the O
iron O
bedstead O
, O
rustled O
; O
the O
pale O
face O
of O
a NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
was O
raised O
feebly O
from O
the O
pillow O
; O
and O
a O
faint O
voice O
imperfectly O
articulated O
the O
words O
, O
' O
Let O
me PRON_PER
see O
the NOM_PER
child NOM_PER
, O
and O
die O
. O
' O
The NOM_PER
surgeon NOM_PER
had O
been O
sitting O
with O
his PRON_PER
face O
turned O
towards O
the O
fire O
: O
giving O
the O
palms O
of O
his PRON_PER
hands O
a O
warm O
and O
a O
rub O
alternately O
. O
As O
the NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
woman NOM_PER
spoke O
, O
he PRON_PER
rose O
, O
and O
advancing O
to O
the O
bed O
's O
head O
, O
said O
, O
with O
more O
kindness O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
of O
him PRON_PER
: O
' O
Oh O
, O
you PRON_PER
must O
not O
talk O
about O
dying O
yet O
. O
' O
' O
Lor O
bless O
her PRON_PER
dear O
heart O
, O
no O
! O
' O
interposed O
the NOM_PER
nurse NOM_PER
, O
hastily O
depositing O
in O
her PRON_PER
pocket O
a O
green O
glass O
bottle O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
which O
she PRON_PER
had O
been O
tasting O
in O
a O
corner O
with O
evident O
satisfaction O
. O
' O
Lor O
bless O
her PRON_PER
dear O
heart O
, O
when O
she PRON_PER
has O
lived O
as O
long O
as O
I PRON_PER
have O
, O
sir NOM_PER
, O
and O
had O
thirteen NOM_PER
children NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
her NOM_PER
own NOM_PER
, O
and O
all O
on O
'em O
dead O
except O
two O
, O
and O
them O
in O
the O
wurkus O
with O
me O
, O
she O
'll O
know O
better O
than O
to O
take O
on O
in O
that O
way O
, O
bless O
her O
dear O
heart O
! O
Think O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
a O
mother O
, O
there O
's O
a O
dear O
young O
lamb O
do O
. O
' O
Apparently O
this O
consolatory O
perspective O
of O
a O
mother O
's O
prospects O
failed O
in O
producing O
its O
due O
effect O
. O
The O
patient O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
and O
stretched O
out O
her O
hand O
towards O
the O
child O
. O
The O
surgeon O
deposited O
it O
in O
her O
arms O
. O
She O
imprinted O
her O
cold O
white O
lips O
passionately O
on O
its O
forehead O
; O
passed O
her O
hands O
over O
her O
face O
; O
gazed O
wildly O
round O
; O
shuddered O
; O
fell O
back O
-- O
and O
died O
. O
They O
chafed O
her O
breast O
, O
hands O
, O
and O
temples O
; O
but O
the O
blood O
had O
stopped O
forever O
. O
They O
talked O
of O
hope O
and O
comfort O
. O
They O
had O
been O
strangers O
too O
long O
. O
' O
It O
's O
all O
over O

Mrs. O
Thingummy O
! O
' O
said O
the O
surgeon O
at O
last O
. O
' O
Ah O
, O
poor O
dear O
, O
so O
it O
is O
! O
' O
said O
the O
nurse O
, O
picking O
up O
the O
cork O
of O
the O
green O
bottle O
, O
which O
had O
fallen O
out O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
as O
she O
stooped O
to O
take O
up O
the O
child O
. O
' O
Poor O
dear O
! O
' O
' O
You O

mind O
sending O
up O
to O
me O
, O

the O
child O
cries O

' O
said O
the O
surgeon O
, O
putting O
on O
his O
gloves O
with O
great O
deliberation O
. O
' O
It O
's O
very O
likely O
it O

will O
_ O
be O
troublesome O
. O
Give O
it O
a O
little O
gruel O
if O
it O
is O

' O
He O
put O
on O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
, O
pausing O
by O
the O
bed-side O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
door O
, O
added O
, O
' O
She O
was O
a O
good-looking O
girl O

from O

the O
old O
woman O

by O
the O
overseer O

nobody O

The O
surgeon O
leaned O
over O
the O
body O

raised O
the O
left O
hand O

old O
story O

his O

Good-night O

The O
medical O
gentleman O
walked O
away O
to O
dinner O
; O
and O
the O
nurse O
, O
having O
once O
more O
applied O
herself O
to O
the O
green O
bottle O
, O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
low O
chair O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
proceeded O
to O
dress O

infant O
. O
What O
an O
excellent O
example O
of O
the O
power O
of O
dress O
, O
young O
Oliver O
Twist O
was O
! O
Wrapped O
in O
the O
blanket O
which O
had O
hitherto O
formed O
his O
only O
covering O
, O
he O
might O
have O
been O
the O
child O
of O
a O
nobleman O
or O
a O
beggar O
; O
it O
would O
have O
been O
hard O
for O
the O
haughtiest O
stranger O
to O
have O
assigned O
him O
his O
proper O
station O
in O
society O
. O
But O
now O
that O
he O
was O
enveloped O
in O
the O
old O
calico O
robes O
which O
had O
grown O
yellow O
in O
the O
same O
service O
, O
he O
was O
badged O
and O
ticketed O
, O
and O
fell O
into O
his O
place O
at O
once O
-- O
a O
parish O
child O
-- O
the O
orphan O
of O
a O
workhouse O
-- O
the O
humble O
, O
half-starved O
drudge O

to O
be O
cuffed O

buffeted O

despised O

lustily O

If O
he O
could O
have O
known O

left O

CHAPTER O

TREATS O
OF O
OLIVER O
TWIST O
'S O
GROWTH O
, O
EDUCATION O
, O
AND O
BOARD O
For O
the O
next O
eight O
or O
ten O
months O
, O
Oliver O
was O
the O
victim O
of O
a O
systematic O
course O
of O
treachery O
and O
deception O
. O
He O
was O
brought O
up O
by O
hand O
. O
The O
hungry O
and O
destitute O
situation O
of O
the O
infant O
orphan O
was O
duly O
reported O
by O
the O
workhouse O
authorities O
to O
the O
parish O
authorities O
. O
The O
parish O
authorities O
inquired O
with O
dignity O
of O
the O
workhouse O
authorities O
, O
whether O
there O
was O
no O
female O
then O
domiciled O
in O
' O
the O
house O
' O
who O
was O
in O
a O
situation O
to O
impart O
to O
Oliver O
Twist O
, O
the O
consolation O
and O
nourishment O
of O
which O
he O
stood O
in O
need O
. O
The O
workhouse O
authorities O
replied O
with O
humility O
, O
that O
there O
was O
not O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
the O
parish O
authorities O
magnanimously O
and O
humanely O
resolved O
, O
that O
Oliver O
should O
be O
' O
farmed O
, O
' O
or O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
that O
he O
should O
be O
dispatched O
to O
a O
branch-workhouse O
some O
three O
miles O
off O
, O
where O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
other O
juvenile O
offenders O
against O
the O
poor-laws O
, O
rolled O
about O
the O
floor O
all O
day O
, O
without O
the O
inconvenience O
of O
too O
much O
food O
or O
too O
much O
clothing O
, O
under O
the O
parental O
superintendence O
of O
an O
elderly O
female O
, O
who O
received O
the O
culprits O
at O
and O
for O
the O
consideration O
of O
sevenpence-halfpenny O
per O
small O
head O
per O
week O
. O
Sevenpence-halfpenny O
's O
worth O
per O
week O
is O
a O
good O
round O
diet O
for O
a O
child O
; O
a O
great O
deal O
may O
be O
got O
for O
sevenpence-halfpenny O
, O
quite O
enough O
to O
overload O
its O
stomach O
, O
and O
make O
it O
uncomfortable O
. O
The O
elderly O
female O
was O
a O
woman O
of O
wisdom O
and O
experience O
; O
she O
knew O
what O
was O
good O
for O
children O
; O
and O
she O
had O
a O
very O
accurate O
perception O
of O
what O
was O
good O
for O
herself O
. O
So O
, O
she O
appropriated O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
weekly O
stipend O
to O
her O
own O
use O
, O
and O
consigned O
the O
rising O
parochial O
generation O
to O
even O
a O
shorter O
allowance O
than O
was O
originally O
provided O
for O
them O
. O
Thereby O
finding O
in O
the O
lowest O
depth O
a O
deeper O
still O
; O
and O
proving O
herself O
a O
very O
great O
experimental O
philosopher O
. O
Everybody O
knows O
the O
story O
of O
another O
experimental O
philosopher O
who O
had O
a O
great O
theory O
about O
a O
horse O
being O
able O
to O
live O
without O
eating O
, O
and O
who O
demonstrated O
it O
so O
well O
, O
that O
he O
had O
got O
his O
own O
horse O
down O
to O
a O
straw O
a O
day O
, O
and O
would O
unquestionably O
have O
rendered O
him O
a O
very O
spirited O
and O
rampacious O
animal O
on O
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
died O
, O
four-and-twenty O
hours O
before O
he O
was O
to O
have O
had O
his O
first O
comfortable O
bait O
of O
air O
. O
Unfortunately O
for O
, O
the O
experimental O
philosophy O
of O
the O
female O
to O
whose O
protecting O
care O
Oliver O
Twist O
was O
delivered O
over O
, O
a O
similar O
result O
usually O
attended O
the O
operation O
of O
_ O
her O
_ O
system O
; O
for O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
the O
child O
had O
contrived O
to O
exist O
upon O
the O
smallest O
possible O
portion O
of O
the O
weakest O
possible O
food O
, O
it O
did O
perversely O
happen O
in O
eight O
and O
a O
half O
cases O
out O
of O
ten O
, O
either O
that O
it O
sickened O
from O
want O
and O
cold O
, O
or O
fell O
into O
the O
fire O
from O
neglect O
, O
or O
got O
half-smothered O
by O
accident O
; O
in O
any O
one O
of O
which O
cases O
, O
the O
miserable O
little O
being O
was O
usually O
summoned O
into O
another O
world O
, O
and O
there O
gathered O
to O
the O
fathers O
it O
had O
never O
known O
in O
this O
. O
Occasionally O
, O
when O
there O
was O
some O
more O
than O
usually O
interesting O
inquest O
upon O
a O
parish O
child O
who O
had O
been O
overlooked O
in O
turning O
up O
a O
bedstead O
, O
or O
inadvertently O
scalded O
to O
death O
when O
there O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
washing O
-- O
though O
the O
latter O
accident O
was O
very O
scarce O
, O
anything O
approaching O
to O
a O
washing O
being O
of O
rare O
occurrence O
in O
the O
farm O
-- O
the O
jury O
would O
take O
it O
into O
their O
heads O
to O
ask O
troublesome O
questions O
, O
or O
the O
parishioners O
would O
rebelliously O
affix O
their O
signatures O
to O
a O
remonstrance O
. O
But O
these O
impertinences O
were O
speedily O
checked O
by O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
surgeon O
, O
and O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
beadle O
; O
the O
former O
of O
whom O
had O
always O
opened O
the O
body O
and O
found O
nothing O
inside O
( O
which O
was O
very O
probable O
indeed O
) O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
of O
whom O
invariably O
swore O
whatever O
the O
parish O
wanted O
; O
which O
was O
very O
self-devotional O
. O
Besides O
, O
the O
board O
made O
periodical O
pilgrimages O
to O
the O
farm O
, O
and O
always O
sent O
the O
beadle O
the O
day O
before O
, O
to O
say O
they O
were O
going O
. O
The O
children O
were O
neat O
and O
clean O
to O
behold O
, O
when O
_ O
they O
_ O
went O
; O
and O
what O
more O
would O
the O
people O
have O
! O

Chapter O

The O
cold O
passed O
reluctantly O
from O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
the O
retiring O
fogs O
revealed O
an O
army O
stretched O
out O
on O
the O
hills O
, O
resting O
. O
As O
the O
landscape O
changed O
from O
brown O
to O
green O
, O
the O
army O
awakened O
, O
and O
began O
to O
tremble O
with O
eagerness O
at O
the O
noise O
of O
rumors O
. O
It O
cast O
its O
eyes O
upon O
the O
roads O
, O
which O
were O
growing O
from O
long O
troughs O
of O
liquid O
mud O
to O
proper O
thoroughfares O
. O
A O
river O
, O
amber-tinted O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
its O
banks O
, O
purled O
at O
the O
army O
's O
feet O
; O
and O
at O
night O
, O
when O
the O
stream O
had O
become O
of O
a O
sorrowful O
blackness O
, O
one O
could O
see O
across O
it O
the O
red O
, O
eyelike O
gleam O
of O
hostile O
camp-fires O
set O
in O
the O
low O
brows O

distant O
hills O

Once O
a NOM_PER
certain NOM_PER
tall NOM_PER
soldier NOM_PER
developed O
virtues O
and O
went O
resolutely O
to O
wash O
a O
shirt O
. O
He PRON_PER
came O
flying O
back O
from O
a O
brook O
waving O
his PRON_PER
garment O
bannerlike O
. O
He PRON_PER
was O
swelled O
with O
a O
tale O
he PRON_PER
had O
heard O
from O
a NOM_PER
reliable NOM_PER
friend NOM_PER
, O
who O
had O
heard O
it O
from O
a NOM_PER
truthful NOM_PER
cavalryman NOM_PER
, O
who O
had O
heard O
it O
from O
his NOM_PER
trustworthy NOM_PER
brother NOM_PER
, NOM_PER
one NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
the NOM_PER
orderlies NOM_PER
at NOM_PER
division NOM_PER
headquarters NOM_PER
. O
He O
adopted O
the O
important O
air O
of O
a O
herald O
in O
red O
and O
gold O
. O
" O
We O
're O
goin O
' O
t O
' O
move O
t O
' O
morrah O
-- O
sure O
, O
" O
he O
said O
pompously O
to O
a O
group O
in O
the O
company O
street O
. O
" O
We O
're O
goin O
' O
' O
way O
up O
the O
river O
, O
cut O
across O
, O
an O
' O
come O
around O
in O
behint O
'em O
. O
" O
To O
his O
attentive O
audience O
he O
drew O
a O
loud O
and O
elaborate O
plan O
of O
a O
very O
brilliant O
campaign O
. O
When O
he O
had O
finished O
, O
the O
blue-clothed O
men O
scattered O
into O
small O
arguing O
groups O
between O
the O
rows O
of O
squat O
brown O
huts O
. O
A O
negro O
teamster O
who O
had O
been O
dancing O
upon O
a O
cracker O
box O
with O
the O
hilarious O
encouragement O
of O
twoscore O
soldiers O
was O
deserted O
. O
He O
sat O
mournfully O
down O
. O
Smoke O
drifted O
lazily O
from O
a O
multitude O
of O
quaint O
chimneys O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a O
lie O
! O
that O
's O
all O
it O
is O
-- O
a O
thunderin O
' O
lie O
! O
" O
said O
another O
private O
loudly O
. O
His O
smooth O
face O
was O
flushed O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
were O
thrust O
sulkily O
into O
his O
trouser O
's O
pockets O
. O
He O
took O
the O
matter O
as O
an O
affront O
to O
him O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
the O
derned O
old O
army O

ever O
going O
to O
move O
. O
We O
're O
set O

I O
've O
got O
ready O
to O
move O
eight O
times O
in O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
, O
and O
we O
ai O
n't O
moved O
yet O
. O
" O
The O
tall O
soldier O
felt O
called O
upon O
to O
defend O
the O
truth O
of O
a O
rumor O
he O
himself O
had O
introduced O
. O
He O
and O
the O
loud O
one O
came O
near O
to O
fighting O
over O
it O
. O
A O
corporal O
began O
to O
swear O
before O
the O
assemblage O
. O
He O
had O
just O
put O
a O
costly O
board O
floor O
in O
his O
house O
, O
he O
said O
. O
During O
the O
early O
spring O
he O
had O
refrained O
from O
adding O
extensively O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
his O
environment O
because O
he O
had O
felt O
that O
the O
army O
might O
start O
on O
the O
march O
at O
any O
moment O
. O
Of O
late O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
been O
impressed O
that O
they O
were O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
eternal O
camp O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
men O
engaged O
in O
a O
spirited O
debate O
. O
One O
outlined O
in O
a O
peculiarly O
lucid O
manner O
all O
the O
plans O
of O
the O
commanding O
general O
. O
He O
was O
opposed O
by O
men O
who O
advocated O
that O
there O
were O
other O
plans O
of O
campaign O
. O
They O
clamored O
at O
each O
other O
, O
numbers O
making O
futile O
bids O
for O
the O
popular O
attention O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
soldier O
who O
had O
fetched O
the O
rumor O
bustled O
about O
with O
much O
importance O
. O
He O
was O
continually O
assailed O
by O
questions O
. O
" O
What O
's O
up O
, O
Jim O
? O
" O
" O
Th O

. O
" O
There O
was O
much O
food O
for O
thought O
in O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
replied O
. O
He O
came O
near O
to O
convincing O
them O
by O
disdaining O
to O
produce O
proofs O
. O
They O
grew O
much O
excited O
over O
it O
. O
There O
was O
a O
youthful O
private O
who O
listened O
with O
eager O
ears O
to O
the O
words O
of O
the O
tall O
soldier O
and O
to O
the O
varied O
comments O
of O
his O
comrades O
. O
After O
receiving O
a O
fill O
of O
discussions O
concerning O
marches O
and O
attacks O
, O
he O
went O
to O
his O
hut O
and O
crawled O
through O
an O
intricate O
hole O
that O
served O
it O
as O
a O
door O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
some O
new O
thoughts O
that O
had O
lately O
come O
to O
him O
. O
He O
lay O
down O
on O
a O
wide O
bunk O
that O
stretched O
across O
the O
end O
of O
the O
room O
. O
In O
the O
other O
end O
, O
cracker O
boxes O
were O
made O
to O
serve O
as O
furniture O
. O
They O
were O
grouped O
about O
the O
fireplace O
. O
A O
picture O
from O
an O
illustrated O
weekly O
was O
upon O
the O
log O
walls O
, O
and O
three O
rifles O
were O
paralleled O
on O
pegs O
. O
Equipments O
hung O
on O
handy O
projections O
, O
and O
some O
tin O
dishes O
lay O
upon O
a O
small O
pile O
of O
firewood O
. O
A O
folded O
tent O
was O
serving O
as O
a O
roof O
. O
The O
sunlight O
, O
without O
, O
beating O
upon O
it O
, O
made O
it O
glow O
a O
light O
yellow O
shade O
. O
A O
small O
window O
shot O
an O
oblique O
square O
of O
whiter O
light O
upon O
the O
cluttered O
floor O
. O
The O
smoke O
from O
the O
fire O
at O
times O
neglected O
the O
clay O
chimney O
and O
wreathed O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
this O
flimsy O
chimney O
of O
clay O
and O
sticks O
made O
endless O
threats O
to O
set O
ablaze O
the O
whole O
establishment O
. O
The O
youth O
was O
in O
a O
little O
trance O
of O
astonishment O
. O
So O
they O
were O
at O
last O
going O
to O
fight O
. O
On O
the O
morrow O
, O
perhaps O
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
battle O
, O
and O
he O
would O
be O
in O
it O
. O
For O
a O
time O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
labor O
to O
make O
himself O
believe O
. O
He O
could O
not O
accept O
with O
assurance O
an O
omen O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
mingle O
in O
one O
of O
those O
great O
affairs O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
He O
had O
, O
of O
course O
, O
dreamed O
of O
battles O
all O
his O
life O
-- O
of O
vague O
and O
bloody O
conflicts O
that O
had O
thrilled O
him O
with O
their O
sweep O
and O
fire O
. O
In O
visions O
he O
had O
seen O
himself O
in O
many O
struggles O
. O
He O
had O
imagined O
peoples O
secure O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
his O
eagle-eyed O
prowess O
. O
But O
awake O
he O
had O
regarded O
battles O
as O
crimson O
blotches O
on O
the O
pages O
of O
the O
past O
. O
He O
had O
put O
them O
as O
things O
of O
the O
bygone O
with O
his O
thought-images O
of O
heavy O
crowns O
and O
high O
castles O
. O
There O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
world O
's O
history O
which O
he O
had O
regarded O
as O
the O
time O
of O
wars O
, O
but O
it O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
had O
been O
long O
gone O
over O
the O
horizon O
and O
had O
disappeared O
forever O
. O
From O
his O
home O
his O
youthful O
eyes O
had O
looked O
upon O
the O
war O
in O
his O
own O
country O
with O
distrust O
. O
It O
must O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
play O
affair O
. O
He O
had O
long O
despaired O
of O
witnessing O
a O
Greeklike O
struggle O
. O
Such O
would O
be O
no O
more O
, O
he O
had O
said O
. O
Men O
were O
better O
, O
or O
more O
timid O
. O
Secular O
and O
religious O
education O
had O
effaced O
the O
throat-grappling O
instinct O
, O
or O
else O
firm O
finance O
held O
in O
check O
the O
passions O
. O
He O
had O
burned O
several O
times O
to O
enlist O
. O
Tales O
of O
great O
movements O
shook O
the O
land O
. O
They O
might O
not O
be O
distinctly O
Homeric O
, O
but O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
much O
glory O
in O
them O
. O
He O
had O
read O
of O
marches O
, O
sieges O
, O
conflicts O
, O
and O
he O
had O
longed O
to O
see O
it O
all O
. O
His O
busy O
mind O
had O
drawn O
for O
him O
large O
pictures O
extravagant O
in O
color O
, O
lurid O
with O
breathless O
deeds O
. O
But O
his O
mother O
had O
discouraged O
him O
. O
She O
had O
affected O
to O
look O
with O
some O
contempt O
upon O
the O
quality O
of O
his O
war O
ardor O
and O
patriotism O
. O
She O
could O
calmly O
seat O
herself O
and O
with O
no O
apparent O
difficulty O
give O
him O
many O
hundreds O
of O
reasons O
why O
he O
was O
of O
vastly O
more O
importance O
on O
the O
farm O
than O
on O
the O
field O
of O
battle O
. O
She O
had O
had O
certain O
ways O
of O
expression O
that O
told O
him O
that O
her O
statements O
on O
the O
subject O
came O
from O
a O
deep O
conviction O
. O
Moreover O
, O
on O
her O
side O
, O
was O
his O
belief O
that O
her O
ethical O
motive O
in O
the O
argument O
was O
impregnable O
. O
At O
last O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
made O
firm O
rebellion O
against O
this O
yellow O
light O
thrown O
upon O
the O
color O
of O
his O
ambitions O
. O
The O
newspapers O
, O
the O
gossip O
of O
the O
village O
, O
his O
own O
picturings O
, O
had O
aroused O
him O
to O
an O
uncheckable O
degree O
. O
They O
were O
in O
truth O
fighting O
finely O
down O
there O
. O
Almost O
every O
day O
the O
newspaper O
printed O
accounts O
of O
a O
decisive O
victory O
. O
One O
night O
, O
as O
he O
lay O
in O
bed O
, O
the O
winds O
had O
carried O
to O
him O
the O
clangoring O
of O
the O
church O
bell O
as O
some O
enthusiast O
jerked O
the O
rope O
frantically O
to O
tell O
the O
twisted O
news O
of O
a O
great O
battle O
. O
This O
voice O
of O
the O
people O
rejoicing O
in O
the O
night O
had O
made O
him O
shiver O
in O
a O
prolonged O
ecstasy O
of O
excitement O
. O
Later O
, O
he O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
his O
mother O
's O
room O
and O
had O
spoken O
thus O
: O
" O
Ma O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
enlist O
. O
" O
" O
Henry O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
be O
a O
fool O
, O
" O
his O
mother O
had O
replied O
. O
She O
had O
then O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
the O
quilt O
. O
There O
was O
an O
end O
to O
the O
matter O
for O
that O
night O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
next O
morning O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
a O
town O
that O
was O
near O
his O
mother O
's O
farm O
and O
had O
enlisted O
in O
a O
company O
that O
was O
forming O
there O
. O
When O
he O
had O
returned O
home O
his O
mother O
was O
milking O
the O
brindle O
cow O
. O
Four O
others O
stood O
waiting O
. O
" O
Ma O
, O
I O
've O
enlisted O
, O
" O
he O
had O
said O
to O
her O
diffidently O
. O
There O
was O
a O
short O
silence O
. O
" O
The O
Lord O
's O
will O
be O
done O
, O
Henry O
, O
" O
she O
had O
finally O
replied O
, O
and O
had O
then O
continued O
to O
milk O
the O
brindle O
cow O
. O
When O
he O
had O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway O
with O
his O
soldier O
's O
clothes O
on O
his O
back O
, O
and O
with O
the O
light O
of O
excitement O
and O
expectancy O
in O
his O
eyes O
almost O
defeating O
the O
glow O
of O
regret O
for O
the O
home O
bonds O
, O
he O
had O
seen O
two O
tears O
leaving O
their O
trails O
on O
his O
mother O
's O
scarred O
cheeks O
. O
Still O
, O
she O
had O
disappointed O
him O
by O
saying O
nothing O
whatever O
about O
returning O
with O
his O
shield O
or O
on O
it O
. O
He O
had O
privately O
primed O
himself O
for O
a O
beautiful O
scene O
. O
He O
had O
prepared O
certain O
sentences O
which O
he O
thought O
could O
be O
used O
with O
touching O
effect O
. O
But O
her O
words O
destroyed O
his O
plans O
. O
She O
had O
doggedly O
peeled O
potatoes O
and O
addressed O
him O
as O
follows O
: O
" O

No O

The NOM_PER
old NOM_PER
lady NOM_PER
pulled O
her PRON_PER
spectacles O
down O
and O
looked O
over O
them O
about O
the O
room O
; O
then O
she PRON_PER
put O
them O
up O
and O
looked O
out O
under O
them O
. O
She PRON_PER
seldom O
or O
never O
looked O
_ O
through O
_ O
them PRON_PER
for O
so O
small O
a O
thing O
as O
a NOM_PER
boy NOM_PER
; O
they O
were O
her PRON_PER
state O

the O
pride O
of O
her NOM_PER
heart NOM_PER
, O
and O
were O
built O
for O
" O
style O

" O
not O
service O
-- O
she O
could O
have O
seen O
through O
a O
pair O
of O
stove-lids O
just O
as O
well O
. O
She O
looked O
perplexed O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
not O
fiercely O
, O
but O
still O
loud O
enough O
for O
the O
furniture O
to O
hear O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
lay O
if O
I O
get O
hold O
of O
you O

" O
She O
did O
not O
finish O

for O
by O
this O
time O
she O
was O
bending O
down O
and O
punching O
under O
the O
bed O
with O
the O
broom O
, O
and O
so O
she O
needed O
breath O
to O
punctuate O
the O
punches O
with O
. O
She O
resurrected O
nothing O
but O
the O
cat O
. O
" O
I O
never O
did O
see O
the O
beat O
of O
that O
boy O
! O
" O
She O
went O
to O
the O
open O
door O
and O
stood O
in O
it O
and O
looked O
out O
among O
the O
tomato O
vines O
and O
" O
jimpson O
" O
weeds O
that O
constituted O
the O
garden O
. O
No O
Tom O
. O
So O
she O
lifted O
up O
her O
voice O
at O
an O
angle O
calculated O
for O
distance O
and O
shouted O
: O
" O
Y-o-u-u O
TOM O
! O
" O
There O
was O
a O
slight O
noise O
behind O
her O
and O
she O
turned O
just O
in O
time O
to O
seize O
a O
small O
boy O
by O
the O
slack O
of O
his O
roundabout O
and O
arrest O
his O
flight O
. O
" O
There O
! O
I O
might O

The O

hovered O
in O

the O
peril O
was O
desperate O

" O
My O

Look O

The O
old O
lady O
whirled O
round O

snatched O
her O
skirts O
out O
of O
danger O

The O
lad O
fled O
on O
the O
instant O
, O
scrambled O
up O
the O
high O
board-fence O
, O
and O
disappeared O
over O
it O
. O
His O
aunt O
Polly O
stood O
surprised O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
broke O
into O
a O
gentle O
laugh O

" O
Hang O
the O
boy O

ca O

I O
never O

Ai O

out O

put O
me O
off O
for O
a O
minute O

make O
me O
laugh O

all O
down O

wood O

split O
the O
kindlings O
before O
supper O

at O

he O
was O
there O
in O
time O
to O
tell O
his O
adventures O
to O
Jim O

Jim O
did O
three-fourths O
of O
the O
work O

Tom O

younger O
brother O
( O

half-brother O

Sid O
was O
already O
through O
with O
his O
part O
of O
the O
work O

picking O
up O

, O
for O
he O
was O
a O
quiet O
boy O

had O
no O
adventurous O

trouble-some O
ways O

While O
Tom O
was O
eating O
his O
supper O

and O
stealing O
sugar O
as O
opportunity O
offered O

Aunt O
Polly O
asked O
him O
questions O
that O
were O
full O
of O
guile O
, O
and O
very O
deep O
-- O
for O
she O
wanted O
to O
trap O
him O
into O
damaging O
revealments O
. O
Like O
many O
other O
simple-hearted O
souls O
, O
it O
was O
her O
pet O
vanity O
to O
believe O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
a O
talent O
for O
dark O
and O
mysterious O
diplomacy O
, O
and O
she O
loved O
to O
contemplate O
her O
most O
transparent O
devices O
as O
marvels O
of O
low O
cunning O
. O
Said O
she O
: O

" O
" O
Did O
n't O
you O
want O
to O
go O
in O
a-swimming O
, O
Tom O
? O
" O
A O
bit O
of O
a O
scare O
shot O
through O
Tom O
-- O
a O
touch O
of O
uncomfortable O
suspicion O
. O
He O
searched O
Aunt O
Polly O
's O
face O
, O
but O
it O
told O
him O
nothing O
. O
So O
he O
said O
: O
" O
No O
'm O
-- O
well O
, O
not O
very O
much O
. O
" O
The O
old O
lady O
reached O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
felt O
Tom O
's O
shirt O
, O
and O
said O
: O
" O
But O
you O
ai O
n't O
too O
warm O
now O
, O
though O
. O
" O
And O
it O
flattered O
her O
to O
reflect O
that O
she O
had O
discovered O
that O
the O
shirt O
was O
dry O
without O
anybody O
knowing O
that O
that O
was O
what O
she O
had O
in O
her O
mind O
. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
, O
Tom O
knew O
where O
the O
wind O
lay O
, O
now O
. O
So O
he O
forestalled O
what O
might O
be O
the O
next O
move O
: O
" O
Some O
of O
us O
pumped O
on O
our O
heads O
-- O
mine O
's O
damp O
yet O
. O
See O
? O
" O
Aunt O
Polly O
was O
vexed O
to O
think O
she O
had O
overlooked O
that O
bit O
of O
circumstantial O
evidence O
, O
and O
missed O
a O
trick O
. O
Then O
she O
had O
a O
new O
inspiration O
: O
" O
Tom O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
undo O
your O
shirt O
collar O
where O
I O
sewed O
it O
, O
to O
pump O
on O
your O
head O
, O
did O
you O
? O
Unbutton O
your O
jacket O
! O
" O
The O
trouble O
vanished O
out O
of O
Tom O
's O
face O
. O
He O
opened O
his O
jacket O
. O
His O
shirt O
collar O
was O
securely O
sewed O
. O
" O
Bother O
! O
Well O
, O
go O
' O
long O
with O
you O
. O
I O
'd O
made O
sure O
you O
'd O
played O
hookey O
and O
been O
a-swimming O
. O
But O
I O
forgive O
ye O
, O
Tom O
. O
I O
reckon O
you O
're O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
singed O
cat O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
-- O
better O
'n O
you O
look O
. O
_ O
This O
_ O
time O
. O
" O
She O
was O
half O
sorry O
her O
sagacity O
had O
miscarried O
, O
and O
half O
glad O
that O
Tom O
had O
stumbled O
into O
obedient O
conduct O
for O
once O
. O
But O
Sidney O
said O
: O
" O
Well O
, O
now O
, O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
you O
sewed O
his O
collar O
with O
white O
thread O
, O
but O
it O
's O
black O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
did O
sew O
it O
with O
white O
! O
Tom O
! O
" O
But O
Tom O
did O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
rest O
. O
As O
he O
went O
out O
at O
the O
door O
he O
said O
: O
" O
Siddy O
, O
I O
'll O
lick O
you O
for O
that O
. O
" O
In O
a O
safe O
place O
Tom O
examined O
two O
large O
needles O
which O
were O
thrust O
into O
the O
lapels O
of O
his O
jacket O
, O
and O
had O
thread O
bound O
about O
them O
-- O
one O
needle O
carried O
white O
thread O
and O
the O
other O
black O
. O
He O
said O
: O
" O
She O
'd O
never O
noticed O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
been O
for O
Sid O
. O
Confound O
it O
! O
sometimes O
she O
sews O
it O
with O
white O
, O
and O
sometimes O
she O
sews O
it O
with O
black O
. O
I O
wish O
to O
gee-miny O
she O
'd O
stick O
to O
one O
or O
t O
' O
other O
-- O
I O
ca O
n't O
keep O
the O
run O
of O
'em O
. O
But O
I O
bet O
you O
I O
'll O
lam O
Sid O
for O
that O
. O
I O
'll O
learn O
him O
! O
" O
He O
was O
not O
the O
Model O
Boy O
of O
the O
village O
. O
He O
knew O
the O
model O
boy O
very O
well O
though O
-- O
and O
loathed O
him O
. O
Within O
two O
minutes O
, O
or O
even O
less O
, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
all O
his O
troubles O
. O
Not O
because O
his O
troubles O
were O
one O
whit O
less O
heavy O
and O
bitter O
to O
him O
than O
a O
man O
's O
are O
to O
a O
man O
, O
but O
because O
a O
new O
and O
powerful O
interest O
bore O
them O
down O
and O
drove O
them O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
for O
the O
time O
-- O
just O
as O
men O
's O
misfortunes O
are O
forgotten O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
new O
enterprises O
. O
This O
new O
interest O
was O
a O
valued O
novelty O
in O
whistling O
, O
which O
he O
had O
just O
acquired O
from O
a O
negro O
, O
and O
he O
was O
suffering O
to O
practise O
it O
un-disturbed O
. O
It O
consisted O
in O
a O
peculiar O
bird-like O
turn O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
liquid O
warble O
, O
produced O
by O
touching O
the O
tongue O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
mouth O
at O
short O
intervals O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
music O
-- O
the O
reader O
probably O
remembers O
how O
to O
do O
it O
, O
if O
he O
has O
ever O
been O
a O
boy O
. O
Diligence O
and O
attention O
soon O
gave O
him O
the O
knack O
of O
it O
, O
and O
he O
strode O
down O
the O
street O
with O
his O
mouth O
full O
of O
harmony O
and O
his O
soul O
full O
of O
gratitude O
. O
He O
felt O
much O
as O
an O
astronomer O
feels O
who O
has O
discovered O
a O
new O
planet O
-- O
no O
doubt O
, O
as O
far O
as O
strong O
, O
deep O
, O
unalloyed O
pleasure O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
advantage O
was O
with O
the O
boy O
, O
not O
the O
astronomer O
. O
The O
summer O
evenings O
were O
long O
. O
It O
was O
not O
dark O
, O
yet O
. O
Presently O
Tom O
checked O
his O
whistle O
. O
A O
stranger O
was O
before O
him O
-- O
a O
boy O
a O
shade O
larger O
than O
himself O
. O
A O
new-comer O
of O
any O
age O
or O
either O
sex O
was O
an O
im-pressive O
curiosity O
in O
the O
poor O
little O
shabby O
village O
of O
St. O
Petersburg O
. O
This O
boy O
was O
well O
dressed O
, O
too O
-- O
well O
dressed O
on O
a O
week-day O
. O
This O
was O
simply O
as O
astounding O
. O
His O
cap O
was O
a O
dainty O
thing O
, O
his O
close-buttoned O
blue O
cloth O
roundabout O
was O
new O
and O
natty O
, O
and O
so O
were O
his O
pantaloons O
. O
He O
had O
shoes O
on O
-- O
and O
it O
was O
only O
Friday O
. O
He O
even O
wore O
a O
necktie O
, O
a O
bright O
bit O
of O
ribbon O
. O
He O
had O
a O
citified O
air O
about O
him O
that O
ate O
into O
Tom O
's O
vitals O
. O
The O
more O
Tom O
stared O
at O
the O
splendid O
marvel O
, O
the O
higher O
he O
turned O
up O
his O
nose O
at O
his O
finery O
and O
the O
shabbier O
and O
shabbier O
his O
own O
outfit O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
grow O
. O
Neither O
boy O
spoke O
. O
If O
one O
moved O
, O
the O
other O
moved O
-- O
but O
only O
sidewise O
, O
in O
a O
circle O
; O
they O
kept O
face O
to O
face O
and O
eye O
to O
eye O
all O
the O
time O
. O
Finally O
Tom O
said O
: O
" O
I O
can O
lick O
you O
! O
" O
" O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
you O
try O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
can O
do O
it O
. O

I PRON_PER
AM O
BORN O
Whether O
I PRON_PER
shall O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
the NOM_PER
hero NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
my NOM_PER

life NOM_PER
, O
or O
whether O
that O
station O
will O
be O
held O
by O
anybody O

, O
these O
pages O
must O
show O
. O
To O
begin O
my O
life O
with O
the O
beginning O
of O
my O
life O
, O
I O
record O
that O
I O
was O
born O
( O
as O
I O
have O
been O
informed O
and O
believe O
) O
on O
a O
Friday O
, O
at O
twelve O
o’clock O
at O
night O
. O
It O
was O
remarked O
that O
the O
clock O
began O
to O
strike O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
cry O
, O
simultaneously O
. O
In O
consideration O
of O
the O
day O
and O
hour O
of O
my O
birth O
, O
it O
was O
declared O
by O
the O
nurse O
, O
and O
by O
some O
sage O
women O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
who O
had O
taken O
a O
lively O
interest O
in O
me O
several O
months O
before O
there O
was O
any O
possibility O
of O
our O
becoming O
personally O
acquainted O
, O
first O
, O
that O
I O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
unlucky O
in O
life O
; O
and O
secondly O
, O
that O
I O
was O
privileged O
to O
see O
ghosts O
and O
spirits O
; O
both O
these O
gifts O
inevitably O
attaching O
, O
as O
they O
believed O
, O
to O
all O
unlucky O
infants O
of O
either O
gender O
, O
born O
towards O
the O
small O
hours O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
. O
I O
need O
say O
nothing O
here O
, O
on O
the O
first O
head O
, O
because O
nothing O
can O
show O
better O
than O
my O
history O
whether O
that O
prediction O
was O
verified O
or O
falsified O
by O
the O
result O
. O
On O
the O
second O
branch O
of O
the O
question O
, O
I O
will O
only O
remark O
, O
that O
unless O
I O
ran O
through O
that O
part O
of O
my O
inheritance O
while O
I O
was O
still O
a O
baby O
, O
I O
have O
not O
come O
into O
it O
yet O
. O
But O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
complain O
of O
having O
been O
kept O
out O
of O
this O
property O
; O
and O
if O
anybody O
else O
should O
be O
in O
the O
present O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
, O
he O
is O
heartily O
welcome O
to O
keep O
it O
. O
I O
was O
born O
with O
a O
caul O
, O
which O
was O
advertised O
for O
sale O
, O
in O
the O
newspapers O
, O
at O
the O
low O
price O
of O
fifteen O
guineas O
. O
Whether O
sea-going O
people O
were O
short O
of O
money O
about O
that O
time O
, O
or O
were O
short O
of O
faith O
and O
preferred O
cork O
jackets O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
; O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
there O
was O
but O
one O
solitary O
bidding O
, O
and O
that O
was O
from O
an O
attorney O
connected O
with O
the O
bill-broking O
business O
, O
who O
offered O
two O
pounds O
in O
cash O
, O
and O
the O
balance O
in O
sherry O
, O
but O
declined O
to O
be O
guaranteed O
from O
drowning O
on O
any O
higher O
bargain O
. O
Consequently O
the O
advertisement O
was O
withdrawn O
at O
a O
dead O
loss O
-- O
for O
as O
to O
sherry O
, O
my O
poor O
dear O
mother O
’s O
own O
sherry O
was O
in O
the O
market O
then O
-- O
and O
ten O
years O
afterwards O
, O
the O
caul O
was O
put O
up O
in O
a O
raffle O
down O
in O
our O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
to O
fifty O
members O
at O
half-a-crown O
a O
head O
, O
the O
winner O
to O
spend O
five O
shillings O
. O
I O
was O
present O
myself O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
to O
have O
felt O
quite O
uncomfortable O
and O
confused O
, O
at O
a O
part O
of O
myself O
being O
disposed O
of O
in O
that O
way O
. O
The O
caul O
was O
won O
, O
I O
recollect O
, O
by O
an O
old O
lady O
with O
a O
hand-basket O
, O
who O
, O
very O
reluctantly O
, O
produced O
from O
it O
the O
stipulated O
five O
shillings O
, O
all O
in O
halfpence O
, O
and O
twopence O
halfpenny O
short O
-- O
as O
it O
took O
an O
immense O
time O
and O
a O
great O
waste O
of O
arithmetic O
, O
to O
endeavour O
without O
any O
effect O
to O
prove O
to O
her O
. O
It O
is O
a O
fact O
which O
will O
be O
long O
remembered O
as O
remarkable O
down O
there O
, O
that O
she O
was O
never O
drowned O
, O
but O
died O
triumphantly O
in O
bed O
, O
at O
ninety-two O
. O
I O
have O
understood O
that O
it O
was O
, O
to O
the O
last O
, O
her O
proudest O
boast O
, O
that O
she O
never O
had O
been O
on O
the O
water O
in O
her O
life O
, O
except O
upon O
a O
bridge O
; O
and O
that O
over O
her O
tea O
( O
to O
which O
she O
was O
extremely O
partial O
) O
she O
, O
to O
the O
last O
, O
expressed O
her O
indignation O
at O
the O
impiety O
of O
mariners O
and O
others O
, O
who O
had O
the O
presumption O
to O
go O
‘ O
meandering O
’ O
about O
the O
world O
. O
It O
was O
in O
vain O
to O
represent O
to O
her O
that O
some O
conveniences O
, O
tea O
perhaps O
included O
, O
resulted O
from O
this O
objectionable O
practice O
. O
She O
always O
returned O
, O
with O
greater O
emphasis O
and O
with O
an O
instinctive O
knowledge O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
her O
objection O
, O
‘ O
Let O
us O
have O
no O
meandering O
. O
’ O
Not O
to O
meander O
myself O
, O
at O
present O
, O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
my O
birth O
. O
I O
was O
born O
at O
Blunderstone O
, O
in O
Suffolk O
, O
or O
‘ O
there O
by O
’ O
, O
as O
they O
say O
in O
Scotland O
. O
I O
was O
a O
posthumous O
child O
. O
My O
father O
’s O
eyes O
had O
closed O
upon O
the O
light O
of O
this O
world O
six O
months O
, O
when O
mine O
opened O
on O
it O
. O
There O
is O
something O
strange O
to O
me O
, O
even O
now O
, O
in O
the O
reflection O
that O
he O
never O
saw O
me O
; O
and O
something O
stranger O
yet O
in O
the O
shadowy O
remembrance O
that O
I O
have O
of O
my O
first O
childish O
associations O
with O
his O
white O
grave-stone O
in O
the O
churchyard O
, O
and O
of O
the O
indefinable O
compassion O
I O
used O
to O
feel O
for O
it O
lying O
out O
alone O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
night O
, O
when O
our O
little O
parlour O
was O
warm O
and O
bright O
with O
fire O
and O
candle O
, O
and O
the O
doors O
of O
our O
house O
were O
-- O
almost O
cruelly O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
sometimes O
-- O
bolted O
and O
locked O
against O
it O
. O
An O
aunt O
of O
my O
father O
’s O
, O
and O
consequently O
a O
great-aunt O
of O
mine O
, O
of O
whom O
I O
shall O
have O
more O
to O
relate O
by O
and O
by O
, O
was O
the O
principal O
magnate O
of O
our O
family O
. O
Miss O
Trotwood O
, O
or O
Miss O
Betsey O
, O
as O
my O
poor O
mother O
always O
called O
her O
, O
when O
she O
sufficiently O
overcame O
her O
dread O
of O
this O
formidable O
personage O
to O
mention O
her O
at O
all O
( O
which O
was O
seldom O
) O
, O
had O
been O
married O
to O
a O
husband O
younger O
than O
herself O
, O
who O
was O
very O
handsome O
, O
except O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
homely O
adage O
, O
‘ O
handsome O
is O
, O
that O
handsome O
does O
’ O
-- O
for O
he O
was O
strongly O
suspected O
of O
having O
beaten O
Miss O
Betsey O
, O
and O
even O
of O
having O
once O
, O
on O
a O
disputed O
question O
of O
supplies O
, O
made O
some O
hasty O
but O
determined O
arrangements O
to O
throw O
her O
out O
of O
a O
two O
pair O
of O
stairs O
’ O
window O
. O
These O
evidences O
of O
an O
incompatibility O
of O
temper O
induced O
Miss O
Betsey O
to O
pay O
him O
off O
, O
and O
effect O
a O
separation O
by O
mutual O
consent O
. O
He O
went O
to O
India O
with O
his O
capital O
, O
and O
there O
, O
according O
to O
a O
wild O
legend O
in O
our O
family O
, O
he O
was O
once O
seen O
riding O
on O
an O
elephant O
, O
in O
company O
with O
a O
Baboon O
; O
but O
I O
think O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
Baboo O
-- O
or O
a O
Begum O
. O
Anyhow O
, O
from O
India O
tidings O
of O
his O
death O
reached O
home O
, O
within O
ten O
years O
. O
How O
they O
affected O
my O
aunt O
, O
nobody O
knew O
; O
for O
immediately O
upon O
the O
separation O
, O
she O
took O
her O
maiden O
name O
again O
, O
bought O
a O
cottage O
in O
a O
hamlet O
on O
the O
sea-coast O
a O
long O
way O
off O
, O
established O
herself O
there O
as O
a O
single O
woman O
with O
one O
servant O
, O
and O
was O
understood O
to O
live O
secluded O
, O
ever O
afterwards O
, O
in O
an O
inflexible O
retirement O
. O
My O
father O
had O
once O
been O
a O
favourite O
of O
hers O
, O
I O
believe O
; O
but O
she O
was O
mortally O
affronted O
by O
his O
marriage O
, O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
my O
mother O
was O
‘ O
a O
wax O
doll O
’ O
. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
my O
mother O
, O
but O
she O
knew O
her O
to O
be O
not O
yet O
twenty O
. O
My O
father O
and O
Miss O
Betsey O
never O
met O
again O
. O
He O
was O
double O
my O
mother O
’s O
age O
when O
he O
married O
, O
and O
of O
but O
a O
delicate O
constitution O
. O
He O
died O
a O
year O
afterwards O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
, O
six O
months O
before O
I O
came O
into O
the O
world O
. O
This O
was O
the O
state O
of O
matters O
, O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
, O
what O
I O
may O
be O
excused O
for O
calling O
, O
that O
eventful O
and O
important O
Friday O
. O
I O
can O
make O
no O
claim O
therefore O
to O
have O
known O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
how O
matters O
stood O
; O
or O
to O
have O
any O
remembrance O
, O
founded O
on O
the O
evidence O
of O
my O
own O
senses O
, O
of O
what O
follows O
. O
My O
mother O
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
but O
poorly O
in O
health O
, O
and O
very O
low O
in O
spirits O
, O
looking O
at O
it O
through O
her O
tears O
, O
and O
desponding O
heavily O
about O
herself O
and O
the O
fatherless O
little O
stranger O
, O
who O
was O
already O
welcomed O
by O
some O
grosses O
of O
prophetic O
pins O
, O
in O
a O
drawer O
upstairs O
, O
to O
a O
world O
not O
at O
all O
excited O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
arrival O
; O
my O
mother O
, O
I O
say O
, O
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
that O
bright O
, O
windy O
March O
afternoon O
, O
very O
timid O
and O
sad O
, O
and O
very O
doubtful O
of O
ever O
coming O
alive O
out O
of O
the O
trial O
that O
was O
before O
her O
, O
when O
, O
lifting O
her O
eyes O
as O
she O
dried O
them O
, O
to O
the O
window O
opposite O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
strange O
lady O
coming O
up O
the O
garden O
. O
My O
mother O
had O
a O
sure O
foreboding O
at O
the O
second O
glance O
, O
that O
it O
was O
Miss O
Betsey O
. O
The O
setting O
sun O
was O
glowing O
on O
the O
strange O
lady O
, O
over O
the O
garden-fence O
, O
and O
she O
came O
walking O
up O
to O
the O
door O
with O
a O
fell O
rigidity O
of O
figure O
and O
composure O
of O
countenance O
that O
could O
have O
belonged O
to O
nobody O
else O
. O
When O
she O
reached O
the O
house O
, O
she O
gave O
another O
proof O
of O
her O
identity O
. O
My O
father O
had O
often O
hinted O
that O
she O
seldom O
conducted O
herself O
like O
any O
ordinary O
Christian O
; O
and O
now O
, O
instead O
of O
ringing O
the O
bell O
, O
she O
came O
and O
looked O
in O
at O
that O
identical O
window O
, O
pressing O
the O
end O
of O
her O
nose O
against O
the O
glass O
to O
that O
extent O
, O
that O
my O
poor O
dear O
mother O
used O
to O
say O
it O
became O
perfectly O
flat O
and O
white O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
She O
gave O
my O
mother O
such O
a O
turn O
, O
that O
I O
have O
always O
been O
convinced O
I O
am O
indebted O
to O
Miss O
Betsey O
for O
having O
been O
born O
on O
a O
Friday O
. O
My O
mother O
had O
left O
her O
chair O
in O
her O
agitation O
, O
and O
gone O
behind O
it O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
Miss O
Betsey O
, O
looking O
round O
the O
room O
, O
slowly O
and O
inquiringly O
, O
began O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
and O
carried O
her O
eyes O
on O
, O
like O
a O
Saracen O
’s O
Head O
in O
a O
Dutch O
clock O
, O
until O
they O
reached O
my O
mother O
. O
Then O
she O
made O
a O
frown O
and O
a O
gesture O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
like O
one O
who O
was O
accustomed O
to O
be O
obeyed O
, O
to O
come O
and O
open O
the O
door O
. O
My O
mother O
went O
. O
‘ O
Mrs. O
David O
Copperfield O
, O
I O
think O
, O
’ O
said O
Miss O
Betsey O
; O
the O
emphasis O
referring O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
my O
mother O
’s O
mourning O
weeds O
, O
and O
her O
condition O
. O
‘ O
Yes O
, O
’ O
said O
my O
mother O
, O
faintly O
. O
‘ O
Miss O
Trotwood O
, O
’ O
said O
the O
visitor O
. O
‘ O
You O
have O
heard O
of O
her O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
? O
’ O
My O
mother O
answered O
she O
had O
had O
that O
pleasure O
. O
And O
she O
had O
a O
disagreeable O
consciousness O
of O
not O
appearing O
to O
imply O
that O
it O
had O
been O
an O
overpowering O
pleasure O
. O
‘ O
Now O
you O
see O
her O
, O
’ O
said O
Miss O
Betsey O
. O
My O
mother O
bent O
her O
head O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
walk O
in O
. O
They O
went O
into O
the O
parlour O
my O
mother O
had O
come O
from O
, O
the O
fire O
in O
the O
best O
room O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
passage O
not O
being O
lighted O
-- O
not O
having O
been O
lighted O
, O
indeed O
, O
since O
my O
father O
’s O
funeral O
; O
and O
when O
they O
were O
both O
seated O
, O
and O
Miss O
Betsey O
said O
nothing O
, O
my O
mother O
, O
after O
vainly O
trying O
to O
restrain O
herself O
, O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
‘ O
Oh O
tut O
, O
tut O
, O
tut O
! O
’ O
said O
Miss O
Betsey O
, O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
‘ O
Do O
n’t O
do O
that O
! O
Come O
, O
come O
! O
’ O
My O
mother O
could O
n’t O
help O
it O
notwithstanding O
, O
so O
she O
cried O
until O
she O
had O
had O
her O
cry O
out O
. O
‘ O
Take O
off O
your O
cap O
, O
child O
, O
’ O
said O
Miss O
Betsey O
, O
‘ O
and O
let O
me O
see O
you O
. O
’ O
My O
mother O
was O
too O
much O
afraid O
of O
her O
to O
refuse O
compliance O
with O
this O
odd O
request O
, O
if O
she O
had O
any O
disposition O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Therefore O
she O
did O
as O
she O
was O
told O
, O
and O
did O
it O
with O
such O
nervous O
hands O
that O
her O
hair O
( O
which O
was O
luxuriant O
and O
beautiful O
) O
fell O
all O
about O
her O
face O

CHAPTER O
I O
1801 O
. O
-- O
I PRON_PER
have O
just O
returned O
from O
a O
visit O
to O
my NOM_PER
landlord NOM_PER
-- O
the O
solitary O
neighbour O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
troubled O
with O
. O
This O
is O
certainly O
a O
beautiful O
country O
! O
In O
all O
England O
, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
could O
have O
fixed O
on O
a O
situation O
so O
completely O
removed O
from O
the O
stir O
of O
society O
. O
A O
perfect O
misanthropist O
's O
heaven O
: O
and O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
and O
I O
are O
such O
a O
suitable O
pair O
to O
divide O
the O
desolation O
between O
us O
. O
A O
capital O
fellow O
! O
He O
little O
imagined O
how O
my O
heart O
warmed O
towards O
him O
when O
I O
beheld O
his O
black O
eyes O
withdraw O
so O
suspiciously O
under O
their O
brows O
, O
as O
I O
rode O
up O
, O
and O
when O
his O
fingers O
sheltered O
themselves O
, O
with O
a O
jealous O
resolution O
, O
still O
further O
in O
his O
waistcoat O
, O
as O
I O
announced O
my O
name O
. O
' O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
? O
' O
I O
said O
. O
A O
nod O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
' O
Mr. O
Lockwood O
, O
your O
new O
tenant O
, O
sir O
. O
I O
do O
myself O
the O
honour O
of O
calling O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
to O
express O
the O
hope O
that O
I O
have O
not O
inconvenienced O
you O
by O
my O
perseverance O
in O
soliciting O
the O
occupation O
of O
Thrushcross O
Grange O
: O
I O
heard O
yesterday O
you O
had O
had O
some O
thoughts O
-- O
' O
' O
Thrushcross O
Grange O
is O
my O
own O
, O
sir O
, O
' O
he O
interrupted O
, O
wincing O
. O
' O
I O
should O
not O
allow O
any O
one O
to O
inconvenience O
me O
, O
if O
I O
could O
hinder O
it O
-- O
walk O
in O
! O
' O
The O
' O
walk O
in O
' O
was O
uttered O
with O
closed O
teeth O
, O
and O
expressed O
the O
sentiment O
, O
' O
Go O
to O
the O
Deuce O
: O
' O
even O
the O
gate O
over O
which O
he O
leant O
manifested O
no O
sympathising O
movement O
to O
the O
words O
; O
and O
I O
think O
that O
circumstance O
determined O
me O
to O
accept O
the O
invitation O
: O
I O
felt O
interested O
in O
a O
man O
who O
seemed O
more O
exaggeratedly O
reserved O
than O
myself O
. O
When O
he O
saw O
my O
horse O
's O
breast O
fairly O
pushing O
the O
barrier O
, O
he O
did O
put O
out O
his O
hand O
to O
unchain O
it O
, O
and O
then O
sullenly O
preceded O
me O
up O
the O
causeway O
, O
calling O
, O
as O
we O
entered O
the O
court O
, O
-- O
' O
Joseph O
, O
take O
Mr. O
Lockwood O
's O
horse O
; O
and O
bring O
up O
some O
wine O
. O
' O
' O
Here O
we O
have O
the O
whole O
establishment O
of O
domestics O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
' O
was O
the O
reflection O
suggested O
by O
this O
compound O
order O
. O
' O
No O
wonder O
the O
grass O
grows O
up O
between O
the O
flags O
, O
and O
cattle O
are O
the O
only O
hedge-cutters O
. O
' O
Joseph O
was O
an O
elderly O
, O
nay O
, O
an O
old O
man O
: O
very O
old O
, O
perhaps O
, O
though O
hale O
and O
sinewy O
. O
' O
The O
Lord O
help O
us O
! O
' O
he O
soliloquised O
in O
an O
undertone O
of O
peevish O
displeasure O
, O
while O
relieving O
me O
of O
my O
horse O
: O
looking O
, O
meantime O
, O
in O
my O
face O
so O
sourly O
that O
I O
charitably O
conjectured O
he O
must O
have O
need O
of O
divine O
aid O
to O
digest O
his O
dinner O
, O
and O
his O
pious O
ejaculation O
had O
no O
reference O
to O
my O
unexpected O
advent O
. O
Wuthering O
Heights O
is O
the O
name O
of O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
's O
dwelling O
. O
' O
Wuthering O
' O
being O
a O
significant O
provincial O
adjective O
, O
descriptive O
of O
the O
atmospheric O
tumult O
to O
which O
its O
station O
is O
exposed O
in O
stormy O
weather O
. O
Pure O
, O
bracing O
ventilation O
they O
must O
have O
up O
there O
at O
all O
times O
, O
indeed O
: O
one O
may O
guess O
the O
power O
of O
the O
north O
wind O
blowing O
over O
the O
edge O
, O
by O
the O
excessive O
slant O
of O
a O
few O
stunted O
firs O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
house O
; O
and O
by O
a O
range O
of O
gaunt O
thorns O
all O
stretching O
their O
limbs O
one O
way O
, O
as O
if O
craving O
alms O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
Happily O
, O
the O
architect O
had O
foresight O
to O
build O
it O
strong O
: O
the O
narrow O
windows O
are O
deeply O
set O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
the O
corners O
defended O
with O
large O
jutting O
stones O
. O
Before O
passing O
the O
threshold O
, O
I O
paused O
to O
admire O
a O
quantity O
of O
grotesque O
carving O
lavished O
over O
the O
front O
, O
and O
especially O
about O
the O
principal O
door O
; O
above O
which O
, O
among O
a O
wilderness O
of O
crumbling O
griffins O
and O
shameless O
little O
boys O
, O
I O
detected O
the O
date O
' O
1500 O
, O
' O
and O
the O
name O
' O
Hareton O
Earnshaw O
. O
' O
I O
would O
have O
made O
a O
few O
comments O
, O
and O
requested O
a O
short O
history O
of O
the O
place O
from O
the O
surly O
owner O
; O
but O
his O
attitude O
at O
the O
door O
appeared O
to O
demand O
my O
speedy O
entrance O
, O
or O
complete O
departure O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
aggravate O
his O
impatience O
previous O
to O
inspecting O
the O
penetralium O
. O
One O
stop O
brought O
us O
into O
the O
family O
sitting-room O
, O
without O
any O
introductory O
lobby O
or O
passage O
: O
they O
call O
it O
here O
' O
the O
house O
' O
pre-eminently O
. O
It O
includes O
kitchen O
and O
parlour O
, O
generally O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
at O
Wuthering O
Heights O
the O
kitchen O
is O
forced O
to O
retreat O
altogether O
into O
another O
quarter O
: O
at O
least O
I O
distinguished O
a O
chatter O
of O
tongues O
, O
and O
a O
clatter O
of O
culinary O
utensils O
, O
deep O
within O
; O
and O
I O
observed O
no O
signs O
of O
roasting O
, O
boiling O
, O
or O
baking O
, O
about O
the O
huge O
fireplace O
; O
nor O
any O
glitter O
of O
copper O
saucepans O
and O
tin O
cullenders O
on O
the O
walls O
. O
One O
end O
, O
indeed O
, O
reflected O
splendidly O
both O
light O
and O
heat O
from O
ranks O
of O
immense O
pewter O
dishes O
, O
interspersed O
with O
silver O
jugs O
and O
tankards O
, O
towering O
row O
after O
row O
, O
on O
a O
vast O
oak O
dresser O
, O
to O
the O
very O
roof O
. O
The O
latter O
had O
never O
been O
under-drawn O
: O
its O
entire O
anatomy O
lay O
bare O
to O
an O
inquiring O
eye O
, O
except O
where O
a O
frame O
of O
wood O
laden O
with O
oatcakes O
and O
clusters O
of O
legs O
of O
beef O
, O
mutton O
, O
and O
ham O
, O
concealed O
it O
. O
Above O
the O
chimney O
were O
sundry O
villainous O
old O
guns O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
horse-pistols O
: O
and O
, O
by O
way O
of O
ornament O
, O
three O
gaudily-painted O
canisters O
disposed O
along O
its O
ledge O
. O
The O
floor O
was O
of O
smooth O
, O
white O
stone O
; O
the O
chairs O
, O
high-backed O
, O
primitive O
structures O
, O
painted O
green O
: O
one O
or O
two O
heavy O
black O
ones O
lurking O
in O
the O
shade O
. O
In O
an O
arch O
under O
the O
dresser O
reposed O
a O
huge O
, O
liver-coloured O
bitch O
pointer O
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
swarm O
of O
squealing O
puppies O
; O
and O
other O
dogs O
haunted O
other O
recesses O
. O
The O
apartment O
and O
furniture O
would O
have O
been O
nothing O
extraordinary O

belonging O
to O
a O
homely O
, O
northern O
farmer O
, O
with O
a O
stubborn O
countenance O
, O
and O
stalwart O
limbs O
set O
out O
to O
advantage O
in O
knee-breeches O
and O
gaiters O
. O
Such O
an O
individual O
seated O
in O
his O
arm-chair O
, O
his O
mug O
of O
ale O
frothing O
on O
the O
round O
table O
before O
him O
, O
is O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
any O
circuit O
of O
five O
or O
six O
miles O
among O
these O
hills O
, O
if O
you O
go O
at O
the O
right O

But O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
forms O
a O
singular O
contrast O
to O
his O
abode O
and O
style O
of O
living O
. O
He O
is O
a O
dark-skinned O
gipsy O
in O
aspect O
, O
in O
dress O
and O
manners O
a O
gentleman O
: O
that O
is O
, O
as O
much O
a O
gentleman O
as O
many O
a O
country O
squire O
: O
rather O
slovenly O
, O
perhaps O
, O
yet O
not O
looking O
amiss O
with O
his O
negligence O
, O
because O
he O
has O
an O
erect O
and O
handsome O
figure O
; O
and O
rather O
morose O
. O
Possibly O
, O
some O
people O
might O
suspect O
him O
of O
a O
degree O
of O
under-bred O
pride O
; O
I O
have O
a O
sympathetic O
chord O
within O
that O
tells O
me O
it O
is O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
: O
I O
know O
, O
by O
instinct O
, O
his O
reserve O
springs O
from O
an O
aversion O
to O
showy O
displays O
of O
feeling O
-- O
to O
manifestations O
of O
mutual O
kindliness O
. O
He O
'll O
love O
and O
hate O
equally O
under O
cover O
, O
and O
esteem O
it O
a O
species O
of O
impertinence O
to O
be O
loved O
or O
hated O
again O
. O
No O
, O
I O
'm O
running O
on O
too O
fast O
: O
I O
bestow O
my O
own O
attributes O
over-liberally O
on O
him O
. O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
may O
have O
entirely O
dissimilar O
reasons O
for O
keeping O
his O
hand O
out O
of O
the O
way O
when O
he O
meets O
a O
would-be O
acquaintance O
, O
to O
those O
which O
actuate O
me O
. O
Let O
me O
hope O
my O
constitution O
is O
almost O
peculiar O
: O
my O
dear O
mother O
used O
to O
say O
I O
should O
never O
have O
a O
comfortable O
home O
; O
and O
only O
last O
summer O
I O
proved O
myself O
perfectly O
unworthy O
of O
one O
. O
While O
enjoying O
a O
month O
of O
fine O
weather O
at O
the O
sea-coast O
, O
I O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
company O
of O
a O
most O
fascinating O
creature O
: O
a O
real O
goddess O
in O
my O
eyes O
, O
as O
long O
as O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
me O
. O
I O
' O
never O
told O
my O
love O
' O
vocally O
; O
still O
, O
if O
looks O
have O
language O
, O
the O
merest O
idiot O
might O
have O
guessed O
I O
was O
over O
head O
and O
ears O
: O
she O
understood O
me O
at O
last O
, O
and O
looked O
a O
return O
-- O
the O
sweetest O
of O
all O
imaginable O
looks O
. O
And O
what O
did O
I O
do O
? O
I O
confess O
it O
with O
shame O
-- O
shrunk O
icily O
into O
myself O
, O
like O
a O
snail O
; O
at O
every O
glance O
retired O
colder O
and O
farther O
; O
till O
finally O
the O
poor O
innocent O
was O
led O
to O
doubt O
her O
own O
senses O
, O
and O
, O
overwhelmed O
with O
confusion O
at O
her O
supposed O
mistake O
, O
persuaded O
her O
mamma O
to O
decamp O
. O
By O
this O
curious O
turn O
of O
disposition O
I O
have O
gained O
the O
reputation O
of O
deliberate O
heartlessness O
; O
how O
undeserved O
, O
I O
alone O
can O
appreciate O
. O
I O
took O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hearthstone O
opposite O
that O
towards O
which O
my O
landlord O
advanced O
, O
and O
filled O
up O
an O
interval O
of O
silence O
by O
attempting O
to O
caress O
the O
canine O
mother O
, O
who O
had O
left O
her O
nursery O
, O
and O
was O
sneaking O
wolfishly O
to O
the O
back O
of O
my O
legs O
, O
her O
lip O
curled O
up O
, O
and O
her O
white O
teeth O
watering O
for O
a O
snatch O
. O
My O
caress O
provoked O
a O
long O
, O
guttural O
gnarl O
. O
' O
You O
'd O
better O
let O
the O
dog O
alone O
, O
' O
growled O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
in O
unison O
, O
checking O
fiercer O
demonstrations O
with O
a O
punch O
of O
his O
foot O
. O
' O
She O
's O
not O
accustomed O
to O
be O
spoiled O
-- O
not O
kept O
for O
a O
pet O
. O
' O
Then O
, O
striding O
to O
a O
side O
door O
, O
he O
shouted O
again O
, O
' O
Joseph O
! O
' O
Joseph O
mumbled O
indistinctly O
in O
the O
depths O
of O
the O
cellar O
, O
but O
gave O
no O
intimation O
of O
ascending O
; O
so O
his O
master O
dived O
down O
to O
him O
, O
leaving O
me O
_ O
vis-a-vis O
_ O
the O
ruffianly O
bitch O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
grim O
shaggy O
sheep-dogs O
, O
who O
shared O
with O
her O
a O
jealous O
guardianship O
over O
all O
my O
movements O
. O
Not O
anxious O
to O
come O
in O
contact O
with O
their O
fangs O
, O
I O
sat O
still O
; O
but O
, O
imagining O
they O
would O
scarcely O
understand O
tacit O
insults O
, O
I O
unfortunately O
indulged O
in O
winking O
and O
making O
faces O
at O
the O
trio O
, O
and O
some O
turn O
of O
my O
physiognomy O
so O
irritated O
madam O
, O
that O
she O
suddenly O
broke O
into O
a O
fury O
and O
leapt O
on O
my O
knees O
. O
I O
flung O
her O
back O
, O
and O
hastened O
to O
interpose O
the O
table O
between O
us O
. O
This O
proceeding O
aroused O
the O
whole O
hive O
: O
half-a-dozen O
four-footed O
fiends O
, O
of O
various O
sizes O
and O
ages O
, O
issued O
from O
hidden O
dens O
to O
the O
common O
centre O
. O
I O
felt O
my O
heels O
and O
coat-laps O
peculiar O
subjects O
of O
assault O
; O
and O
parrying O
off O
the O
larger O
combatants O
as O
effectually O
as O
I O
could O
with O
the O
poker O
, O
I O
was O
constrained O
to O
demand O
, O
aloud O
, O
assistance O
from O
some O
of O
the O
household O
in O
re-establishing O
peace O
. O
Mr. O
Heathcliff O
and O
his O
man O
climbed O
the O
cellar O
steps O
with O
vexatious O
phlegm O
: O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
moved O
one O
second O
faster O
than O
usual O
, O
though O
the O
hearth O
was O
an O
absolute O
tempest O
of O
worrying O
and O
yelping O
. O
Happily O
, O
an O
inhabitant O
of O
the O
kitchen O
made O
more O
despatch O
: O
a O
lusty O
dame O
, O
with O
tucked-up O
gown O
, O
bare O
arms O
, O
and O
fire-flushed O
cheeks O
, O
rushed O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
us O
flourishing O
a O
frying-pan O
: O
and O
used O
that O
weapon O
, O
and O
her O
tongue O
, O
to O
such O
purpose O
, O
that O
the O
storm O
subsided O
magically O
, O
and O
she O
only O
remained O
, O
heaving O
like O
a O
sea O
after O
a O
high O
wind O
, O
when O
her O
master O
entered O
on O
the O
scene O
. O
' O
What O
the O
devil O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
' O
he O
asked O
, O
eyeing O
me O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
I O
could O
ill O
endure O
, O
after O
this O
inhospitable O
treatment O

' O
What O
the O

indeed O
! O
' O
I O

' O
The O

CHAPTER O
I O
. O
YOU PRON_PER
do O
n't O
know O
about O
me PRON_PER
without O
you PRON_PER
have O
read O
a O
book O
by O
the O
name O
of O
The O
Adventures O
of O
Tom PROP_PER
Sawyer PROP_PER
; O
but O
that O
ai O
n't O
no O
matter O
. O
That O
book O
was O
made O
by O
Mr. PROP_PER
Mark PROP_PER
Twain PROP_PER
, O
and O
he PRON_PER
told O
the O
truth O
, O
mainly O
. O
There O
was O
things O
which O
he PRON_PER
stretched O
, O
but O
mainly O
he PRON_PER
told O
the O
truth O
. O
That O
is O
nothing O
. O
I PRON_PER
never O
seen O
anybody NOM_PER
but O
lied O
one O
time O
or O
another O
, O
without O
it O
was O
Aunt PROP_PER
Polly PROP_PER
, O
or O
the NOM_PER
widow NOM_PER
, O
or O
maybe O
Mary PROP_PER
. O
Aunt PROP_PER
Polly PROP_PER
-- O
Tom PROP_PER
's O
Aunt O
Polly O
, O
she O
is O
-- O
and O
Mary O
, O
and O
the O
Widow O
Douglas O
is O
all O
told O
about O
in O
that O
book O
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
a O
true O
book O
, O
with O
some O
stretchers O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
. O
Now O
the O
way O
that O
the O
book O
winds O
up O
is O
this O
: O
Tom O
and O
me O
found O
the O
money O
that O
the O
robbers O
hid O
in O
the O
cave O
, O
and O
it O
made O
us O
rich O
. O
We O
got O
six O
thousand O
dollars O
apiece O
-- O
all O
gold O
. O
It O
was O
an O
awful O
sight O
of O
money O
when O
it O
was O
piled O
up O
. O
Well O
, O
Judge O
Thatcher O
he O
took O
it O
and O
put O
it O
out O
at O
interest O
, O
and O
it O
fetched O
us O
a O
dollar O
a O
day O
apiece O
all O
the O
year O
round O
-- O
more O
than O
a O
body O
could O
tell O
what O
to O
do O
with O
. O
The O
Widow O
Douglas O
she O
took O
me O
for O
her O
son O
, O
and O
allowed O
she O
would O
sivilize O
me O
; O
but O
it O
was O
rough O
living O
in O
the O
house O
all O
the O
time O
, O
considering O
how O
dismal O
regular O
and O
decent O
the O
widow O
was O
in O
all O
her O
ways O
; O
and O
so O
when O
I O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
no O
longer O
I O
lit O
out O
. O
I O
got O
into O
my O
old O
rags O
and O
my O
sugar-hogshead O
again O
, O
and O
was O
free O
and O
satisfied O
. O
But O
Tom O
Sawyer O
he O
hunted O
me O
up O
and O
said O
he O
was O
going O
to O
start O
a O
band O
of O
robbers O
, O
and O
I O
might O
join O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
to O
the O
widow O
and O
be O
respectable O
. O
So O
I O
went O
back O
. O
The O
widow O
she O
cried O
over O
me O
, O
and O
called O
me O
a O
poor O
lost O
lamb O
, O
and O
she O
called O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
names O
, O
too O
, O
but O
she O
never O
meant O
no O
harm O
by O
it O
. O
She O
put O
me O
in O
them O
new O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
do O
nothing O
but O
sweat O
and O
sweat O
, O
and O
feel O
all O
cramped O
up O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
the O
old O
thing O
commenced O
again O
. O
The O
widow O
rung O
a O
bell O
for O
supper O
, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
come O
to O
time O
. O
When O
you O
got O
to O
the O
table O
you O
could O
n't O
go O
right O
to O
eating O
, O
but O
you O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
widow O
to O
tuck O
down O
her O
head O
and O
grumble O
a O
little O
over O
the O
victuals O
, O
though O
there O
war O
n't O
really O
anything O
the O
matter O
with O
them O
, O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
nothing O
only O
everything O
was O
cooked O
by O
itself O
. O
In O
a O
barrel O
of O
odds O
and O
ends O
it O
is O
different O
; O
things O
get O
mixed O
up O
, O
and O
the O
juice O
kind O
of O
swaps O
around O
, O
and O
the O
things O
go O
better O
. O
After O
supper O
she O
got O
out O
her O
book O
and O
learned O
me O
about O
Moses O
and O
the O
Bulrushers O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
a O
sweat O
to O
find O
out O
all O
about O
him O
; O
but O
by O
and O
by O
she O
let O
it O
out O
that O
Moses O
had O
been O
dead O
a O
considerable O
long O
time O
; O
so O
then O
I O
did O
n't O
care O
no O
more O
about O
him O
, O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
no O
stock O
in O
dead O
people O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
I O
wanted O
to O
smoke O
, O
and O
asked O
the O
widow O
to O
let O
me O
. O
But O
she O
would O
n't O
. O
She O
said O
it O
was O
a O
mean O
practice O
and O
was O
n't O
clean O
, O
and O
I O
must O
try O
to O
not O
do O
it O
any O
more O
. O
That O
is O
just O
the O
way O
with O
some O
people O
. O
They O
get O
down O
on O
a O
thing O
when O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O
Here O
she O
was O
a-bothering O
about O
Moses O
, O
which O
was O
no O
kin O
to O
her O
, O
and O
no O
use O
to O
anybody O
, O
being O
gone O
, O
you O
see O
, O
yet O
finding O
a O
power O
of O
fault O
with O
me O
for O
doing O
a O
thing O
that O
had O
some O
good O
in O
it O
. O
And O
she O
took O
snuff O
, O
too O
; O
of O
course O
that O
was O
all O
right O
, O
because O
she O
done O
it O
herself O
. O
Her O
sister O
, O
Miss O
Watson O
, O
a O
tolerable O
slim O
old O
maid O
, O
with O
goggles O
on O
, O
had O
just O
come O
to O
live O
with O
her O
, O
and O
took O
a O
set O
at O
me O
now O
with O
a O
spelling-book O
. O
She O
worked O
me O
middling O
hard O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
then O
the O
widow O
made O
her O
ease O
up O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
stood O
it O
much O
longer O
. O
Then O
for O
an O
hour O
it O
was O
deadly O
dull O
, O
and O
I O
was O
fidgety O
. O
Miss O
Watson O
would O
say O
, O
" O
Do O
n't O
put O
your O
feet O
up O
there O
, O
Huckleberry O
; O
" O
and O
" O
Do O
n't O
scrunch O
up O
like O
that O
, O
Huckleberry O
-- O
set O
up O
straight O
; O
" O
and O
pretty O
soon O
she O
would O
say O
, O
" O
Do O
n't O
gap O
and O
stretch O
like O
that O
, O
Huckleberry O
-- O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
try O
to O
behave O
? O
" O
Then O
she O
told O
me O
all O
about O
the O
bad O
place O
, O
and O
I O
said O
I O
wished O
I O
was O
there O
. O
She O
got O
mad O
then O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
mean O
no O
harm O
. O
All O
I O
wanted O
was O
to O
go O
somewheres O
; O
all O
I O
wanted O
was O
a O
change O
, O
I O
war O
n't O
particular O
. O
She O
said O
it O
was O
wicked O
to O
say O
what O
I O
said O
; O
said O
she O
would O
n't O
say O
it O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
; O
she O
was O
going O
to O
live O
so O
as O
to O
go O
to O
the O
good O
place O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
no O
advantage O
in O
going O
where O
she O
was O
going O
, O
so O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
I O
would O
n't O
try O
for O
it O
. O
But O
I O
never O
said O
so O
, O
because O
it O
would O
only O
make O
trouble O
, O
and O
would O
n't O
do O
no O
good O
. O
Now O
she O
had O
got O
a O
start O
, O
and O
she O
went O
on O
and O
told O
me O
all O
about O
the O
good O
place O
. O
She O
said O
all O
a O
body O
would O
have O
to O
do O
there O
was O
to O
go O
around O
all O
day O
long O
with O
a O
harp O
and O
sing O
, O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O
So O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
much O
of O
it O
. O
But O
I O
never O
said O
so O
. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
reckoned O
Tom O
Sawyer O
would O
go O
there O
, O
and O
she O
said O
not O
by O
a O
considerable O
sight O
. O
I O
was O
glad O
about O
that O
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
him O
and O
me O
to O
be O
together O
. O
Miss O
Watson O
she O
kept O
pecking O
at O
me O
, O
and O
it O
got O
tiresome O
and O
lonesome O
. O
By O
and O
by O
they O
fetched O
the O
niggers O
in O
and O
had O
prayers O
, O
and O
then O
everybody O
was O
off O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
went O
up O
to O
my O
room O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
candle O
, O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
table O
. O
Then O
I O
set O
down O
in O
a O
chair O
by O
the O
window O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
something O
cheerful O
, O
but O
it O
war O
n't O
no O
use O
. O
I O
felt O
so O
lonesome O
I O
most O
wished O
I O
was O
dead O
. O
The O
stars O
were O
shining O
, O
and O
the O
leaves O
rustled O
in O
the O
woods O
ever O
so O
mournful O
; O
and O
I O
heard O
an O
owl O
, O
away O
off O
, O
who-whooing O
about O
somebody O
that O
was O
dead O
, O
and O
a O
whippowill O
and O
a O
dog O
crying O
about O
somebody O
that O
was O
going O
to O
die O
; O
and O
the O
wind O
was O
trying O
to O
whisper O
something O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
make O
out O
what O
it O
was O
, O
and O
so O
it O
made O
the O
cold O
shivers O
run O
over O
me O
. O
Then O
away O
out O
in O
the O
woods O
I O
heard O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
sound O
that O
a O
ghost O
makes O
when O
it O
wants O
to O
tell O
about O
something O
that O
's O
on O
its O
mind O
and O
ca O
n't O
make O
itself O
understood O
, O
and O
so O
ca O
n't O
rest O
easy O
in O
its O
grave O
, O
and O
has O
to O
go O
about O
that O
way O
every O
night O
grieving O
. O
I O
got O
so O
down-hearted O
and O
scared O
I O
did O
wish O
I O
had O
some O
company O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
a O
spider O
went O
crawling O
up O
my O
shoulder O
, O
and O
I O
flipped O
it O
off O
and O
it O
lit O
in O
the O
candle O
; O
and O
before O
I O
could O
budge O
it O
was O
all O
shriveled O
up O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
anybody O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
that O
was O
an O
awful O
bad O
sign O
and O
would O
fetch O
me O
some O
bad O
luck O
, O
so O
I O
was O
scared O
and O
most O
shook O
the O
clothes O
off O
of O
me O
. O
I O
got O
up O
and O
turned O
around O
in O
my O
tracks O
three O
times O
and O
crossed O
my O
breast O
every O
time O
; O
and O
then O
I O
tied O
up O
a O
little O
lock O
of O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
thread O
to O
keep O
witches O
away O
. O
But O
I O
had O
n't O
no O
confidence O
. O
You O
do O
that O
when O
you O
've O
lost O
a O
horseshoe O
that O
you O
've O
found O
, O
instead O
of O
nailing O
it O
up O
over O
the O
door O
, O
but O
I O
had O
n't O
ever O
heard O
anybody O
say O
it O
was O
any O
way O
to O
keep O
off O
bad O
luck O
when O
you O
'd O
killed O
a O
spider O
. O
I O
set O
down O
again O
, O
a-shaking O
all O
over O
, O
and O
got O
out O
my O
pipe O
for O
a O
smoke O
; O
for O
the O
house O
was O
all O
as O
still O
as O
death O
now O
, O
and O
so O
the O
widow O
would O
n't O
know O
. O
Well O
, O
after O
a O
long O
time O
I O
heard O
the O
clock O
away O
off O
in O
the O
town O
go O
boom O
-- O
boom O
-- O
boom O
-- O
twelve O
licks O
; O
and O
all O
still O
again O
-- O
stiller O
than O
ever O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
I O
heard O
a O
twig O
snap O
down O
in O
the O
dark O
amongst O
the O
trees O
-- O
something O
was O
a O
stirring O
. O
I O
set O
still O
and O
listened O
. O
Directly O
I O
could O
just O
barely O
hear O
a O
" O
me-yow O
! O
me-yow O
! O
" O
down O
there O
. O
That O
was O
good O
! O
Says O
I O
, O
" O
me-yow O
! O
me-yow O
! O
" O
as O
soft O
as O
I O
could O
, O
and O
then O
I O
put O
out O
the O
light O
and O
scrambled O
out O
of O
the O
window O
on O
to O
the O
shed O
. O
Then O
I O
slipped O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
crawled O
in O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
, O
sure O
enough O
, O
there O
was O
Tom O
Sawyer O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O
CHAPTER O
II O
. O
WE O
went O
tiptoeing O
along O
a O
path O
amongst O
the O
trees O
back O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
widow O
's O
garden O
, O
stooping O
down O
so O
as O
the O
branches O
would O
n't O
scrape O
our O
heads O
. O
When O
we O
was O
passing O
by O
the O
kitchen O
I O
fell O
over O
a O
root O
and O
made O
a O
noise O
. O
We O
scrouched O
down O
and O
laid O
still O
. O
Miss O
Watson O
's O
big O
nigger O
, O
named O
Jim O
, O
was O
setting O
in O
the O
kitchen O
door O
; O
we O
could O
see O
him O
pretty O
clear O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
light O
behind O
him O
. O
He O
got O
up O
and O
stretched O
his O
neck O
out O
about O
a O
minute O
, O
listening O
. O
Then O
he O
says O
: O
" O
Who O
dah O
? O
" O
He O
listened O
some O
more O
; O
then O
he O
come O
tiptoeing O
down O
and O
stood O
right O
between O
us O
; O
we O
could O
a O
touched O
him O
, O
nearly O
. O
Well O
, O
likely O
it O
was O
minutes O
and O
minutes O
that O
there O
war O
n't O
a O
sound O
, O
and O
we O
all O
there O
so O
close O
together O
. O
There O
was O
a O
place O
on O
my O
ankle O
that O
got O
to O
itching O
, O
but O
I O
das O
n't O
scratch O
it O
; O
and O
then O
my O
ear O
begun O
to O
itch O
; O
and O
next O
my O
back O
, O
right O
between O
my O
shoulders O
. O
Seemed O
like O
I O
'd O
die O
if O
I O
could O
n't O
scratch O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
thing O
plenty O
times O
since O
. O
If O
you O
are O
with O
the O
quality O
, O
or O
at O
a O
funeral O
, O
or O
trying O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
when O
you O
ai O
n't O
sleepy O
-- O
if O
you O
are O
anywheres O
where O
it O
wo O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
to O
scratch O
, O
why O
you O
will O
itch O
all O
over O
in O
upwards O
of O
a O
thousand O
places O
. O
Pretty O
soon O
Jim O
says O
: O
" O
Say O
, O
who O
is O
you O
? O
Whar O
is O
you O
? O
Dog O
my O
cats O
ef O
I O
didn O
' O
hear O
sumf O
' O
n. O
Well O
, O
I O
know O
what O
I O
's O
gwyne O
to O
do O
: O
I O
's O
gwyne O
to O
set O
down O
here O
and O
listen O
tell O
I O
hears O
it O
agin O
. O
" O
So O
he O
set O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
betwixt O
me O
and O
Tom O
. O
He O
leaned O
his O
back O
up O
against O
a O
tree O
, O
and O
stretched O
his O
legs O
out O
till O
one O
of O
them O
most O
touched O
one O
of O
mine O
. O
My O
nose O
begun O
to O
itch O
. O
It O
itched O
till O
the O
tears O
come O
into O
my O
eyes O
. O
But O
I O
das O
n't O
scratch O
. O
Then O
it O
begun O
to O
itch O
on O
the O
inside O
. O
Next O
I O
got O
to O
itching O
underneath O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
was O
going O
to O
set O
still O
. O
This O
miserableness O
went O
on O
as O
much O
as O
six O
or O
seven O
minutes O
; O
but O
it O
seemed O
a O
sight O
longer O
than O
that O
. O
I O
was O
itching O
in O
eleven O
different O
places O
now O
. O
I O
reckoned O
I O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
more O
'n O
a O
minute O
longer O
, O
but O
I O
set O
my O
teeth O
hard O
and O
got O
ready O
to O
try O
. O
Just O
then O
Jim O
begun O
to O
breathe O
heavy O
; O
next O
he O
begun O
to O
snore O
-- O
and O
then O
I O
was O
pretty O
soon O
comfortable O
again O
. O

HALFWAY O
down O
a O
by-street O
of O
one O
of O
our PRON_PER
New O
England O
towns O
stands O
a O
rusty O
wooden O
house O
, O
with O
seven O
acutely O
peaked O
gables O
, O
facing O
towards O
various O
points O
of O
the O

, O
and O
a O
huge O
, O
clustered O
chimney O
in O
the O
midst O
. O
The O
street O
is O
Pyncheon O
Street O
; O
the O
house O
is O
the O
old O
Pyncheon O
House O
; O
and O
an O
elm-tree O
, O
of O
wide O
circumference O
, O
rooted O
before O
the O
door O
, O
is O
familiar O
to O
every NOM_PER
town-born NOM_PER

by O
the O
title O
of O
the O
Pyncheon O
Elm O
. O
On O
my PRON_PER
occasional O
visits O
to O
the O
town O
aforesaid O
, O
I PRON_PER
seldom O
failed O
to O
turn O
down O
Pyncheon O
Street O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
passing O
through O
the O
shadow O
of O
these O
two O
antiquities O
, O
-- O
the O
great O
elm-tree O
and O
the O
weather-beaten O
edifice O
. O
The O
aspect O
of O
the O
venerable O
mansion O
has O
always O
affected O
me PRON_PER
like O
a O
human O
countenance O
, O
bearing O
the O
traces O
not O
merely O
of O
outward O
storm O
and O
sunshine O
, O
but O
expressive O
also O
, O
of O
the O
long O
lapse O
of O
mortal O
life O
, O
and O
accompanying O
vicissitudes O
that O
have O
passed O
within O
. O
Were O
these O
to O
be O
worthily O
recounted O
, O
they O
would O
form O
a O
narrative O
of O
no O
small O
interest O
and O
instruction O
, O
and O
possessing O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
certain O
remarkable O
unity O
, O
which O
might O
almost O
seem O
the O
result O
of O
artistic O
arrangement O
. O
But O
the O
story O
would O
include O
a O
chain O
of O
events O
extending O
over O
the O
better O
part O
of O
two O
centuries O
, O
and O
, O
written O
out O
with O
reasonable O
amplitude O
, O
would O
fill O
a O
bigger O
folio O
volume O
, O
or O
a O
longer O
series O
of O
duodecimos O
, O
than O
could O
prudently O
be O
appropriated O
to O
the O
annals O
of O
all O
New O
England O
during O
a O
similar O
period O
. O
It O
consequently O
becomes O
imperative O
to O
make O
short O
work O
with O
most O
of O
the O
traditionary O
lore O
of O
which O
the O
old O
Pyncheon O
House O
, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
the O
House O
of O
the O
Seven O
Gables O
, O
has O
been O
the O
theme O
. O
With O
a O
brief O
sketch O
, O
therefore O
, O
of O
the O
circumstances O
amid O
which O
the O
foundation O
of O
the O
house O
was O
laid O
, O
and O
a O
rapid O
glimpse O
at O
its O
quaint O
exterior O
, O
as O
it O
grew O
black O
in O
the O
prevalent O
east O
wind O
, O
-- O
pointing O
, O
too O
, O
here O
and O
there O
, O
at O
some O
spot O
of O
more O
verdant O
mossiness O
on O
its O
roof O
and O
walls O
, O
-- O
we PRON_PER
shall O
commence O
the O
real O
action O
of O
our PRON_PER
tale O
at O
an O
epoch O
not O
very O
remote O
from O
the O
present O
day O
. O
Still O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
long O
past O
-- O
a O
reference O
to O
forgotten O
events O
and O
personages NOM_PER
, O
and O
to O
manners O
, O
feelings O
, O
and O
opinions O
, O
almost O
or O
wholly O
obsolete O
-- O
which O
, O
if O
adequately O
translated O
to O
the O
reader O
, O
would O
serve O
to O
illustrate O
how O
much O
of O
old O
material O
goes O
to O
make O
up O
the O
freshest O
novelty O
of O
human O
life O
. O
Hence O
, O
too O
, O
might O
be O
drawn O
a O
weighty O
lesson O
from O
the O
little-regarded O
truth O
, O
that O
the O
act O
of O
the NOM_PER
passing NOM_PER
generation NOM_PER
is O
the O
germ O
which O
may O
and O
must O
produce O
good O
or O
evil O
fruit O
in O
a O
far-distant O
time O

that O
, O
together O
with O
the O
seed O
of O
the O
merely O
temporary O
crop O

which O
mortals NOM_PER
term O
expediency O
, O
they PRON_PER
inevitably O
sow O
the O
acorns O
of O
a O
more O

The O

the O

the O

subject O
is O
derived O
chiefly O
from O
tradition O
. O
It O
would O
be O
bold O
, O
therefore O
, O
and O
possibly O
unjust O
, O
to O
venture O
a O
decisive O
opinion O
as O
to O
its O
merits O
; O
although O
it O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
at O
least O
a O
matter O
of O
doubt O
, O
whether O
Colonel O
Pyncheon O
's O
claim O
were O
not O
unduly O
stretched O
, O
in O
order O
to O
make O
it O
cover O
the O
small O
metes O
and O
bounds O
of O
Matthew O
Maule O
. O
What O
greatly O
strengthens O
such O
a O
suspicion O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
controversy O
between O
two O
ill-matched O
antagonists O
-- O
at O
a O
period O
, O
moreover O
, O
laud O
it O
as O
we O
may O
, O
when O
personal O
influence O
had O
far O
more O
weight O
than O
now O
-- O
remained O
for O
years O
undecided O
, O
and O
came O
to O
a O
close O
only O
with O
the O
death O
of O
the O
party O
occupying O
the O
disputed O
soil O
. O
The O
mode O
of O
his O
death O
, O
too O
, O
affects O
the O
mind O
differently O
, O
in O
our O
day O
, O
from O
what O
it O
did O
a O
century O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O
It O
was O
a O
death O
that O
blasted O
with O
strange O
horror O
the O
humble O
name O
of O
the O
dweller O
in O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
almost O
a O
religious O
act O
to O
drive O
the O
plough O
over O
the O
little O
area O
of O
his O
habitation O
, O
and O
obliterate O
his O
place O
and O
memory O
from O
among O
men O
. O
Old O
Matthew O
Maule O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
was O
executed O
for O
the O
crime O
of O
witchcraft O
. O
He O
was O
one O
of O
the O
martyrs O
to O
that O
terrible O
delusion O
, O
which O
should O
teach O
us O
, O
among O
its O
other O
morals O
, O
that O
the O
influential O
classes O
, O
and O
those O
who O
take O
upon O
themselves O
to O
be O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
, O
are O
fully O
liable O
to O
all O
the O
passionate O
error O
that O
has O
ever O
characterized O
the O
maddest O
mob O
. O
Clergymen O
, O
judges O
, O
statesmen O
, O
-- O
the O
wisest O
, O
calmest O
, O
holiest O
persons O
of O
their O
day O
stood O
in O
the O
inner O
circle O
round O
about O
the O
gallows O
, O
loudest O
to O
applaud O
the O
work O
of O
blood O
, O
latest O
to O
confess O
themselves O
miserably O
deceived O
. O
If O
any O
one O
part O
of O
their O
proceedings O
can O
be O
said O
to O
deserve O
less O
blame O
than O
another O
, O
it O
was O
the O
singular O
indiscrimination O
with O
which O
they O
persecuted O
, O
not O
merely O
the O
poor O
and O
aged O
, O
as O
in O
former O
judicial O
massacres O
, O
but O
people O
of O
all O
ranks O
; O
their O
own O
equals O
, O
brethren O
, O
and O
wives O
. O
Amid O
the O
disorder O
of O
such O
various O
ruin O
, O
it O
is O
not O
strange O
that O
a O
man O
of O
inconsiderable O
note O
, O
like O
Maule O
, O
should O
have O
trodden O
the O
martyr O
's O
path O
to O
the O
hill O
of O
execution O
almost O
unremarked O
in O
the O
throng O
of O
his O
fellow O
sufferers O
. O
But O
, O
in O
after O
days O
, O
when O
the O
frenzy O
of O
that O
hideous O
epoch O
had O
subsided O
, O
it O
was O
remembered O
how O
loudly O
Colonel O
Pyncheon O
had O
joined O
in O
the O
general O
cry O
, O
to O
purge O
the O
land O
from O
witchcraft O
; O
nor O
did O
it O
fail O
to O
be O
whispered O
, O
that O
there O
was O
an O
invidious O
acrimony O
in O
the O
zeal O
with O
which O
he O
had O
sought O
the O
condemnation O
of O
Matthew O
Maule O
. O
It O
was O
well O
known O
that O
the O
victim O
had O
recognized O
the O
bitterness O
of O
personal O
enmity O
in O
his O
persecutor O
's O
conduct O
towards O
him O
, O
and O
that O
he O
declared O
himself O
hunted O
to O
death O
for O
his O
spoil O
. O
At O
the O
moment O
of O
execution O
-- O
with O
the O
halter O
about O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
while O
Colonel O
Pyncheon O
sat O
on O
horseback O
, O
grimly O
gazing O
at O
the O
scene O
Maule O
had O
addressed O
him O
from O
the O
scaffold O
, O
and O
uttered O
a O
prophecy O
, O
of O
which O
history O
, O
as O
well O
as O
fireside O
tradition O
, O
has O
preserved O
the O
very O
words O
. O
" O
God O
, O
" O
said O
the O
dying O
man O
, O
pointing O
his O
finger O
, O
with O
a O
ghastly O
look O
, O
at O
the O
undismayed O
countenance O
of O
his O
enemy O
, O
-- O
" O
God O
will O
give O
him O
blood O
to O
drink O
! O
" O
After O
the O
reputed O
wizard O
's O
death O
, O
his O
humble O
homestead O
had O
fallen O
an O
easy O
spoil O
into O
Colonel O
Pyncheon O
's O
grasp O
. O
When O
it O
was O
understood O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Colonel O
intended O
to O
erect O
a O
family O
mansion-spacious O
, O
ponderously O
framed O
of O
oaken O
timber O
, O
and O
calculated O
to O
endure O
for O
many O
generations O
of O
his O
posterity O
over O
the O
spot O
first O
covered O
by O
the O
log-built O
hut O
of O
Matthew O
Maule O
, O
there O
was O
much O
shaking O
of O
the O
head O
among O
the O
village O
gossips O
. O
Without O
absolutely O
expressing O
a O
doubt O
whether O
the O
stalwart O
Puritan O
had O
acted O
as O
a O
man O
of O
conscience O
and O
integrity O
throughout O
the O
proceedings O
which O
have O
been O
sketched O
, O
they O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
hinted O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
build O
his O
house O
over O
an O
unquiet O
grave O
. O
His O
home O
would O
include O
the O
home O
of O
the O
dead O
and O
buried O
wizard O
, O
and O
would O
thus O
afford O
the O
ghost O
of O
the O
latter O
a O
kind O
of O
privilege O
to O
haunt O
its O
new O
apartments O
, O
and O
the O
chambers O
into O
which O
future O
bridegrooms O
were O
to O
lead O
their O
brides O
, O
and O
where O
children O
of O
the O
Pyncheon O
blood O
were O
to O
be O
born O
. O
The O
terror O
and O
ugliness O
of O
Maule O
's O
crime O
, O
and O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
his O
punishment O
, O
would O
darken O
the O
freshly O
plastered O
walls O
, O
and O
infect O
them O
early O
with O
the O
scent O
of O
an O
old O
and O
melancholy O
house O
. O
Why O
, O
then O
, O
-- O
while O
so O
much O
of O
the O
soil O
around O
him O
was O
bestrewn O
with O
the O
virgin O
forest O
leaves O
, O
-- O
why O
should O
Colonel O
Pyncheon O
prefer O
a O
site O
that O
had O
already O
been O
accurst O
? O
But O
the O
Puritan O
soldier O
and O
magistrate O
was O
not O
a O
man O
to O
be O
turned O
aside O
from O
his O
well-considered O
scheme O
, O
either O
by O
dread O
of O
the O
wizard O
's O
ghost O
, O
or O
by O
flimsy O
sentimentalities O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
however O
specious O
. O
Had O
he O
been O
told O
of O
a O
bad O
air O
, O
it O
might O
have O
moved O
him O
somewhat O
; O
but O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
encounter O
an O
evil O
spirit O
on O
his O
own O
ground O
. O
Endowed O
with O
commonsense O
, O
as O
massive O
and O
hard O
as O
blocks O
of O
granite O
, O
fastened O
together O
by O
stern O
rigidity O
of O
purpose O
, O
as O
with O
iron O
clamps O
, O
he O
followed O
out O
his O
original O
design O
, O
probably O
without O
so O
much O
as O
imagining O
an O
objection O
to O
it O
. O
On O
the O
score O
of O
delicacy O
, O
or O
any O
scrupulousness O
which O
a O
finer O
sensibility O
might O
have O
taught O
him O
, O
the O
Colonel O
, O
like O
most O
of O
his O
breed O
and O
generation O
, O
was O
impenetrable O
. O
He O
therefore O
dug O
his O
cellar O
, O
and O
laid O
the O
deep O
foundations O
of O
his O
mansion O
, O
on O
the O
square O
of O
earth O
whence O
Matthew O
Maule O
, O
forty O
years O
before O
, O
had O
first O
swept O
away O
the O
fallen O
leaves O
. O
It O
was O
a O
curious O
, O
and O
, O
as O
some O
people O
thought O
, O
an O
ominous O
fact O
, O
that O
, O
very O
soon O
after O
the O
workmen O
began O
their O
operations O
, O
the O
spring O
of O
water O
, O
above O
mentioned O
, O
entirely O
lost O
the O
deliciousness O
of O
its O
pristine O
quality O
. O
Whether O
its O
sources O
were O
disturbed O
by O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
new O
cellar O
, O
or O
whatever O
subtler O
cause O
might O
lurk O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
it O
is O
certain O
that O
the O
water O
of O
Maule O
's O
Well O
, O
as O
it O
continued O
to O
be O
called O
, O
grew O
hard O
and O
brackish O
. O
Even O
such O
we O
find O
it O
now O
; O
and O
any O
old O
woman O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
will O
certify O
that O
it O
is O
productive O
of O
intestinal O
mischief O
to O
those O
who O
quench O
their O
thirst O
there O
. O
The O
reader O
may O
deem O
it O
singular O
that O
the O
head O
carpenter O
of O
the O
new O
edifice O
was O
no O
other O
than O
the O
son O
of O
the O
very O
man O
from O
whose O
dead O
gripe O
the O
property O
of O
the O
soil O
had O
been O
wrested O
. O
Not O
improbably O
he O
was O
the O
best O
workman O
of O
his O
time O
; O
or O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
Colonel O
thought O
it O
expedient O
, O
or O
was O
impelled O
by O
some O
better O
feeling O
, O
thus O
openly O
to O
cast O
aside O
all O
animosity O
against O
the O
race O
of O
his O
fallen O
antagonist O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
out O
of O
keeping O
with O
the O
general O
coarseness O
and O
matter-of-fact O
character O
of O
the O
age O
, O
that O
the O
son O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
earn O
an O
honest O
penny O
, O
or O
, O
rather O
, O
a O
weighty O
amount O
of O
sterling O
pounds O
, O
from O
the O
purse O
of O
his O
father O
's O
deadly O
enemy O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
Thomas O
Maule O
became O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
House O
of O
the O
Seven O
Gables O
, O
and O
performed O
his O
duty O
so O
faithfully O
that O
the O
timber O
framework O
fastened O
by O
his O
hands O
still O
holds O
together O

I O
may O
credit O
the O
seductive O
influence O
of O
an O
old O
vintage O
upon O
the O
narrator O
for O
the O
beginning O
of O
it O
, O
and O
my O
own O
skeptical O
incredulity O
during O
the O
days O
that O
followed O
for O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
strange O
tale O
. O
When O
my O
convivial O
host O
discovered O
that O
he O
had O
told O
me O
so O
much O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
prone O
to O
doubtfulness O
, O
his O
foolish O
pride O
assumed O
the O
task O
the O
old O
vintage O
had O
commenced O
, O
and O
so O
he O
unearthed O
written O
evidence O
in O
the O
form O
of O
musty O
manuscript O
, O
and O
dry O
official O
records O
of O
the O
British O
Colonial O
Office O
to O
support O
many O
of O
the O
salient O
features O
of O
his O
remarkable O
narrative O
. O
I O
do O
not O
say O
the O
story O
is O
true O
, O
for O
I O
did O
not O
witness O
the O
happenings O
which O
it O
portrays O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
the O
telling O
of O
it O
to O
you O
I O
have O
taken O
fictitious O
names O
for O
the O
principal O
characters O
quite O
sufficiently O
evidences O
the O
sincerity O
of O
my O
own O
belief O
that O
it O
MAY O
be O
true O
. O
The O
yellow O
, O
mildewed O
pages O
of O
the O
diary O
of O
a O
man O
long O
dead O
, O
and O
the O
records O
of O
the O
Colonial O
Office O
dovetail O
perfectly O
with O
the O
narrative O
of O
my O
convivial O
host O
, O
and O
so O
I O
give O
you O
the O
story O
as O
I O
painstakingly O
pieced O
it O
out O
from O
these O
several O
various O
agencies O
. O
If O
you O
do O
not O
find O
it O
credible O
you O
will O
at O
least O
be O
as O
one O
with O
me O
in O
acknowledging O
that O
it O
is O
unique O
, O
remarkable O
, O
and O
interesting O
. O
From O
the O
records O
of O
the O
Colonial O
Office O
and O
from O
the O
dead O
man O
's O
diary O
we O
learn O
that O
a O
certain O
young O
English O
nobleman O
, O
whom O
we O
shall O
call O
John O
Clayton O
, O
Lord O
Greystoke O
, O
was O
commissioned O
to O
make O
a O
peculiarly O
delicate O
investigation O
of O
conditions O
in O
a O
British O
West O
Coast O
African O
Colony O
from O
whose O
simple O
native O
inhabitants O
another O
European O
power O
was O
known O
to O
be O
recruiting O
soldiers O
for O
its O
native O
army O
, O
which O
it O
used O
solely O
for O
the O
forcible O
collection O
of O
rubber O
and O
ivory O
from O
the O
savage O
tribes O
along O
the O
Congo O
and O
the O
Aruwimi O
. O
The O
natives O
of O
the O
British O
Colony O
complained O
that O
many O
of O
their O
young O
men O
were O
enticed O
away O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
fair O
and O
glowing O
promises O
, O
but O
that O
few O
if O
any O
ever O
returned O
to O
their O
families O
. O
The O
Englishmen O
in O
Africa O
went O
even O
further O
, O
saying O
that O
these O
poor O
blacks O
were O
held O
in O
virtual O
slavery O
, O
since O
after O
their O
terms O
of O
enlistment O
expired O
their O
ignorance O
was O
imposed O
upon O
by O
their O
white O
officers O
, O
and O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
had O
yet O
several O
years O
to O
serve O
. O
And O
so O
the O
Colonial O
Office O
appointed O
John O
Clayton O
to O
a O
new O
post O
in O
British O
West O
Africa O
, O
but O
his O
confidential O
instructions O
centered O
on O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
of O
the O
unfair O
treatment O
of O
black O
British O
subjects O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
a O
friendly O
European O
power O
. O
Why O
he O
was O
sent O
, O
is O
, O
however O
, O
of O
little O
moment O
to O
this O
story O
, O
for O
he O
never O
made O
an O
investigation O
, O
nor O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
did O
he O
ever O
reach O
his O
destination O
. O
Clayton O
was O
the O
type O
of O
Englishman O
that O
one O
likes O
best O
to O
associate O
with O
the O
noblest O
monuments O
of O
historic O
achievement O
upon O
a O
thousand O
victorious O
battlefields O
-- O
a O
strong O
, O
virile O
man O
-- O
mentally O
, O
morally O
, O
and O
physically O
. O
In O
stature O
he O
was O
above O
the O
average O
height O
; O
his O
eyes O
were O
gray O
, O
his O
features O
regular O
and O
strong O
; O
his O
carriage O
that O
of O
perfect O
, O
robust O
health O
influenced O
by O
his O
years O
of O
army O
training O
. O
Political O
ambition O
had O
caused O
him O
to O
seek O
transference O
from O
the O
army O
to O
the O
Colonial O
Office O
and O
so O
we O
find O
him O
, O
still O
young O
, O
entrusted O
with O
a O
delicate O
and O
important O
commission O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
Queen O
. O
When O
he O
received O
this O
appointment O
he O
was O
both O
elated O
and O
appalled O
. O
The O
preferment O
seemed O
to O
him O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
well-merited O
reward O
for O
painstaking O
and O
intelligent O
service O
, O
and O
as O
a O
stepping O
stone O
to O
posts O
of O
greater O
importance O
and O
responsibility O
; O
but O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
had O
been O
married O
to O
the O
Hon. O
Alice O
Rutherford O
for O
scarce O
a O
three O
months O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
thought O
of O
taking O
this O
fair O
young O
girl O
into O
the O
dangers O
and O
isolation O
of O
tropical O
Africa O
that O
appalled O
him O
. O
For O
her O
sake O
he O
would O
have O
refused O
the O
appointment O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
have O
it O
so O
. O
Instead O
she O
insisted O
that O
he O
accept O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
take O
her O
with O
him O
. O
There O
were O
mothers O
and O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
and O
aunts O
and O
cousins O
to O
express O
various O
opinions O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
as O
to O
what O
they O
severally O
advised O
history O
is O
silent O
. O
We O
know O
only O
that O
on O
a O
bright O
May O
morning O
in O
1888 O
, O
John O
, O
Lord O
Greystoke O
, O
and O
Lady O
Alice O
sailed O
from O
Dover O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Africa O
. O
A O
month O
later O
they O
arrived O
at O
Freetown O
where O
they O
chartered O
a O
small O
sailing O
vessel O
, O
the O
Fuwalda O
, O
which O
was O
to O
bear O
them O
to O
their O
final O
destination O
. O
And O
here O
John O
, O
Lord O
Greystoke O
, O
and O
Lady O
Alice O
, O
his O
wife O
, O
vanished O
from O
the O
eyes O
and O
from O
the O
knowledge O
of O
men O
. O
Two O
months O
after O
they O
weighed O
anchor O
and O
cleared O
from O
the O
port O
of O
Freetown O
a O
half O
dozen O
British O
war O
vessels O
were O
scouring O
the O
south O
Atlantic O
for O
trace O
of O
them O
or O
their O
little O
vessel O
, O
and O
it O
was O
almost O
immediately O
that O
the O
wreckage O
was O
found O
upon O
the O
shores O
of O
St. O
Helena O
which O
convinced O
the O
world O
that O
the O
Fuwalda O
had O
gone O
down O
with O
all O
on O
board O
, O
and O
hence O
the O
search O
was O
stopped O
ere O
it O
had O
scarce O
begun O
; O
though O
hope O
lingered O
in O
longing O
hearts O
for O
many O
years O
. O
The O
Fuwalda O
, O
a O
barkentine O
of O
about O
one O
hundred O
tons O
, O
was O
a O
vessel O
of O
the O
type O
often O
seen O
in O
coastwise O
trade O
in O
the O
far O
southern O
Atlantic O
, O
their O
crews O
composed O
of O
the O
offscourings O
of O
the O
sea O
-- O
unhanged O
murderers O
and O
cutthroats O
of O
every O
race O
and O
every O
nation O
. O
The O
Fuwalda O
was O
no O
exception O
to O
the O
rule O
. O
Her O
officers O
were O
swarthy O
bullies O
, O
hating O
and O
hated O
by O
their O
crew O
. O
The O
captain O
, O
while O
a O
competent O
seaman O
, O
was O
a O
brute O
in O
his O
treatment O
of O
his O
men O
. O
He O
knew O
, O
or O
at O
least O
he O
used O
, O
but O
two O
arguments O
in O
his O
dealings O
with O
them O
-- O
a O
belaying O
pin O
and O
a O
revolver O
-- O
nor O
is O
it O
likely O
that O
the O
motley O
aggregation O
he O
signed O
would O
have O
understood O
aught O
else O
. O
So O
it O
was O
that O
from O
the O
second O
day O
out O
from O
Freetown O
John O
Clayton O
and O
his O
young O
wife O
witnessed O
scenes O
upon O
the O
deck O
of O
the O
Fuwalda O
such O
as O
they O
had O
believed O
were O
never O
enacted O
outside O
the O
covers O
of O
printed O
stories O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
second O
day O
that O
the O
first O
link O
was O
forged O
in O
what O
was O
destined O
to O
form O
a O
chain O
of O
circumstances O
ending O
in O
a O
life O
for O
one O
then O
unborn O
such O
as O
has O
never O
been O
paralleled O
in O
the O
history O
of O
man O
. O
Two O
sailors O
were O
washing O
down O
the O
decks O
of O
the O
Fuwalda O
, O
the O
first O
mate O
was O
on O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
captain O
had O
stopped O
to O
speak O
with O
John O
Clayton O
and O
Lady O
Alice O
. O
The O
men O
were O
working O
backwards O
toward O
the O
little O
party O
who O
were O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
sailors O
. O
Closer O
and O
closer O
they O
came O
, O
until O
one O
of O
them O
was O
directly O
behind O
the O
captain O
. O
In O
another O
moment O
he O
would O
have O
passed O
by O
and O
this O
strange O
narrative O
would O
never O
have O
been O
recorded O
. O
But O
just O
that O
instant O
the O
officer O
turned O
to O
leave O
Lord O
and O
Lady O
Greystoke O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
tripped O
against O
the O
sailor O
and O
sprawled O
headlong O
upon O
the O
deck O
, O
overturning O
the O
water-pail O
so O
that O
he O
was O
drenched O
in O
its O
dirty O
contents O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
the O
scene O
was O
ludicrous O
; O
but O
only O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
With O
a O
volley O
of O
awful O
oaths O
, O
his O
face O
suffused O
with O
the O
scarlet O
of O
mortification O
and O
rage O
, O
the O
captain O
regained O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
terrific O
blow O
felled O
the O
sailor O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
The O
man O
was O
small O
and O
rather O
old O
, O
so O
that O
the O
brutality O
of O
the O
act O
was O
thus O
accentuated O
. O
The O
other O
seaman O
, O
however O
, O
was O
neither O
old O
nor O
small O
-- O
a O
huge O
bear O
of O
a O
man O
, O
with O
fierce O
black O
mustachios O
, O
and O
a O
great O
bull O
neck O
set O
between O
massive O
shoulders O
. O
As O
he O
saw O
his O
mate O
go O
down O
he O
crouched O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
low O
snarl O
, O
sprang O
upon O
the O
captain O
crushing O
him O
to O
his O
knees O
with O
a O
single O
mighty O
blow O
. O
From O
scarlet O
the O
officer O
's O
face O
went O
white O
, O
for O
this O
was O
mutiny O
; O
and O
mutiny O
he O
had O
met O
and O
subdued O
before O
in O
his O
brutal O
career O
. O
Without O
waiting O
to O
rise O
he O
whipped O
a O
revolver O
from O
his O
pocket O
, O
firing O
point O
blank O
at O
the O
great O
mountain O
of O
muscle O
towering O
before O
him O
; O
but O
, O
quick O
as O
he O
was O
, O
John O
Clayton O
was O
almost O
as O
quick O
, O
so O
that O
the O
bullet O
which O
was O
intended O
for O
the O
sailor O
's O
heart O
lodged O
in O
the O
sailor O
's O
leg O
instead O
, O
for O
Lord O
Greystoke O
had O
struck O
down O
the O
captain O
's O
arm O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
weapon O
flash O
in O
the O
sun O
. O
Words O
passed O
between O
Clayton O
and O
the O
captain O
, O
the O
former O
making O
it O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
disgusted O
with O
the O
brutality O
displayed O
toward O
the O
crew O
, O
nor O
would O
he O
countenance O
anything O
further O
of O
the O
kind O
while O
he O
and O
Lady O
Greystoke O
remained O
passengers O
. O
The O
captain O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
making O
an O
angry O
reply O
, O
but O
, O
thinking O
better O
of O
it O
, O
turned O
on O
his O
heel O
and O
black O
and O
scowling O
, O
strode O
aft O
. O
He O
did O
not O
care O
to O
antagonize O
an O
English O
official O
, O
for O
the O
Queen O
's O
mighty O
arm O
wielded O
a O
punitive O
instrument O
which O
he O
could O
appreciate O
, O
and O
which O
he O
feared O
-- O
England O
's O
far-reaching O
navy O
. O
The O
two O
sailors O
picked O
themselves O
up O
, O
the O
older O
man O
assisting O
his O
wounded O
comrade O
to O
rise O
. O
The O
big O
fellow O
, O
who O
was O
known O
among O
his O
mates O
as O
Black O
Michael O
, O
tried O
his O
leg O
gingerly O
, O
and O
, O
finding O
that O
it O
bore O
his O
weight O
, O
turned O
to O
Clayton O
with O
a O
word O
of O
gruff O
thanks O
. O
Though O
the O
fellow O
's O
tone O
was O
surly O
, O
his O
words O
were O
evidently O
well O
meant O
. O
Ere O
he O
had O
scarce O
finished O
his O
little O
speech O
he O
had O
turned O
and O
was O
limping O
off O
toward O
the O
forecastle O
with O
the O
very O
apparent O
intention O
of O
forestalling O
any O
further O
conversation O
. O
They O
did O
not O
see O
him O
again O
for O
several O
days O
, O
nor O
did O
the O
captain O
accord O
them O
more O
than O
the O
surliest O
of O
grunts O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
speak O
to O
them O
. O
They O
took O
their O
meals O
in O
his O
cabin O
, O
as O
they O
had O
before O
the O
unfortunate O
occurrence O
; O
but O
the O
captain O
was O
careful O
to O
see O
that O
his O
duties O
never O
permitted O
him O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
The O
other O
officers O
were O
coarse O
, O
illiterate O
fellows O
, O
but O
little O
above O
the O
villainous O
crew O
they O
bullied O
, O
and O
were O
only O
too O
glad O
to O
avoid O
social O
intercourse O
with O
the O
polished O
English O
noble O
and O
his O
lady O
, O
so O
that O
the O
Claytons O
were O
left O
very O
much O
to O
themselves O
. O
This O
in O
itself O
accorded O
perfectly O
with O
their O
desires O
, O
but O
it O
also O
rather O
isolated O
them O
from O
the O
life O
of O
the O
little O
ship O
so O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
keep O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
daily O
happenings O
which O
were O
to O
culminate O
so O
soon O
in O
bloody O
tragedy O
. O
There O
was O
in O
the O
whole O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
craft O
that O
undefinable O
something O
which O
presages O
disaster O
. O
Outwardly O
, O
to O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Claytons O
, O
all O
went O
on O
as O
before O
upon O
the O
little O
vessel O
; O
but O
that O
there O
was O
an O
undertow O
leading O
them O
toward O
some O
unknown O
danger O
both O
felt O
, O
though O
they O
did O
not O
speak O
of O
it O
to O
each O
other O
. O
On O
the O
second O
day O
after O
the O
wounding O
of O
Black O
Michael O
, O
Clayton O
came O
on O
deck O
just O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
limp O
body O
of O
one O
of O
the O
crew O
being O
carried O
below O
by O
four O
of O
his O
fellows O
while O
the O
first O
mate O
, O
a O
heavy O
belaying O
pin O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
stood O
glowering O
at O
the O
little O
party O
of O
sullen O
sailors O

, O
these O
two O

appearing O
in O

Amory O

For O
many O
years O
he O
hovered O
in O
the O
background O
of O
his O
family O

life O
, O
an O
unassertive O
figure O

a O

continually O

in O

only O
for O

wealthy O

the O
exquisite O

her O

the O

A O
brilliant O

had O

her O
youth O
passed O
in O

, O
she O
was O
versed O
in O
the O
latest O
gossip O
of O

Older O
Roman O

; O
known O
by O
name O
as O
a O
fabulously O
wealthy O
American O
girl O
to O
Cardinal O
Vitori O
and O
Queen O
Margherita O
and O
more O
subtle O
celebrities O
that O
one O
must O
have O
had O
some O
culture O
even O
to O
have O
heard O
of O
. O
She O
learned O
in O
England O
to O
prefer O
whiskey O
and O
soda O
to O
wine O
, O
and O
her O
small O
talk O
was O
broadened O
in O
two O
senses O
during O
a O
winter O
in O
Vienna O
. O
All O
in O
all O
Beatrice O
O'Hara O
absorbed O
the O
sort O
of O
education O
that O
will O
be O
quite O
impossible O
ever O
again O
; O
a O
tutelage O
measured O
by O
the O
number O
of O
things O
and O
people O
one O
could O
be O
contemptuous O
of O
and O
charming O
about O
; O
a O
culture O
rich O
in O
all O
arts O
and O
traditions O
, O
barren O
of O
all O
ideas O
, O
in O
the O
last O
of O
those O
days O
when O
the O
great O
gardener O
clipped O
the O
inferior O
roses O
to O
produce O
one O
perfect O
bud O
. O
In O
her O
less O
important O
moments O
she O
returned O
to O
America O
, O
met O
Stephen O
Blaine O
and O
married O
him O
-- O
this O
almost O
entirely O
because O
she O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
weary O
, O
a O
little O
bit O
sad O
. O
Her O
only O
child O
was O
carried O
through O
a O
tiresome O
season O
and O
brought O
into O
the O
world O
on O
a O
spring O
day O
in O
ninety-six O
. O
When O
Amory O
was O
five O
he O
was O
already O
a O
delightful O
companion O
for O
her O
. O
He O
was O
an O
auburn-haired O
boy O
, O
with O
great O
, O
handsome O
eyes O
which O
he O
would O
grow O
up O
to O
in O
time O
, O
a O
facile O
imaginative O
mind O
and O
a O
taste O
for O
fancy O
dress O
. O
From O
his O
fourth O
to O
his O
tenth O
year O
he O
did O
the O
country O
with O
his O
mother O
in O
her O
father O
's O
private O
car O
, O
from O
Coronado O
, O
where O
his O
mother O
became O
so O
bored O
that O
she O
had O
a O
nervous O
breakdown O
in O
a O
fashionable O
hotel O
, O
down O
to O
Mexico O
City O
, O
where O
she O
took O
a O
mild O
, O
almost O
epidemic O
consumption O
. O
This O
trouble O
pleased O
her O
, O
and O
later O
she O
made O
use O
of O
it O
as O
an O
intrinsic O
part O
of O
her O
atmosphere O
-- O
especially O
after O
several O
astounding O
bracers O

Dear O

do O

think O

of O

out O
of O

I O
've O
always O
suspected O

early O

life O

All O
right O

" O
" O
I O
am O
feeling O
very O
old O
to-day O

Amory O

" O
she O
would O
sigh O

her O
face O
a O
rare O
cameo O
of O
pathos O

her O
voice O
exquisitely O
modulated O

her O
hands O

My O

on O

We O
must O
leave O
this O
terrifying O
place O
to-morrow O
and O
go O
searching O
for O
sunshine O
. O
" O
Amory O
's O
penetrating O
green O
eyes O
would O
look O
out O
through O
tangled O
hair O
at O
his O
mother O
. O
Even O
at O
this O
age O
he O
had O
no O
illusions O
about O
her O
. O
" O
Amory O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
_ O
yes O
_ O

" O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
take O

red-hot O

hot O

you O
can O

" O
She O
fed O
him O
sections O
of O
the O
" O
Fetes O
Galantes O
" O
before O
he O
was O
ten O
; O
at O
eleven O
he O
could O
talk O
glibly O
, O
if O
rather O
reminiscently O
, O
of O
Brahms O
and O
Mozart O
and O
Beethoven O
. O
One O
afternoon O
, O
when O
left O
alone O
in O
the O
hotel O
at O
Hot O
Springs O
, O
he O
sampled O
his O
mother O
's O
apricot O
cordial O
, O
and O
as O
the O
taste O
pleased O
him O
, O
he O
became O
quite O
tipsy O
. O
This O
was O
fun O
for O
a O
while O
, O
but O
he O
essayed O
a O
cigarette O
in O
his O
exaltation O
, O
and O
succumbed O
to O
a O
vulgar O
, O
plebeian O
reaction O
. O
Though O
this O
incident O
horrified O
Beatrice O
, O
it O
also O
secretly O
amused O
her O
and O
became O
part O
of O
what O
in O
a O
later O
generation O
would O
have O
been O
termed O
her O
" O
line O
. O
" O
" O
This O
son O
of O
mine O
, O
" O
he O
heard O
her O
tell O
a O
room O
full O
of O
awestruck O
, O
admiring O
women O
one O
day O
, O
" O
is O
entirely O
sophisticated O
and O
quite O
charming O
-- O
but O
delicate O
-- O
we O
're O
all O
delicate O
; O
_ O
here O
_ O
, O
you O
know O
. O
" O
Her O
hand O
was O
radiantly O
outlined O
against O
her O
beautiful O
bosom O
; O
then O
sinking O
her O
voice O
to O
a O
whisper O
, O
she O
told O
them O
of O
the O
apricot O
cordial O
. O
They O
rejoiced O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a O
brave O
raconteuse O
, O
but O
many O
were O
the O
keys O
turned O
in O
sideboard O
locks O
that O
night O
against O
the O
possible O
defection O
of O
little O
Bobby O
or O
Barbara O
... O
. O
These O
domestic O
pilgrimages O
were O
invariably O
in O
state O
; O
two O
maids O
, O
the O
private O
car O
, O
or O
Mr. O
Blaine O
when O
available O
, O
and O
very O
often O
a O
physician O
. O
When O
Amory O
had O
the O
whooping-cough O
four O
disgusted O
specialists O
glared O
at O
each O
other O
hunched O
around O
his O
bed O
; O
when O
he O
took O
scarlet O
fever O
the O
number O
of O
attendants O
, O
including O
physicians O
and O
nurses O
, O
totalled O
fourteen O
. O
However O
, O
blood O
being O
thicker O
than O
broth O
, O
he O
was O
pulled O
through O
. O
The O
Blaines O
were O
attached O
to O
no O
city O
. O
They O
were O
the O
Blaines O
of O
Lake O
Geneva O
; O
they O
had O
quite O
enough O
relatives O
to O
serve O
in O
place O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
an O
enviable O
standing O
from O
Pasadena O
to O
Cape O
Cod O
. O
But O
Beatrice O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
prone O
to O
like O
only O
new O
acquaintances O
, O
as O
there O
were O
certain O
stories O
, O
such O
as O
the O
history O
of O
her O
constitution O
and O
its O
many O
amendments O
, O
memories O
of O
her O
years O
abroad O
, O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
for O
her O
to O
repeat O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O
Like O
Freudian O
dreams O
, O
they O
must O
be O
thrown O
off O
, O
else O
they O
would O
sweep O
in O
and O
lay O
siege O
to O
her O
nerves O
. O
But O
Beatrice O
was O
critical O
about O
American O
women O
, O
especially O
the O
floating O
population O
of O
ex-Westerners O
. O
" O
They O
have O
accents O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
she O
told O
Amory O
, O
" O
not O
Southern O
accents O
or O
Boston O
accents O
, O
not O
an O
accent O
attached O
to O
any O
locality O
, O
just O
an O
accent O
" O
-- O
she O
became O
dreamy O
. O
" O
They O
pick O
up O
old O
, O
moth-eaten O
London O
accents O
that O
are O
down O
on O
their O
luck O
and O
have O
to O
be O
used O
by O
some O
one O
. O
They O
talk O
as O
an O
English O
butler O
might O
after O
several O
years O
in O
a O
Chicago O
grand-opera O
company O
. O
" O
She O
became O
almost O
incoherent O
-- O
" O
Suppose O
-- O
time O
in O
every O
Western O
woman O
's O
life O
-- O
she O
feels O
her O
husband O

prosperous O
enough O

her O
to O
have O

-- O
they O
try O
to O
impress O
_ O
me O

, O
my O
dear O
-- O
" O
Though O
she O
thought O
of O
her O
body O
as O
a O
mass O
of O
frailties O
, O
she O
considered O
her O
soul O
quite O
as O
ill O
, O
and O
therefore O
important O
in O
her O
life O
. O
She O
had O
once O
been O
a O
Catholic O
, O
but O
discovering O
that O
priests O
were O
infinitely O
more O
attentive O
when O
she O
was O
in O
process O
of O
losing O
or O
regaining O
faith O
in O
Mother O
Church O
, O
she O
maintained O
an O
enchantingly O
wavering O
attitude O
. O
Often O
she O
deplored O
the O
bourgeois O
quality O
of O
the O
American O
Catholic O
clergy O
, O
and O
was O
quite O
sure O
that O
had O
she O
lived O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
great O
Continental O
cathedrals O
her O
soul O
would O
still O
be O
a O
thin O
flame O
on O
the O
mighty O
altar O
of O
Rome O
. O
Still O
, O
next O
to O
doctors O
, O
priests O
were O
her O
favorite O
sport O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Bishop O
Wiston O
, O
" O
she O
would O
declare O
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
talk O
of O
myself O
. O
I O
can O
imagine O
the O
stream O
of O
hysterical O
women O
fluttering O
at O
your O
doors O
, O
beseeching O
you O
to O
be O
simpatico O
" O
-- O
then O
after O
an O
interlude O
filled O
by O
the O
clergyman O
-- O
" O
but O
my O
mood O
-- O
is O
-- O
oddly O
dissimilar O
. O
" O
Only O
to O
bishops O
and O
above O
did O
she O
divulge O
her O
clerical O
romance O
. O
When O
she O
had O
first O
returned O
to O
her O
country O
there O
had O
been O
a O
pagan O
, O
Swinburnian O
young O
man O
in O
Asheville O
, O
for O
whose O
passionate O
kisses O
and O
unsentimental O
conversations O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
decided O
penchant O
-- O
they O
had O
discussed O
the O
matter O
pro O
and O
con O
with O
an O
intellectual O
romancing O
quite O
devoid O
of O
sappiness O
. O
Eventually O
she O
had O
decided O
to O
marry O
for O
background O
, O
and O
the O
young O
pagan O
from O
Asheville O
had O
gone O
through O
a O
spiritual O
crisis O
, O
joined O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
, O
and O
was O
now O
-- O
Monsignor O
Darcy O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Mrs. O
Blaine O
, O
he O
is O
still O
delightful O
company O

quite O
the O
cardinal O

right-hand O
man O

" O
" O
Amory O
will O
go O
to O
him O
one O
day O

I O

, O
" O
breathed O
the O
beautiful O
lady O
, O
" O
and O
Monsignor O
Darcy O
will O
understand O
him O
as O
he O
understood O
me O
. O
" O
Amory O
became O
thirteen O
, O
rather O
tall O
and O
slender O
, O
and O
more O
than O
ever O
on O
to O
his O
Celtic O
mother O
. O
He O
had O
tutored O
occasionally O
-- O
the O
idea O
being O
that O
he O
was O
to O
" O
keep O
up O
, O
" O
at O
each O
place O
" O
taking O
up O
the O
work O
where O
he O
left O
off O
, O
" O
yet O
as O
no O
tutor O
ever O
found O
the O
place O
he O
left O
off O
, O
his O
mind O
was O
still O
in O
very O
good O
shape O
. O
What O
a O
few O
more O
years O
of O
this O
life O
would O
have O
made O
of O
him O
is O
problematical O
. O
However O
, O
four O
hours O
out O
from O
land O
, O
Italy O
bound O
, O
with O
Beatrice O
, O
his O
appendix O
burst O
, O
probably O
from O
too O
many O
meals O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
after O
a O
series O
of O
frantic O
telegrams O
to O
Europe O
and O
America O
, O
to O
the O
amazement O
of O
the O
passengers O
the O
great O
ship O
slowly O
wheeled O
around O
and O
returned O
to O
New O
York O
to O
deposit O
Amory O
at O
the O
pier O
. O
You O
will O
admit O
that O
if O
it O
was O
not O
life O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O
After O
the O
operation O
Beatrice O
had O
a O
nervous O
breakdown O
that O
bore O
a O
suspicious O
resemblance O
to O
delirium O
tremens O
, O
and O
Amory O
was O
left O
in O
Minneapolis O
, O
destined O
to O
spend O
the O
ensuing O
two O
years O
with O
his O
aunt O

the O
crude O

the O

My NOM_PER
father NOM_PER
had O
a O
small O
estate O
in O
Nottinghamshire O
: O
I O
was O
the O
third O
of O
five O
sons O
. O
He O
sent O
me O
to O
Emanuel O
College O
in O
Cambridge O
at O
fourteen O
years O
old O
, O
where O
I O
resided O
three O
years O
, O
and O
applied O
myself O
close O
to O
my O
studies O
; O
but O
the O
charge O
of O
maintaining O
me O
, O
although O
I O
had O
a O
very O
scanty O
allowance O
, O
being O
too O
great O
for O
a O
narrow O
fortune O
, O
I O
was O
bound O
apprentice O
to O
Mr. O
James O
Bates O
, O
an O
eminent O
surgeon O
in O
London O
, O
with O
whom O
I O
continued O
four O
years O
. O
My O
father O
now O
and O
then O
sending O
me O
small O
sums O
of O
money O
, O
I O
laid O
them O
out O
in O
learning O
navigation O
, O
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
mathematics O
, O
useful O
to O
those O
who O
intend O
to O
travel O
, O
as O
I O
always O
believed O
it O
would O
be O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
my O
fortune O
to O
do O
. O
When O
I O
left O
Mr. O
Bates O
, O
I O
went O
down O
to O
my O
father O
: O
where O
, O
by O
the O
assistance O
of O
him O
and O
my O
uncle O
John O
, O
and O
some O
other O
relations O
, O
I O
got O
forty O
pounds O
, O
and O
a O
promise O
of O
thirty O
pounds O
a O
year O
to O
maintain O
me O
at O
Leyden O
: O
there O
I O
studied O
physic O
two O
years O
and O
seven O
months O
, O
knowing O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
in O
long O
voyages O
. O
Soon O
after O
my O
return O
from O
Leyden O
, O
I O
was O
recommended O
by O
my O
good O
master O
, O
Mr. O
Bates O
, O
to O
be O
surgeon O
to O
the O
Swallow O
, O
Captain O
Abraham O
Pannel O
, O
commander O
; O
with O
whom O
I O
continued O
three O
years O
and O
a O
half O
, O
making O
a O
voyage O
or O
two O
into O
the O
Levant O
, O
and O
some O
other O
parts O
. O
When O
I O
came O
back O
I O
resolved O
to O
settle O
in O
London O
; O
to O
which O
Mr. O
Bates O
, O
my O
master O
, O
encouraged O
me O
, O
and O
by O
him O
I O
was O
recommended O
to O
several O
patients O
. O
I O
took O
part O
of O
a O
small O
house O
in O
the O
Old O
Jewry O
; O
and O
being O
advised O
to O
alter O
my O
condition O
, O
I O
married O
Mrs. O
Mary O
Burton O
, O
second O
daughter O
to O
Mr. O
Edmund O
Burton O
, O
hosier O
, O
in O
Newgate-street O
, O
with O
whom O
I O
received O
four O
hundred O
pounds O
for O
a O
portion O
. O
But O
my O
good O
master O
Bates O
dying O
in O
two O
years O
after O
, O
and O
I O
having O
few O
friends O
, O
my O
business O
began O
to O
fail O
; O
for O
my O
conscience O
would O
not O
suffer O
me O
to O
imitate O
the O
bad O
practice O
of O
too O
many O
among O
my O
brethren O
. O
Having O
therefore O
consulted O
with O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
some O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
again O
to O
sea O
. O
I O
was O
surgeon O
successively O
in O
two O
ships O
, O
and O
made O
several O
voyages O
, O
for O
six O
years O
, O
to O
the O
East O
and O
West O
Indies O
, O
by O
which O
I O
got O
some O
addition O
to O
my O
fortune O
. O
My O
hours O
of O
leisure O
I O
spent O
in O
reading O
the O
best O
authors O
, O
ancient O
and O
modern O
, O
being O
always O
provided O
with O
a O
good O
number O
of O
books O
; O
and O
when O
I O
was O
ashore O
, O
in O
observing O
the O
manners O
and O
dispositions O
of O
the O
people O
, O
as O
well O
as O
learning O
their O
language O
; O
wherein O
I O
had O
a O
great O
facility O
, O
by O
the O
strength O
of O
my O
memory O
. O
The O
last O
of O
these O
voyages O
not O
proving O
very O
fortunate O
, O
I O
grew O
weary O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
intended O
to O
stay O
at O
home O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
family O
. O
I O
removed O
from O
the O
Old O
Jewry O
to O
Fetter O
Lane O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
to O
Wapping O
, O
hoping O
to O
get O
business O
among O
the O
sailors O
; O
but O
it O
would O
not O
turn O
to O
account O
. O
After O
three O
years O
expectation O
that O
things O
would O
mend O
, O
I O
accepted O
an O
advantageous O
offer O
from O
Captain O
William O
Prichard O
, O
master O
of O
the O
Antelope O
, O
who O
was O
making O
a O
voyage O
to O
the O
South O
Sea O
. O
We O
set O
sail O
from O
Bristol O
, O
May O
4 O
, O
1699 O
, O
and O
our O
voyage O
was O
at O
first O
very O
prosperous O
. O
It O
would O
not O
be O
proper O
, O
for O
some O
reasons O
, O
to O
trouble O
the O
reader O
with O
the O
particulars O
of O
our O
adventures O
in O
those O
seas O
; O
let O
it O
suffice O
to O
inform O
him O
, O
that O
in O
our O
passage O
from O
thence O
to O
the O
East O
Indies O
, O
we O
were O
driven O
by O
a O
violent O
storm O
to O
the O
north-west O
of O
Van O
Diemen O
’s O
Land O
. O
By O
an O
observation O
, O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
latitude O
of O
30 O
degrees O
2 O
minutes O
south O
. O
Twelve O
of O
our O
crew O
were O
dead O
by O
immoderate O
labour O
and O
ill O
food O
; O
the O
rest O
were O
in O
a O
very O
weak O
condition O
. O
On O
the O
5th O
of O
November O
, O
which O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
summer O
in O
those O
parts O
, O
the O
weather O
being O
very O
hazy O
, O
the O
seamen O
spied O
a O
rock O
within O
half O
a O
cable O
’s O
length O
of O
the O
ship O
; O
but O
the O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
, O
that O
we O
were O
driven O
directly O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
immediately O
split O
. O
Six O
of O
the O
crew O
, O
of O
whom O
I O
was O
one O
, O
having O
let O
down O
the O
boat O
into O
the O
sea O
, O
made O
a O
shift O
to O
get O
clear O
of O
the O
ship O
and O
the O
rock O
. O
We O
rowed O
, O
by O
my O
computation O
, O
about O
three O
leagues O
, O
till O
we O
were O
able O
to O
work O
no O
longer O
, O
being O
already O
spent O
with O
labour O
while O
we O
were O
in O
the O
ship O
. O
We O
therefore O
trusted O
ourselves O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
waves O
, O
and O
in O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
the O
boat O
was O
overset O
by O
a O
sudden O
flurry O
from O
the O
north O
. O
What O
became O
of O
my O
companions O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
those O
who O
escaped O
on O
the O
rock O
, O
or O
were O
left O
in O
the O
vessel O
, O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
; O
but O
conclude O
they O
were O
all O
lost O
. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
swam O
as O
fortune O
directed O
me O
, O
and O
was O
pushed O
forward O
by O
wind O
and O
tide O
. O
I O
often O
let O
my O
legs O
drop O
, O
and O
could O
feel O
no O
bottom O
; O
but O
when O
I O
was O
almost O
gone O
, O
and O
able O
to O
struggle O
no O
longer O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
within O
my O
depth O
; O
and O
by O
this O
time O
the O
storm O
was O
much O
abated O
. O
The O
declivity O
was O
so O
small O
, O
that O
I O
walked O
near O
a O
mile O
before O
I O
got O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
which O
I O
conjectured O
was O
about O
eight O
o’clock O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
I O
then O
advanced O
forward O
near O
half O
a O
mile O
, O
but O
could O
not O
discover O
any O
sign O
of O
houses O
or O
inhabitants O
; O
at O
least O
I O
was O
in O
so O
weak O
a O
condition O
, O
that O
I O
did O
not O
observe O
them O
. O
I O
was O
extremely O
tired O
, O
and O
with O
that O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
of O
the O
weather O
, O
and O
about O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
brandy O
that O
I O
drank O
as O
I O
left O
the O
ship O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
much O
inclined O
to O
sleep O
. O
I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
which O
was O
very O
short O
and O
soft O
, O
where O
I O
slept O
sounder O
than O
ever O
I O
remembered O
to O
have O
done O
in O
my O
life O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
reckoned O
, O
about O
nine O
hours O
; O
for O
when O
I O
awaked O
, O
it O
was O
just O
day-light O
. O
I O
attempted O
to O
rise O
, O
but O
was O
not O
able O
to O
stir O
: O
for O
, O
as O
I O
happened O
to O
lie O
on O
my O
back O
, O
I O
found O
my O
arms O
and O
legs O
were O
strongly O
fastened O
on O
each O
side O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
and O
my O
hair O
, O
which O
was O
long O
and O
thick O
, O
tied O
down O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
. O
I O
likewise O
felt O
several O
slender O
ligatures O
across O
my O
body O
, O
from O
my O
arm-pits O
to O
my O
thighs O
. O
I O
could O
only O
look O
upwards O
; O
the O
sun O
began O
to O
grow O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
light O
offended O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
heard O
a O
confused O
noise O
about O
me O
; O
but O
in O
the O
posture O
I O
lay O
, O
could O
see O
nothing O
except O
the O
sky O
. O
In O
a O
little O
time O
I O
felt O
something O
alive O
moving O
on O
my O
left O
leg O
, O
which O
advancing O
gently O
forward O
over O
my O
breast O
, O
came O
almost O
up O
to O
my O
chin O
; O
when O
, O
bending O
my O
eyes O
downwards O
as O
much O
as O
I O
could O
, O
I O
perceived O
it O
to O
be O
a O
human O
creature O
not O
six O
inches O
high O
, O
with O
a O
bow O
and O
arrow O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
a O
quiver O
at O
his O
back O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
I O
felt O
at O
least O
forty O
more O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
( O
as O
I O
conjectured O
) O
following O
the O
first O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
utmost O
astonishment O
, O
and O
roared O
so O
loud O
, O
that O
they O
all O
ran O
back O
in O
a O
fright O
; O
and O
some O
of O
them O
, O
as O
I O
was O
afterwards O
told O
, O
were O
hurt O
with O
the O
falls O
they O
got O
by O
leaping O
from O
my O
sides O
upon O
the O
ground O
. O
However O
, O
they O
soon O
returned O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
who O
ventured O
so O
far O
as O
to O
get O
a O
full O
sight O
of O
my O
face O
, O
lifting O
up O
his O
hands O
and O
eyes O
by O
way O
of O
admiration O
, O
cried O
out O
in O
a O
shrill O
but O
distinct O
voice O
, O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
: O
the O
others O
repeated O
the O
same O
words O
several O
times O
, O
but O
then O
I O
knew O
not O
what O
they O
meant O
. O
I O
lay O
all O
this O
while O
, O
as O
the O
reader O
may O
believe O
, O
in O
great O
uneasiness O
. O
At O
length O
, O
struggling O
to O
get O
loose O
, O
I O
had O
the O
fortune O
to O
break O
the O
strings O
, O
and O
wrench O
out O
the O
pegs O
that O
fastened O
my O
left O
arm O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
for O
, O
by O
lifting O
it O
up O
to O
my O
face O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
methods O
they O
had O
taken O
to O
bind O
me O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
a O
violent O
pull O
, O
which O
gave O
me O
excessive O
pain O
, O
I O
a O
little O
loosened O
the O
strings O
that O
tied O
down O
my O
hair O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
just O
able O
to O
turn O
my O
head O
about O
two O
inches O
. O
But O
the O
creatures O
ran O
off O
a O
second O
time O
, O
before O
I O
could O
seize O
them O
; O
whereupon O
there O
was O
a O
great O
shout O
in O
a O
very O
shrill O
accent O
, O
and O
after O
it O
ceased O
I O
heard O
one O
of O
them O
cry O
aloud O
_ O
Tolgo O
phonac O
_ O
; O
when O
in O
an O
instant O
I O
felt O
above O
a O
hundred O
arrows O
discharged O
on O
my O
left O
hand O
, O
which O
, O
pricked O
me O
like O
so O
many O
needles O
; O
and O
besides O
, O
they O
shot O
another O
flight O
into O
the O
air O
, O
as O
we O
do O
bombs O
in O
Europe O
, O
whereof O
many O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
fell O
on O
my O
body O
, O
( O
though O
I O
felt O
them O
not O
) O
, O
and O
some O
on O
my O
face O
, O
which O
I O
immediately O
covered O
with O
my O
left O
hand O
. O
When O
this O
shower O
of O
arrows O
was O
over O
, O
I O
fell O
a O
groaning O
with O
grief O
and O
pain O
; O
and O
then O
striving O
again O
to O
get O
loose O
, O
they O
discharged O
another O
volley O
larger O
than O
the O
first O
, O
and O
some O
of O
them O
attempted O
with O
spears O
to O
stick O
me O
in O
the O
sides O
; O
but O
by O
good O
luck O
I O
had O
on O
a O
buff O
jerkin O
, O
which O
they O
could O
not O
pierce O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
the O
most O
prudent O
method O
to O
lie O
still O
, O
and O
my O
design O
was O
to O
continue O
so O
till O
night O
, O
when O
, O
my O
left O
hand O
being O
already O
loose O
, O
I O
could O
easily O
free O
myself O
: O
and O
as O
for O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
I O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
I O
might O
be O
a O
match O
for O
the O
greatest O
army O
they O
could O
bring O
against O
me O
, O
if O
they O
were O
all O
of O
the O
same O
size O
with O
him O
that O
I O
saw O
. O
But O
fortune O
disposed O
otherwise O
of O
me O
. O
When O
the O
people O
observed O
I O
was O
quiet O
, O
they O
discharged O
no O
more O
arrows O
; O
but O
, O
by O
the O
noise O
I O
heard O
, O
I O
knew O
their O
numbers O
increased O
; O
and O
about O
four O
yards O
from O
me O
, O
over O
against O
my O
right O
ear O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
knocking O
for O
above O
an O
hour O
, O
like O
that O
of O
people O
at O
work O
; O
when O
turning O
my O
head O
that O
way O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
pegs O
and O
strings O
would O
permit O
me O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
stage O
erected O
about O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half O
from O
the O
ground O
, O
capable O
of O
holding O
four O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
with O
two O
or O
three O
ladders O
to O
mount O
it O
: O
from O
whence O
one O
of O
them O
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
person O
of O
quality O
, O
made O
me O
a O
long O
speech O
, O
whereof O
I O
understood O
not O
one O
syllable O
. O
But O
I O
should O
have O
mentioned O
, O
that O
before O
the O
principal O
person O
began O
his O
oration O
, O
he O
cried O
out O
three O
times O
, O
_ O
Langro O
dehul O
san O
_ O
( O
these O
words O
and O
the O
former O
were O
afterwards O
repeated O
and O
explained O
to O
me O
) O
; O
whereupon O
, O
immediately O
, O
about O
fifty O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
came O
and O
cut O
the O
strings O
that O
fastened O
the O
left O
side O
of O
my O
head O
, O
which O
gave O
me O
the O
liberty O
of O
turning O
it O
to O
the O
right O
, O
and O
of O
observing O
the O
person O
and O
gesture O
of O
him O
that O
was O
to O
speak O
. O
He O
appeared O
to O
be O
of O
a O
middle O
age O
, O
and O
taller O
than O
any O
of O
the O
other O
three O
who O
attended O
him O
, O
whereof O
one O
was O
a O
page O
that O
held O
up O
his O
train O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
somewhat O
longer O
than O
my O
middle O
finger O
; O
the O
other O
two O
stood O
one O
on O
each O
side O
to O
support O
him O
. O
He O
acted O
every O
part O
of O
an O
orator O
, O
and O
I O
could O
observe O
many O
periods O
of O
threatenings O
, O
and O
others O
of O
promises O
, O
pity O
, O
and O
kindness O
. O
I O
answered O
in O
a O
few O
words O
, O
but O
in O
the O
most O
submissive O
manner O
, O
lifting O
up O
my O
left O
hand O
, O
and O
both O
my O
eyes O
to O
the O
sun O
, O
as O
calling O
him O
for O
a O
witness O
; O
and O
being O
almost O
famished O
with O
hunger O
, O
having O
not O
eaten O
a O
morsel O
for O
some O
hours O
before O
I O
left O
the O
ship O
, O
I O
found O
the O
demands O
of O
nature O
so O
strong O
upon O
me O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
forbear O
showing O
my O
impatience O
( O
perhaps O
against O
the O
strict O
rules O
of O
decency O
) O
by O
putting O
my O
finger O
frequently O
to O
my O
mouth O
, O
to O
signify O
that O
I O
wanted O
food O
. O
The O
_ O
hurgo O
_ O
( O
for O
so O
they O
call O
a O
great O
lord O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
learnt O
) O
understood O
me O
very O
well O
. O
He O
descended O
from O
the O
stage O
, O
and O
commanded O
that O
several O
ladders O
should O
be O
applied O
to O
my O
sides O
, O
on O
which O
above O
a O
hundred O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
mounted O
and O
walked O
towards O
my O
mouth O
, O
laden O
with O
baskets O
full O
of O
meat O
, O
which O
had O
been O
provided O
and O
sent O
thither O
by O
the O
king O
’s O
orders O
, O
upon O
the O
first O
intelligence O
he O
received O
of O
me O
. O
I O
observed O
there O
was O
the O
flesh O
of O
several O
animals O
, O
but O
could O
not O
distinguish O
them O
by O
the O
taste O
. O
There O
were O
shoulders O
, O
legs O
, O
and O
loins O
, O
shaped O
like O
those O
of O
mutton O
, O
and O
very O
well O
dressed O
, O
but O
smaller O
than O
the O
wings O
of O
a O
lark O
. O
I O
ate O
them O
by O
two O
or O
three O
at O
a O
mouthful O
, O
and O
took O
three O
loaves O
at O
a O
time O
, O
about O
the O
bigness O
of O
musket O
bullets O
. O
They O
supplied O
me O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
could O
, O
showing O
a O
thousand O
marks O
of O
wonder O
and O
astonishment O
at O
my O
bulk O
and O
appetite O
. O
I O
then O
made O
another O
sign O
, O
that O
I O
wanted O
drink O
. O
They O
found O
by O
my O
eating O
that O
a O
small O
quantity O
would O
not O
suffice O
me O
; O
and O
being O
a O
most O
ingenious O
people O
, O
they O
slung O
up O
, O
with O
great O
dexterity O
, O
one O
of O
their O
largest O
hogsheads O
, O
then O
rolled O
it O
towards O
my O
hand O
, O
and O
beat O
out O
the O
top O
; O
I O
drank O
it O
off O
at O
a O
draught O
, O
which O
I O
might O
well O
do O
, O
for O
it O
did O
not O
hold O
half O
a O
pint O
, O
and O
tasted O
like O
a O
small O
wine O
of O
Burgundy O
, O
but O
much O
more O
delicious O
. O
They O
brought O
me O
a O
second O
hogshead O
, O
which O
I O
drank O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
, O
and O
made O
signs O
for O
more O
; O
but O
they O
had O
none O
to O
give O
me O
. O
When O
I O
had O
performed O
these O
wonders O
, O
they O
shouted O
for O
joy O
, O
and O
danced O
upon O
my O
breast O
, O
repeating O
several O
times O
as O
they O
did O
at O
first O
, O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
. O
They O
made O
me O
a O
sign O
that O
I O
should O
throw O
down O
the O
two O
hogsheads O
, O
but O
first O
warning O
the O
people O
below O
to O
stand O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
crying O
aloud O
, O
_ O
Borach O
mevolah O
_ O
; O
and O
when O
they O
saw O
the O
vessels O
in O
the O
air O
, O
there O
was O
a O
universal O
shout O
of O
_ O
Hekinah O
degul O
_ O
. O
I O
confess O
I O
was O
often O
tempted O
, O
while O
they O
were O
passing O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
on O
my O
body O
, O
to O
seize O
forty O
or O
fifty O
of O
the O
first O
that O
came O
in O
my O
reach O
, O
and O
dash O
them O
against O
the O
ground O
. O
But O
the O
remembrance O
of O
what O
I O
had O
felt O
, O
which O
probably O
might O
not O
be O
the O
worst O
they O
could O
do O
, O
and O
the O
promise O
of O
honour O
I O
made O
them O
— O
for O
so O
I O
interpreted O
my O
submissive O
behaviour O
— O
soon O
drove O
out O
these O
imaginations O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
now O
considered O
myself O
as O
bound O
by O
the O
laws O
of O
hospitality O
, O
to O
a O
people O
who O
had O
treated O
me O
with O
so O
much O
expense O
and O
magnificence O
. O
However O
, O
in O
my O
thoughts O
I O
could O
not O
sufficiently O
wonder O
at O
the O
intrepidity O
of O
these O
diminutive O
mortals O
, O
who O
durst O
venture O
to O
mount O
and O
walk O
upon O
my O
body O
, O
while O
one O
of O
my O
hands O
was O
at O
liberty O
, O
without O
trembling O
at O
the O
very O
sight O
of O
so O
prodigious O
a O
creature O
as O
I O
must O
appear O
to O
them O
. O
After O
some O
time O
, O
when O
they O
observed O
that O
I O
made O
no O
more O
demands O
for O
meat O
, O
there O
appeared O
before O
me O
a O
person O
of O
high O
rank O
from O
his O
imperial O
majesty O
. O
His O
excellency O
, O
having O
mounted O
on O
the O
small O
of O
my O
right O
leg O
, O
advanced O
forwards O
up O
to O
my O
face O
, O
with O
about O
a O
dozen O
of O
his O
retinue O
; O
and O
producing O
his O
credentials O
under O
the O
signet O
royal O
, O
which O
he O
applied O
close O
to O
my O
eyes O
, O
spoke O
about O
ten O
minutes O
without O
any O
signs O
of O
anger O
, O
but O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
determinate O
resolution O
, O
often O
pointing O
forwards O
, O
which O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
found O
, O
was O
towards O
the O
capital O
city O
, O
about O
half O
a O
mile O
distant O
; O
whither O
it O
was O
agreed O
by O
his O
majesty O
in O
council O
that O
I O
must O
be O
conveyed O
. O
I O
answered O
in O
few O
words O
, O
but O
to O
no O
purpose O
, O
and O
made O
a O
sign O
with O
my O
hand O
that O
was O
loose O
, O
putting O
it O
to O
the O
other O
( O
but O
over O
his O
excellency O
’s O
head O
for O
fear O
of O
hurting O
him O
or O
his O
train O
) O
and O
then O
to O
my O
own O
head O
and O
body O
, O
to O
signify O
that O
I O
desired O
my O
liberty O
. O
It O
appeared O
that O
he O
understood O
me O
well O
enough O
, O
for O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
by O
way O
of O
disapprobation O
, O
and O
held O
his O
hand O
in O
a O
posture O
to O
show O
that O
I O
must O
be O
carried O
as O
a O
prisoner O
. O
However O
, O
he O
made O
other O
signs O
to O
let O
me O
understand O
that O
I O
should O
have O
meat O
and O
drink O
enough O
, O
and O
very O
good O
treatment O
. O
Whereupon O
I O
once O
more O
thought O
of O
attempting O
to O
break O
my O
bonds O
; O
but O
again O
, O
when O
I O
felt O
the O
smart O
of O
their O
arrows O
upon O
my O
face O
and O
hands O
, O
which O
were O
all O
in O
blisters O
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
darts O
still O
sticking O
in O
them O
, O
and O
observing O
likewise O
that O
the O
number O
of O
my O
enemies O
increased O
, O
I O
gave O
tokens O
to O
let O
them O
know O
that O
they O
might O
do O
with O
me O
what O
they O
pleased O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
the O
_ O
hurgo O
_ O
and O
his O
train O
withdrew O
, O
with O
much O
civility O
and O
cheerful O
countenances O
. O
Soon O
after O
I O
heard O
a O
general O
shout O
, O
with O
frequent O
repetitions O
of O
the O
words O
_ O
Peplom O
selan O
_ O
; O
and O
I O
felt O
great O
numbers O
of O
people O
on O
my O
left O
side O
relaxing O
the O
cords O
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
turn O
upon O
my O
right O
, O
and O
to O
ease O
myself O
with O
making O
water O
; O
which O
I O
very O
plentifully O
did O
, O
to O
the O
great O
astonishment O
of O
the O
people O
; O
who O
, O
conjecturing O
by O
my O
motion O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
do O
, O
immediately O
opened O
to O
the O
right O
and O
left O
on O
that O
side O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
torrent O
, O
which O
fell O
with O
such O
noise O
and O
violence O
from O
me O
. O
But O
before O
this O
, O
they O
had O
daubed O
my O
face O
and O
both O
my O
hands O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
ointment O
, O
very O
pleasant O
to O
the O
smell O
, O
which O
, O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
removed O
all O
the O
smart O
of O
their O
arrows O
. O
These O
circumstances O
, O
added O
to O
the O
refreshment O
I O
had O
received O
by O
their O
victuals O
and O
drink O
, O
which O
were O
very O
nourishing O
, O
disposed O
me O
to O
sleep O
. O
I O
slept O
about O
eight O
hours O
, O
as O
I O
was O
afterwards O
assured O
; O
and O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
, O
for O
the O
physicians O
, O
by O
the O
emperor O
’s O
order O
, O
had O
mingled O
a O
sleepy O
potion O
in O
the O
hogsheads O
of O
wine O
. O

-- O
TO O
Mrs. PROP_PER
Saville PROP_PER
, O
England O
You PRON_PER
will O
rejoice O
to O
hear O
that O
no O
disaster O
has O
accompanied O
the O
commencement O
of O
an O
enterprise O
which O
you PRON_PER
have O
regarded O
with O
such O
evil O
forebodings O
. O
I PRON_PER
arrived O
here O
yesterday O
, O
and O
my PRON_PER
first O
task O
is O
to O
assure O
my NOM_PER
dear NOM_PER
sister NOM_PER
of O
my O
welfare O
and O
increasing O
confidence O
in O
the O
success O
of O
my O
undertaking O
. O
I O
am O
already O
far O
north O
of O
London O
, O
and O
as O
I O
walk O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Petersburgh O
, O
I O
feel O
a O
cold O
northern O
breeze O
play O
upon O
my O
cheeks O
, O
which O
braces O
my O
nerves O
and O
fills O
me O
with O
delight O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
this O
feeling O
? O
This O
breeze O
, O
which O
has O
travelled O
from O
the O
regions O
towards O
which O
I O
am O
advancing O
, O
gives O
me O
a O
foretaste O
of O
those O
icy O
climes O
. O
Inspirited O
by O
this O
wind O
of O
promise O
, O
my O
daydreams O
become O
more O
fervent O
and O
vivid O
. O
I O
try O
in O
vain O
to O
be O
persuaded O
that O
the O
pole O
is O
the O
seat O
of O
frost O
and O
desolation O
; O
it O
ever O
presents O
itself O
to O
my O
imagination O
as O
the O
region O
of O
beauty O
and O
delight O
. O
There O
, O
Margaret O
, O
the O
sun O
is O
forever O
visible O
, O
its O
broad O
disk O
just O
skirting O
the O
horizon O
and O
diffusing O
a O
perpetual O
splendour O
. O
There O
-- O
for O
with O
your O
leave O
, O
my O
sister O
, O
I O
will O
put O
some O
trust O
in O
preceding O
navigators O
-- O
there O
snow O
and O
frost O
are O
banished O
; O
and O
, O
sailing O
over O
a O
calm O
sea O
, O
we O
may O
be O
wafted O
to O
a O
land O
surpassing O
in O
wonders O
and O
in O
beauty O
every O
region O
hitherto O
discovered O
on O
the O
habitable O
globe O
. O
Its O
productions O
and O
features O
may O
be O
without O
example O
, O
as O
the O
phenomena O
of O
the O
heavenly O
bodies O
undoubtedly O
are O
in O
those O
undiscovered O
solitudes O
. O
What O
may O
not O
be O
expected O
in O
a O
country O
of O
eternal O
light O
? O
I O
may O
there O
discover O
the O
wondrous O
power O
which O
attracts O
the O
needle O
and O
may O
regulate O
a O
thousand O
celestial O
observations O
that O
require O
only O
this O
voyage O
to O
render O
their O
seeming O
eccentricities O
consistent O
forever O
. O
I O
shall O
satiate O
my O
ardent O
curiosity O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
world O
never O
before O
visited O
, O
and O
may O
tread O
a O
land O
never O
before O
imprinted O
by O
the O
foot O
of O
man O
. O
These O
are O
my O
enticements O
, O
and O
they O
are O
sufficient O
to O
conquer O
all O
fear O
of O
danger O
or O
death O
and O
to O
induce O
me O
to O
commence O
this O
laborious O
voyage O
with O
the O
joy O
a O
child O
feels O
when O
he O
embarks O
in O
a O
little O
boat O
, O
with O
his O
holiday O
mates O
, O
on O
an O
expedition O
of O
discovery O
up O
his O
native O
river O
. O
But O
supposing O
all O
these O
conjectures O
to O
be O
false O
, O
you O
can O
not O
contest O
the O
inestimable O
benefit O
which O
I O
shall O
confer O
on O
all O
mankind O
, O
to O
the O
last O
generation O
, O
by O
discovering O
a O
passage O
near O
the O
pole O
to O
those O
countries O
, O
to O
reach O
which O
at O
present O
so O
many O
months O
are O
requisite O
; O
or O
by O
ascertaining O
the O
secret O
of O
the O
magnet O
, O
which O
, O
if O
at O
all O
possible O
, O
can O
only O
be O
effected O
by O
an O
undertaking O
such O
as O
mine O
. O
These O
reflections O
have O
dispelled O
the O
agitation O
with O
which O
I O
began O
my O
letter O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
my O
heart O
glow O
with O
an O
enthusiasm O
which O
elevates O
me O
to O
heaven O
, O
for O
nothing O
contributes O
so O
much O
to O
tranquillize O
the O
mind O
as O
a O
steady O
purpose O
-- O
a O
point O
on O
which O
the O
soul O
may O
fix O
its O
intellectual O
eye O
. O
This O
expedition O
has O
been O
the O
favourite O
dream O
of O
my O
early O
years O
. O
I O
have O
read O
with O
ardour O
the O
accounts O
of O
the O
various O
voyages O
which O
have O
been O
made O
in O
the O
prospect O
of O
arriving O
at O
the O
North O
Pacific O
Ocean O
through O
the O
seas O
which O
surround O
the O
pole O
. O
You O
may O
remember O
that O
a O
history O
of O
all O
the O
voyages O
made O
for O
purposes O
of O
discovery O
composed O
the O
whole O
of O
our O
good O
Uncle O
Thomas O
' O
library O
. O
My O
education O
was O
neglected O
, O
yet O
I O
was O
passionately O
fond O
of O
reading O
. O
These O
volumes O
were O
my O
study O
day O
and O
night O
, O
and O
my O
familiarity O
with O
them O
increased O
that O
regret O
which O
I O
had O
felt O
, O
as O
a O
child O
, O
on O
learning O
that O
my O
father O
's O
dying O
injunction O
had O
forbidden O
my O
uncle O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
embark O
in O
a O
seafaring O
life O
. O
These O
visions O
faded O
when O
I O
perused O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
those O
poets O
whose O
effusions O
entranced O
my O
soul O
and O
lifted O
it O
to O
heaven O
. O
I O
also O
became O
a O
poet O
and O
for O
one O
year O
lived O
in O
a O
paradise O
of O
my O
own O
creation O
; O
I O
imagined O
that O
I O
also O
might O
obtain O
a O
niche O
in O
the O
temple O
where O
the O
names O
of O
Homer O
and O
Shakespeare O
are O
consecrated O
. O
You O
are O
well O
acquainted O
with O
my O
failure O
and O
how O
heavily O
I O
bore O
the O
disappointment O
. O
But O
just O
at O
that O
time O
I O
inherited O
the O
fortune O
of O
my O
cousin O
, O
and O
my O
thoughts O
were O
turned O
into O
the O
channel O
of O
their O
earlier O
bent O
. O
Six O
years O
have O
passed O
since O
I O
resolved O
on O
my O
present O
undertaking O
. O
I O
can O
, O
even O
now O
, O
remember O
the O
hour O
from O
which O
I O
dedicated O
myself O
to O
this O
great O
enterprise O
. O
I O
commenced O
by O
inuring O
my O
body O
to O
hardship O
. O
I O
accompanied O
the O
whale-fishers O
on O
several O
expeditions O
to O
the O
North O
Sea O
; O
I O
voluntarily O
endured O
cold O
, O
famine O
, O
thirst O
, O
and O
want O
of O
sleep O
; O
I O
often O
worked O
harder O
than O
the O
common O
sailors O
during O
the O
day O
and O
devoted O
my O
nights O
to O
the O
study O
of O
mathematics O
, O
the O
theory O
of O
medicine O
, O
and O
those O
branches O
of O
physical O
science O
from O
which O
a O
naval O
adventurer O
might O
derive O
the O
greatest O
practical O
advantage O
. O
Twice O
I O
actually O
hired O
myself O
as O
an O
under-mate O
in O
a O
Greenland O
whaler O
, O
and O
acquitted O
myself O
to O
admiration O
. O
I O
must O
own O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
proud O
when O
my O
captain O
offered O
me O
the O
second O
dignity O
in O
the O
vessel O
and O
entreated O
me O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
greatest O
earnestness O
, O
so O
valuable O
did O
he O
consider O
my O
services O
. O
And O
now O
, O
dear O
Margaret O
, O
do O
I O
not O
deserve O
to O
accomplish O
some O
great O
purpose O
? O
My O
life O
might O
have O
been O
passed O
in O
ease O
and O
luxury O
, O
but O
I O
preferred O
glory O
to O
every O
enticement O
that O
wealth O
placed O
in O
my O
path O
. O
Oh O
, O
that O
some O
encouraging O
voice O
would O
answer O
in O
the O
affirmative O
! O
My O
courage O
and O
my O
resolution O
is O
firm O
; O
but O
my O
hopes O
fluctuate O
, O
and O
my O
spirits O
are O
often O
depressed O
. O
I O
am O
about O
to O
proceed O
on O
a O
long O
and O
difficult O
voyage O
, O
the O
emergencies O
of O
which O
will O
demand O
all O
my O
fortitude O
: O
I O
am O
required O
not O
only O
to O
raise O
the O
spirits O
of O
others O
, O
but O
sometimes O
to O
sustain O
my O
own O
, O
when O
theirs O
are O
failing O
. O
This O
is O
the O
most O
favourable O
period O
for O
travelling O
in O
Russia O
. O
They O
fly O
quickly O
over O
the O
snow O
in O
their O
sledges O
; O
the O
motion O
is O
pleasant O
, O
and O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
far O
more O
agreeable O
than O
that O
of O
an O
English O
stagecoach O
. O
The O
cold O
is O
not O
excessive O
, O
if O
you O
are O
wrapped O
in O
furs O
-- O
a O
dress O
which O
I O
have O
already O
adopted O
, O
for O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference O
between O
walking O
the O
deck O
and O
remaining O
seated O
motionless O
for O
hours O
, O
when O
no O
exercise O
prevents O
the O
blood O
from O
actually O
freezing O
in O
your O
veins O
. O
I O
have O
no O
ambition O
to O
lose O
my O
life O
on O
the O
post-road O
between O
St. O
Petersburgh O
and O
Archangel O
. O
I O
shall O
depart O
for O
the O
latter O
town O
in O
a O
fortnight O
or O
three O
weeks O
; O
and O
my O
intention O
is O
to O
hire O
a O
ship O
there O
, O
which O
can O
easily O
be O
done O
by O
paying O
the O
insurance O
for O
the O
owner O
, O
and O
to O
engage O
as O
many O
sailors O
as O
I O
think O
necessary O
among O
those O
who O
are O
accustomed O
to O
the O
whale-fishing O
. O
I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
sail O
until O
the O
month O
of O
June O
; O
and O
when O
shall O
I O
return O
? O
Ah O
, O
dear O
sister O
, O
how O
can O
I O
answer O
this O
question O
? O
If O
I O
succeed O
, O
many O
, O
many O
months O
, O
perhaps O
years O
, O
will O
pass O
before O
you O
and O
I O
may O
meet O
. O
If O
I O
fail O
, O
you O
will O
see O
me O
again O
soon O
, O
or O
never O
. O
Farewell O
, O
my O
dear O
, O

-- O
To O
Mrs. O
Saville O
, O
England O
How O
slowly O
the O
time O
passes O
here O
, O
encompassed O
as O
I O
am O
by O
frost O
and O
snow O
! O
Yet O
a O
second O
step O
is O
taken O
towards O
my O
enterprise O
. O
I O
have O
hired O
a O
vessel O
and O
am O
occupied O
in O
collecting O
my O
sailors O
; O
those O
whom O
I O
have O
already O
engaged O
appear O
to O
be O
men O
on O
whom O
I O
can O
depend O
and O
are O
certainly O
possessed O
of O
dauntless O
courage O
. O
But O
I O
have O
one O
want O
which O
I O
have O
never O
yet O
been O
able O
to O
satisfy O
, O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
object O
of O
which O
I O
now O
feel O
as O
a O
most O
severe O
evil O
, O
I O
have O
no O
friend O
, O
Margaret O
: O
when O
I O
am O
glowing O
with O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
success O
, O
there O
will O
be O
none O
to O
participate O
my O
joy O
; O
if O
I O
am O
assailed O
by O
disappointment O
, O
no O
one O
will O
endeavour O
to O
sustain O
me O
in O
dejection O
. O
I O
shall O
commit O
my O
thoughts O
to O
paper O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
that O
is O
a O
poor O
medium O
for O
the O
communication O
of O
feeling O
. O
I O
desire O
the O
company O
of O
a O
man O
who O
could O
sympathize O
with O
me O
, O
whose O
eyes O
would O
reply O
to O
mine O
. O
You O
may O
deem O
me O
romantic O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
but O
I O
bitterly O
feel O
the O
want O
of O
a O
friend O
. O
I O
have O
no O
one O
near O
me O
, O
gentle O
yet O
courageous O
, O
possessed O
of O
a O
cultivated O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
capacious O
mind O
, O
whose O
tastes O
are O
like O
my O
own O
, O
to O
approve O
or O
amend O
my O
plans O
. O
How O
would O
such O
a O
friend O
repair O
the O
faults O
of O
your O
poor O
brother O
! O
I O
am O
too O
ardent O
in O
execution O
and O
too O
impatient O
of O
difficulties O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
still O
greater O
evil O
to O
me O
that O
I O
am O
self-educated O
: O
for O
the O
first O
fourteen O
years O
of O
my O
life O
I O
ran O
wild O
on O
a O
common O
and O
read O
nothing O
but O
our O
Uncle O
Thomas O
' O
books O
of O
voyages O
. O
At O
that O
age O
I O
became O
acquainted O
with O
the O
celebrated O
poets O
of O
our O
own O
country O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
when O
it O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
derive O
its O
most O
important O
benefits O
from O
such O
a O
conviction O
that O
I O
perceived O
the O
necessity O
of O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
more O
languages O
than O
that O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
twenty-eight O
and O
am O
in O
reality O
more O
illiterate O
than O
many O
schoolboys O
of O
fifteen O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
have O
thought O
more O
and O
that O
my O
daydreams O
are O
more O
extended O
and O
magnificent O
, O
but O
they O
want O
( O
as O
the O
painters O
call O
it O
) O
KEEPING O
; O
and O
I O
greatly O
need O
a O
friend O
who O
would O
have O
sense O
enough O
not O
to O
despise O
me O
as O
romantic O
, O
and O
affection O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
endeavour O
to O
regulate O
my O
mind O
. O
Well O
, O
these O
are O
useless O
complaints O
; O
I O
shall O
certainly O
find O
no O
friend O
on O
the O
wide O
ocean O
, O
nor O
even O
here O
in O
Archangel O
, O
among O
merchants O
and O
seamen O
. O
Yet O
some O
feelings O
, O
unallied O
to O
the O
dross O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
beat O
even O
in O
these O
rugged O
bosoms O
. O
My O
lieutenant O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
a O
man O
of O
wonderful O
courage O
and O
enterprise O
; O
he O
is O
madly O
desirous O
of O
glory O
, O
or O
rather O
, O
to O
word O
my O
phrase O
more O
characteristically O
, O
of O
advancement O
in O
his O
profession O
. O
He O
is O
an O
Englishman O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
national O
and O
professional O
prejudices O
, O
unsoftened O
by O
cultivation O
, O
retains O
some O
of O
the O
noblest O
endowments O
of O
humanity O
. O
I O
first O
became O
acquainted O
with O
him O
on O
board O
a O
whale O
vessel O
; O
finding O
that O
he O
was O
unemployed O
in O
this O
city O
, O
I O
easily O
engaged O
him O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
enterprise O
. O
The O
master O
is O
a O
person O
of O
an O
excellent O
disposition O
and O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the O
ship O
for O
his O
gentleness O
and O
the O
mildness O
of O
his O
discipline O
. O
This O
circumstance O
, O
added O
to O
his O
well-known O
integrity O
and O
dauntless O
courage O
, O
made O
me O
very O
desirous O
to O
engage O
him O
. O
A O
youth O
passed O
in O
solitude O
, O
my O
best O
years O
spent O
under O
your O
gentle O
and O
feminine O
fosterage O
, O
has O
so O
refined O
the O
groundwork O
of O
my O
character O
that O
I O
can O
not O
overcome O
an O
intense O
distaste O
to O
the O
usual O
brutality O
exercised O
on O
board O
ship O
: O
I O
have O
never O
believed O
it O
to O
be O
necessary O
, O
and O
when O
I O
heard O
of O
a O
mariner O
equally O
noted O
for O
his O
kindliness O
of O
heart O
and O
the O
respect O
and O
obedience O
paid O
to O
him O
by O
his O
crew O
, O
I O
felt O
myself O
peculiarly O
fortunate O
in O
being O
able O
to O
secure O
his O
services O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
him O
first O
in O
rather O
a O
romantic O
manner O
, O
from O
a O
lady O
who O
owes O
to O
him O
the O
happiness O
of O
her O
life O
. O
This O
, O
briefly O
, O
is O
his O
story O
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
he O
loved O
a O
young O
Russian O
lady O
of O
moderate O
fortune O
, O
and O
having O
amassed O
a O
considerable O
sum O
in O
prize-money O
, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
girl O
consented O
to O
the O
match O
. O
He O
saw O
his O
mistress O
once O
before O
the O
destined O
ceremony O
; O
but O
she O
was O
bathed O
in O
tears O
, O
and O
throwing O
herself O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
entreated O
him O
to O
spare O
her O
, O
confessing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
loved O
another O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
poor O
, O
and O
that O
her O
father O
would O
never O
consent O
to O
the O
union O
. O
My O
generous O
friend O
reassured O
the O
suppliant O
, O
and O
on O
being O
informed O
of O
the O
name O
of O
her O
lover O
, O
instantly O
abandoned O
his O
pursuit O
. O
He O
had O
already O
bought O
a O
farm O
with O
his O
money O
, O
on O
which O
he O
had O
designed O
to O
pass O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
; O
but O
he O
bestowed O
the O
whole O
on O
his O
rival O
, O
together O
with O
the O
remains O
of O
his O
prize-money O
to O
purchase O
stock O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
solicited O
the O
young O
woman O
's O
father O
to O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
with O
her O
lover O
. O
But O
the O
old O
man O
decidedly O
refused O
, O
thinking O
himself O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
my O
friend O
, O
who O
, O
when O
he O
found O
the O
father O
inexorable O
, O
quitted O
his O
country O
, O
nor O
returned O
until O
he O
heard O
that O
his O
former O
mistress O
was O
married O
according O
to O
her O
inclinations O
. O
" O
What O
a O
noble O
fellow O
! O
" O
you O
will O
exclaim O
. O
He O
is O
so O
; O
but O
then O
he O
is O
wholly O
uneducated O
: O
he O
is O
as O
silent O
as O
a O
Turk O
, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
ignorant O
carelessness O
attends O
him O
, O
which O
, O
while O
it O
renders O
his O
conduct O
the O
more O
astonishing O
, O
detracts O
from O
the O
interest O
and O
sympathy O
which O
otherwise O
he O
would O
command O
. O

A O
cloudy O
day O
: O
do O
you PRON_PER
know O
what O
that O
is O
in O
a O
town O
of O
iron-works O
? O
The O
sky O
sank O
down O
before O
dawn O
, O
muddy O
, O
flat O
, O
immovable O
. O
The O
air O
is O
thick O
, O
clammy O
with O
the O
breath O
of O
crowded NOM_PER
human NOM_PER
beings NOM_PER
. O
It O
stifles O
me PRON_PER
. O
I PRON_PER
open O
the O
window O
, O
and O
, O
looking O
out O
, O
can O
scarcely O
see O
through O
the O
rain O
the NOM_PER
grocer NOM_PER
's O
shop O
opposite O
, O
where O
a NOM_PER
crowd NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
drunken NOM_PER
Irishmen NOM_PER
are O
puffing O
Lynchburg O
tobacco O
in O
their O
pipes O
. O
I O
can O
detect O
the O
scent O
through O
all O
the O
foul O
smells O
ranging O
loose O
in O
the O
air O
. O
The O
idiosyncrasy O
of O
this O
town O
is O
smoke O
. O
It O
rolls O
sullenly O
in O
slow O
folds O
from O
the O
great O
chimneys O
of O
the O
iron-foundries O
, O
and O
settles O
down O
in O
black O
, O
slimy O
pools O
on O
the O
muddy O
streets O
. O
Smoke O
on O
the O
wharves O
, O
smoke O
on O
the O
dingy O
boats O
, O
on O
the O
yellow O
river O
, O
-- O
clinging O
in O
a O
coating O
of O
greasy O
soot O
to O
the O
house-front O
, O
the O
two O
faded O
poplars O
, O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
passers-by O
. O
The O
long O
train O
of O
mules O
, O
dragging O
masses O
of O
pig-iron O
through O
the O
narrow O
street O
, O
have O
a O
foul O
vapor O
hanging O
to O
their O
reeking O
sides O
. O
Here O
, O
inside O
, O
is O
a O
little O
broken O
figure O
of O
an O
angel O
pointing O
upward O
from O
the O
mantel-shelf O
; O
but O
even O
its O
wings O
are O
covered O
with O
smoke O
, O
clotted O
and O
black O
. O
Smoke O
everywhere O
! O
A O
dirty O
canary O
chirps O
desolately O
in O
a O
cage O
beside O
me O
. O
Its O
dream O
of O
green O
fields O
and O
sunshine O
is O
a O
very O
old O
dream O
, O
-- O
almost O
worn O
out O
, O
I O
think O
. O
From O
the O
back-window O
I O
can O
see O
a O
narrow O
brick-yard O
sloping O
down O
to O
the O
river-side O
, O
strewed O
with O
rain-butts O
and O
tubs O
. O
The O
river O
, O
dull O
and O
tawny-colored O
, O
( O
la O
belle O
riviere O
! O
) O
drags O
itself O
sluggishly O
along O
, O
tired O
of O
the O
heavy O
weight O
of O
boats O
and O
coal-barges O
. O
What O
wonder O
? O
When O
I O
was O
a O
child O
, O
I O
used O
to O
fancy O
a O
look O
of O
weary O
, O
dumb O
appeal O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
the O
negro-like O
river O
slavishly O
bearing O
its O
burden O
day O
after O
day O
. O
Something O
of O
the O
same O
idle O
notion O
comes O
to O
me O
to-day O
, O
when O
from O
the O
street-window O
I O
look O
on O
the O
slow O
stream O
of O
human O
life O
creeping O
past O
, O
night O
and O
morning O
, O
to O
the O
great O
mills O
. O
Masses O
of O
men O
, O
with O
dull O
, O
besotted O
faces O
bent O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
sharpened O
here O
and O
there O
by O
pain O
or O
cunning O
; O
skin O
and O
muscle O
and O
flesh O
begrimed O
with O
smoke O
and O
ashes O
; O
stooping O
all O
night O
over O
boiling O
caldrons O
of O
metal O
, O
laired O
by O
day O
in O
dens O
of O
drunkenness O
and O
infamy O
; O
breathing O
from O
infancy O
to O
death O
an O
air O
saturated O
with O
fog O
and O
grease O
and O
soot O
, O
vileness O
for O
soul O
and O
body O
. O
What O
do O
you O
make O
of O
a O
case O
like O
that O
, O
amateur O
psychologist O
? O
You O
call O
it O
an O
altogether O
serious O
thing O
to O
be O
alive O
: O
to O
these O
men O
it O
is O
a O
drunken O
jest O
, O
a O
joke O
, O
-- O
horrible O
to O
angels O
perhaps O
, O
to O
them O
commonplace O
enough O
. O
My O
fancy O
about O
the O
river O
was O
an O
idle O
one O
: O
it O
is O
no O
type O
of O
such O
a O
life O
. O
What O
if O
it O
be O
stagnant O
and O
slimy O
here O
? O
It O
knows O
that O
beyond O
there O
waits O
for O
it O
odorous O
sunlight O
, O
quaint O
old O
gardens O
, O
dusky O
with O
soft O
, O
green O
foliage O
of O
apple-trees O
, O
and O
flushing O
crimson O
with O
roses O
, O
-- O
air O
, O
and O
fields O
, O
and O
mountains O
. O
The O
future O
of O
the O
Welsh O
puddler O
passing O
just O
now O
is O
not O
so O
pleasant O
. O
To O
be O
stowed O
away O
, O
after O
his O
grimy O
work O
is O
done O
, O
in O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
muddy O
graveyard O
, O
and O
after O
that O
, O
not O
air O
, O
nor O
green O
fields O
, O
nor O
curious O
roses O
. O
Can O
you O
see O
how O
foggy O
the O
day O
is O
? O
As O
I O
stand O
here O
, O
idly O
tapping O
the O
windowpane O
, O
and O
looking O
out O
through O
the O
rain O
at O
the O
dirty O
back-yard O
and O
the O
coalboats O
below O
, O
fragments O
of O
an O
old O
story O
float O
up O
before O
me O
, O
-- O
a O
story O
of O
this O
house O
into O
which O
I O
happened O
to O
come O
to-day O
. O
You O
may O
think O
it O
a O
tiresome O
story O
enough O
, O
as O
foggy O
as O
the O
day O
, O
sharpened O
by O
no O
sudden O
flashes O
of O
pain O
or O
pleasure O
. O
-- O
I O
know O
: O
only O
the O
outline O
of O
a O
dull O
life O
, O
that O
long O
since O
, O
with O
thousands O
of O
dull O
lives O
like O
its O
own O
, O
was O
vainly O
lived O
and O
lost O
: O
thousands O
of O
them O
, O
massed O
, O
vile O
, O
slimy O
lives O
, O
like O
those O
of O
the O
torpid O
lizards O
in O
yonder O
stagnant O
water-butt O
. O
-- O
Lost O
? O
There O
is O
a O
curious O
point O
for O
you O
to O
settle O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
who O
study O
psychology O
in O
a O
lazy O
, O
dilettante O
way O
. O
Stop O
a O
moment O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
be O
honest O
. O
This O
is O
what O
I O
want O
you O
to O
do O
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
hide O
your O
disgust O
, O
take O
no O
heed O
to O
your O
clean O
clothes O
, O
and O
come O
right O
down O
with O
me O
, O
-- O
here O
, O
into O
the O
thickest O
of O
the O
fog O
and O
mud O
and O
foul O
effluvia O
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
hear O
this O
story O
. O
There O
is O
a O
secret O
down O
here O
, O
in O
this O
nightmare O
fog O
, O
that O
has O
lain O
dumb O
for O
centuries O
: O
I O
want O
to O
make O
it O
a O
real O
thing O
to O
you O
. O
You O
, O
Egoist O
, O
or O
Pantheist O
, O
or O
Arminian O
, O
busy O
in O
making O
straight O
paths O
for O
your O
feet O
on O
the O
hills O
, O
do O
not O
see O
it O
clearly O
, O
-- O
this O
terrible O
question O
which O
men O
here O
have O
gone O
mad O
and O
died O
trying O
to O
answer O
. O
I O
dare O
not O
put O
this O
secret O
into O
words O
. O
I O
told O
you O
it O
was O
dumb O
. O
These O
men O
, O
going O
by O
with O
drunken O
faces O
and O
brains O
full O
of O
unawakened O
power O
, O
do O
not O
ask O
it O
of O
Society O
or O
of O
God O
. O
Their O
lives O
ask O
it O
; O
their O
deaths O
ask O
it O
. O
There O
is O
no O
reply O
. O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
plainly O
that O
I O
have O
a O
great O
hope O
; O
and O
I O
bring O
it O
to O
you O
to O
be O
tested O
. O
It O
is O
this O
: O
that O
this O
terrible O
dumb O
question O
is O
its O
own O
reply O
; O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
sentence O
of O
death O
we O
think O
it O
, O
but O
, O
from O
the O
very O
extremity O
of O
its O
darkness O
, O
the O
most O
solemn O
prophecy O
which O
the O
world O
has O
known O
of O
the O
Hope O
to O
come O
. O
I O
dare O
make O
my O
meaning O
no O
clearer O
, O
but O
will O
only O
tell O
my O
story O
. O
It O
will O
, O
perhaps O
, O
seem O
to O
you O
as O
foul O
and O
dark O
as O
this O
thick O
vapor O
about O
us O
, O
and O
as O
pregnant O
with O
death O
; O
but O
if O
your O
eyes O
are O
free O
as O
mine O
are O
to O
look O
deeper O
, O
no O
perfume-tinted O
dawn O
will O
be O
so O
fair O
with O
promise O
of O
the O
day O
that O
shall O
surely O
come O
. O
My O
story O
is O
very O
simple O
, O
-- O
Only O
what O
I O
remember O
of O
the O
life O
of O
one O
of O
these O
men O
, O
-- O
a O
furnace-tender O
in O
one O
of O
Kirby O
& O
John O
's O
rolling-mills O
, O
-- O
Hugh O
Wolfe O
. O
You O
know O
the O
mills O
? O
They O
took O
the O
great O
order O
for O
the O
lower O
Virginia O
railroads O
there O
last O
winter O
; O
run O
usually O
with O
about O
a O
thousand O
men O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
why O
I O
choose O
the O
half-forgotten O
story O
of O
this O
Wolfe O
more O
than O
that O
of O
myriads O
of O
these O
furnace-hands O
. O
Perhaps O
because O
there O
is O
a O
secret O
, O
underlying O
sympathy O
between O
that O
story O
and O
this O
day O
with O
its O
impure O
fog O
and O
thwarted O
sunshine O
, O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
simply O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
this O
house O
is O
the O
one O
where O
the O
Wolfes O
lived O
. O
There O
were O
the O
father O
and O
son O
, O
-- O
both O
hands O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
in O
one O
of O
Kirby O
& O
John O
's O
mills O
for O
making O
railroad-iron O
, O
-- O
and O
Deborah O
, O
their O
cousin O
, O
a O
picker O
in O
some O
of O
the O
cotton-mills O
. O
The O
house O
was O
rented O
then O
to O
half O
a O
dozen O
families O
. O
The O
Wolfes O
had O
two O
of O
the O
cellar-rooms O
. O
The O
old O
man O
, O
like O
many O
of O
the O
puddlers O
and O
feeders O
of O
the O
mills O
, O
was O
Welsh O
, O
-- O
had O
spent O
half O
of O
his O
life O
in O
the O
Cornish O
tin-mines O
. O
You O
may O
pick O
the O
Welsh O
emigrants O
, O
Cornish O
miners O
, O
out O
of O
the O
throng O
passing O
the O
windows O
, O
any O
day O
. O
They O
are O
a O
trifle O
more O
filthy O
; O
their O
muscles O
are O
not O
so O
brawny O
; O
they O
stoop O
more O
. O
When O
they O
are O
drunk O
, O
they O
neither O
yell O
, O
nor O
shout O
, O
nor O
stagger O
, O
but O
skulk O
along O
like O
beaten O
hounds O
. O
A O
pure O
, O
unmixed O
blood O
, O
I O
fancy O
: O
shows O
itself O
in O
the O
slight O
angular O
bodies O
and O
sharply-cut O
facial O
lines O
. O
It O
is O
nearly O
thirty O
years O
since O
the O
Wolfes O
lived O
here O
. O
Their O
lives O
were O
like O
those O
of O
their O
class O
: O
incessant O
labor O
, O
sleeping O
in O
kennel-like O
rooms O
, O
eating O
rank O
pork O
and O
molasses O
, O
drinking O
-- O
God O
and O
the O
distillers O
only O
know O
what O
; O
with O
an O
occasional O
night O
in O
jail O
, O
to O
atone O
for O
some O
drunken O
excess O
. O
Is O
that O
all O
of O
their O
lives O
? O
-- O
of O
the O
portion O
given O
to O
them O
and O
these O
their O
duplicates O
swarming O
the O
streets O
to-day O
? O
-- O
nothing O
beneath O
? O
-- O
all O
? O
So O
many O
a O
political O
reformer O
will O
tell O
you O
, O
-- O
and O
many O
a O
private O
reformer O
, O
too O
, O
who O
has O
gone O
among O
them O
with O
a O
heart O
tender O
with O
Christ O
's O
charity O
, O
and O
come O
out O
outraged O
, O
hardened O
. O
One O
rainy O
night O
, O
about O
eleven O
o'clock O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
half-clothed O
women O
stopped O
outside O
of O
the O
cellar-door O
. O
They O
were O
going O
home O
from O
the O
cotton-mill O
. O
" O
Good-night O
, O
Deb O
, O
" O
said O
one O
, O
a O
mulatto O
, O
steadying O
herself O
against O
the O
gas-post O
. O
She O
needed O
the O
post O
to O
steady O
her O
. O
So O
did O
more O
than O
one O
of O
them O
. O
" O

said O
a O
shrill O
Welsh O
voice O
in O
the O
crowd O
. O
Two O
or O
three O
dirty O
hands O
were O
thrust O
out O
to O
catch O
the O
gown O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
who O
was O

" O
They O
went O
on O
, O
the O
mulatto O
inclining O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
show O
fight O
, O
and O
drag O
the O
woman O
Wolfe O
off O
with O
them O
; O
but O
, O
being O
pacified O
, O
she O
staggered O
away O
. O
Deborah O
groped O
her O
way O
into O
the O
cellar O
, O
and O
, O
after O
considerable O
stumbling O
, O
kindled O
a O
match O
, O
and O
lighted O
a O
tallow O
dip O
, O
that O
sent O
a O
yellow O
glimmer O
over O
the O
room O
. O
It O
was O
low O
, O
damp O
, O
-- O
the O
earthen O
floor O
covered O
with O
a O
green O
, O
slimy O
moss O
, O
-- O
a O
fetid O
air O
smothering O
the O
breath O
. O
Old O
Wolfe O
lay O
asleep O
on O
a O
heap O
of O
straw O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
torn O
horse-blanket O
. O
He O
was O
a O
pale O
, O
meek O
little O
man O
, O
with O
a O
white O
face O
and O
red O
rabbit-eyes O
. O
The O
woman O
Deborah O
was O
like O
him O
; O
only O
her O
face O
was O
even O
more O
ghastly O
, O
her O
lips O
bluer O
, O
her O
eyes O
more O
watery O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
faded O
cotton O
gown O
and O
a O
slouching O
bonnet O
. O
When O
she O
walked O
, O
one O
could O
see O
that O
she O
was O
deformed O
, O
almost O
a O
hunchback O
. O
She O
trod O
softly O
, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
waken O
him O
, O
and O
went O
through O
into O
the O
room O
beyond O
. O
There O
she O
found O
by O
the O
half-extinguished O
fire O
an O
iron O
saucepan O
filled O
with O
cold O
boiled O
potatoes O
, O
which O
she O
put O
upon O
a O
broken O
chair O
with O
a O
pint-cup O
of O
ale O
. O
Placing O
the O
old O
candlestick O
beside O
this O
dainty O
repast O
, O
she O
untied O
her O
bonnet O
, O
which O
hung O
limp O
and O
wet O
over O
her O
face O
, O
and O
prepared O
to O
eat O
her O
supper O
. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
food O
that O
had O
touched O
her O
lips O
since O
morning O
. O
There O
was O
enough O
of O
it O
, O
however O
: O
there O
is O
not O
always O
. O
She O
was O
hungry O
, O
-- O
one O
could O
see O
that O
easily O
enough O
, O
-- O
and O
not O
drunk O
, O
as O
most O
of O
her O
companions O
would O
have O
been O
found O
at O
this O
hour O
. O
She O
did O
not O
drink O
, O
this O
woman O
, O
-- O
her O
face O
told O
that O
, O
too O
, O
-- O
nothing O
stronger O
than O
ale O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
weak O
, O
flaccid O
wretch O
had O
some O
stimulant O
in O
her O
pale O
life O
to O
keep O
her O
up O
, O
-- O
some O
love O
or O
hope O
, O
it O
might O
be O
, O
or O
urgent O
need O
. O
When O
that O
stimulant O
was O
gone O
, O
she O
would O
take O
to O
whiskey O
. O
Man O
can O
not O
live O
by O
work O
alone O
. O
While O
she O
was O
skinning O
the O
potatoes O
, O
and O
munching O
them O
, O
a O
noise O
behind O
her O
made O
her O
stop O

Magnificent PROP_PER

may O
now O
perceive O
, O
if O

has O
happened O
to O

New O

in O
1916 O
; O
and O
the PROP_PER
Ambersons PROP_PER
were O
magnificent O
in O
their PRON_PER
day O
and O
place O
. O
Their PRON_PER
splendour O
lasted O
throughout O
all O
the O
years O
that O
saw O
their PRON_PER
Midland O
town O
spread O
and O
darken O
into O
a O
city O
, O
but O
reached O
its O
topmost O
during O
the O
period O
when O
every NOM_PER
prosperous NOM_PER
family NOM_PER
with NOM_PER
children NOM_PER
kept O
a O
Newfoundland O
dog O
. O
In O
that O
town O
, O
in O
those O
days O
, O
all O
the O
women O
who O
wore O
silk O
or O
velvet O
knew O
all O
the O
other O
women O
who O
wore O
silk O
or O
velvet O
, O
and O
when O
there O
was O
a O
new O
purchase O
of O
sealskin O
, O
sick O
people O
were O
got O
to O
windows O
to O
see O
it O
go O
by O
. O
Trotters O
were O
out O
, O
in O
the O
winter O
afternoons O
, O
racing O
light O
sleighs O
on O
National O
Avenue O
and O
Tennessee O
Street O
; O
everybody O
recognized O
both O
the O
trotters O
and O
the O
drivers O
; O
and O
again O
knew O
them O
as O
well O
on O
summer O
evenings O
, O
when O
slim O
buggies O
whizzed O
by O
in O
renewals O
of O
the O
snow-time O
rivalry O
. O
For O
that O
matter O
, O
everybody O
knew O
everybody O
else O
's O
family O
horse-and-carriage O
, O
could O
identify O
such O
a O
silhouette O
half O
a O
mile O
down O
the O
street O
, O
and O
thereby O
was O
sure O
who O
was O
going O
to O
market O
, O
or O
to O
a O
reception O
, O
or O
coming O
home O
from O
office O
or O
store O
to O
noon O
dinner O
or O
evening O
supper O
. O
During O
the O
earlier O
years O
of O
this O
period O
, O
elegance O
of O
personal O
appearance O
was O
believed O
to O
rest O
more O
upon O
the O
texture O
of O
garments O
than O
upon O
their O
shaping O
. O
A O
silk O
dress O
needed O
no O
remodelling O
when O
it O
was O
a O
year O
or O
so O
old O
; O
it O
remained O
distinguished O
by O
merely O
remaining O
silk O
. O
Old O
men O
and O
governors O
wore O
broadcloth O
; O
" O
full O
dress O
" O
was O
broadcloth O
with O
" O
doeskin O
" O
trousers O
; O
and O
there O
were O
seen O
men O
of O
all O
ages O
to O
whom O
a O
hat O
meant O
only O
that O
rigid O
, O
tall O
silk O
thing O
known O
to O
impudence O
as O
a O
" O
stove-pipe O
. O
" O
In O
town O
and O
country O
these O
men O
would O
wear O
no O
other O
hat O
, O
and O
, O
without O
self-consciousness O
, O
they O
went O
rowing O
in O
such O
hats O
. O
Shifting O
fashions O
of O
shape O
replaced O
aristocracy O
of O
texture O
: O
dressmakers O
, O
shoemakers O
, O
hatmakers O
, O
and O
tailors O
, O
increasing O
in O
cunning O
and O
in O
power O
, O
found O
means O
to O
make O
new O
clothes O
old O
. O
The O
long O
contagion O
of O
the O
" O
Derby O
" O
hat O
arrived O
: O
one O
season O
the O
crown O
of O
this O
hat O
would O
be O
a O
bucket O
; O
the O
next O
it O
would O
be O
a O
spoon O
. O
Every O
house O
still O
kept O
its O
bootjack O
, O
but O
high-topped O
boots O
gave O
way O
to O
shoes O
and O
" O
congress O
gaiters O
" O
; O
and O
these O
were O
played O
through O
fashions O
that O
shaped O
them O
now O
with O
toes O
like O
box-ends O
and O
now O
with O
toes O
like O
the O
prows O
of O
racing O
shells O
. O
Trousers O
with O
a O
crease O
were O
considered O
plebeian O
; O
the O
crease O
proved O
that O
the O
garment O
had O
lain O
upon O
a O
shelf O
, O
and O
hence O
was O
" O
ready-made O
" O
; O
these O
betraying O
trousers O
were O
called O
" O
hand-me-downs O
, O
" O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
shelf O
. O
In O
the O
early O
' O
eighties O
, O
while O
bangs O
and O
bustles O
were O
having O
their O
way O
with O
women O
, O
that O
variation O
of O
dandy O
known O
as O
the O
" O
dude O
" O
was O
invented O
: O
he O
wore O
trousers O
as O
tight O
as O
stockings O
, O
dagger-pointed O
shoes O
, O
a O
spoon O
" O
Derby O
, O
" O
a O
single-breasted O
coat O
called O
a O
" O
Chesterfield O
, O
" O
with O
short O
flaring O
skirts O
, O
a O
torturing O
cylindrical O
collar O
, O
laundered O
to O
a O
polish O
and O
three O
inches O
high O
, O
while O
his O
other O
neckgear O
might O
be O
a O
heavy O
, O
puffed O
cravat O
or O
a O
tiny O
bow O
fit O
for O
a O
doll O
's O
braids O
. O
With O
evening O
dress O
he O
wore O
a O
tan O
overcoat O
so O
short O
that O
his O
black O
coat-tails O
hung O
visible O
, O
five O
inches O
below O
the O
over-coat O
; O
but O
after O
a O
season O
or O
two O
he O
lengthened O
his O
overcoat O
till O
it O
touched O
his O
heels O
, O
and O
he O
passed O
out O
of O
his O
tight O
trousers O
into O
trousers O
like O
great O
bags O
. O
Then O
, O
presently O
, O
he O
was O
seen O
no O
more O
, O
though O
the O
word O
that O
had O
been O
coined O
for O
him O
remained O
in O
the O
vocabularies O
of O
the O
impertinent O
. O
It O
was O
a O
hairier O
day O
than O
this O
. O
Beards O
were O
to O
the O
wearers O
' O
fancy O
, O
and O
things O
as O
strange O
as O
the O
Kaiserliche O
boar-tusk O
moustache O
were O
commonplace O
. O
" O
Side-burns O
" O
found O
nourishment O
upon O
childlike O
profiles O
; O
great O
Dundreary O
whiskers O
blew O
like O
tippets O
over O
young O
shoulders O
; O
moustaches O
were O
trained O
as O
lambrequins O
over O
forgotten O
mouths O
; O
and O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
a O
Senator O
of O
the O
United O
States O
to O
wear O
a O
mist O
of O
white O
whisker O
upon O
his O
throat O
only O
, O
not O
a O
newspaper O
in O
the O
land O
finding O
the O
ornament O
distinguished O
enough O
to O
warrant O
a O
lampoon O
. O
Surely O
no O
more O
is O
needed O
to O
prove O
that O
so O
short O
a O
time O
ago O
we O
were O
living O
in O
another O
age O
! O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
Ambersons O
' O
great O
period O
most O
of O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
Midland O
town O
were O
of O
a O
pleasant O
architecture O
. O
They O
lacked O
style O
, O
but O
also O
lacked O
pretentiousness O
, O
and O
whatever O
does O
not O
pretend O
at O
all O
has O
style O
enough O
. O
They O
stood O
in O
commodious O
yards O
, O
well O
shaded O
by O
leftover O
forest O
trees O
, O
elm O
and O
walnut O
and O
beech O
, O
with O
here O
and O
there O
a O
line O
of O
tall O
sycamores O
where O
the O
land O
had O
been O
made O
by O
filling O
bayous O
from O
the O
creek O
. O
The O
house O
of O
a O
" O
prominent O
resident O
, O
" O
facing O
Military O
Square O
, O
or O
National O
Avenue O
, O
or O
Tennessee O
Street O
, O
was O
built O
of O
brick O
upon O
a O
stone O
foundation O
, O
or O
of O
wood O
upon O
a O
brick O
foundation O
. O
Usually O
it O
had O
a O
" O
front O
porch O
" O
and O
a O
" O
back O
porch O
" O
; O
often O
a O
" O
side O
porch O
, O
" O
too O
. O
There O
was O
a O
" O
front O
hall O
" O
; O
there O
was O
a O
" O
side O
hall O
" O
; O
and O
sometimes O
a O
" O
back O
hall O
. O
" O
From O
the O
" O
front O
hall O
" O
opened O
three O
rooms O
, O
the O
" O
parlour O
, O
" O
the O
" O
sitting O
room O
, O
" O
and O
the O
" O
library O
" O
; O
and O
the O
library O
could O
show O
warrant O
to O
its O
title O
-- O
for O
some O
reason O
these O
people O
bought O
books O
. O
Commonly O
, O
the O
family O
sat O
more O
in O
the O
library O
than O
in O
the O
" O
sitting O
room O
, O
" O
while O
callers O
, O
when O
they O
came O
formally O
, O
were O
kept O
to O
the O
" O
parlour O
, O
" O
a O
place O
of O
formidable O
polish O
and O
discomfort O
. O
The O
upholstery O
of O
the O
library O
furniture O
was O
a O
little O
shabby O
; O
but O
the O
hostile O
chairs O
and O
sofa O
of O
the O
" O
parlour O
" O
always O
looked O
new O
. O
For O
all O
the O
wear O
and O
tear O
they O
got O
they O
should O
have O
lasted O
a O
thousand O
years O
. O
Upstairs O
were O
the O
bedrooms O
; O
" O
mother-and-father O
's O
room O
" O
the O
largest O
; O
a O
smaller O
room O
for O
one O
or O
two O
sons O
another O
for O
one O
or O
two O
daughters O
; O
each O
of O
these O
rooms O
containing O
a O
double O
bed O
, O
a O
" O
washstand O
, O
" O
a O
" O
bureau O
, O
" O
a O
wardrobe O
, O
a O
little O
table O
, O
a O
rocking-chair O
, O
and O
often O
a O
chair O
or O
two O
that O
had O
been O
slightly O
damaged O
downstairs O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
justify O
either O
the O
expense O
of O
repair O
or O
decisive O
abandonment O
in O
the O
attic O
. O
And O
there O
was O
always O
a O
" O
spare-room O
, O
" O
for O
visitors O
( O
where O
the O
sewing-machine O
usually O
was O
kept O
) O
, O
and O
during O
the O
' O
seventies O
there O
developed O
an O
appreciation O
of O
the O
necessity O
for O
a O
bathroom O
. O
Therefore O
the O
architects O
placed O
bathrooms O
in O
the O
new O
houses O
, O
and O
the O
older O
houses O
tore O
out O
a O
cupboard O
or O
two O
, O
set O
up O
a O
boiler O
beside O
the O
kitchen O
stove O
, O
and O
sought O
a O
new O
godliness O
, O
each O
with O
its O
own O
bathroom O
. O
The O
great O
American O
plumber O
joke O
, O
that O
many-branched O
evergreen O
, O
was O
planted O
at O
this O
time O
. O
At O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
house O
, O
upstairs O
was O
a O
bleak O
little O
chamber O
, O
called O
" O
the O
girl O
's O
room O
, O
" O
and O
in O
the O
stable O
there O
was O
another O
bedroom O
, O
adjoining O
the O
hayloft O
, O
and O
called O
" O
the O
hired O
man O
's O
room O
. O
" O
House O
and O
stable O
cost O
seven O
or O
eight O
thousand O
dollars O
to O
build O
, O
and O
people O
with O
that O
much O
money O
to O
invest O
in O
such O
comforts O
were O
classified O
as O
the O
Rich O
. O
They O
paid O
the O
inhabitant O
of O
" O
the O
girl O
's O
room O
" O
two O
dollars O
a O
week O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
this O
period O
, O
two O
dollars O
and O
a O
half O
, O
and O
finally O
three O
dollars O
a O
week O
. O
She O
was O
Irish O
, O
ordinarily O
, O
or O
German O
or O
it O
might O
be O
Scandinavian O
, O
but O
never O
native O
to O
the O
land O
unless O
she O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
person O
of O
colour O
. O
The O
man O
or O
youth O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
stable O
had O
like O
wages O
, O
and O
sometimes O
he O
, O
too O
, O
was O
lately O
a O
steerage O
voyager O
, O
but O
much O
oftener O
he O
was O
coloured O
. O
After O
sunrise O
, O
on O
pleasant O
mornings O
, O
the O
alleys O
behind O
the O
stables O
were O
gay O
; O
laughter O
and O
shouting O
went O
up O
and O
down O
their O
dusty O
lengths O
, O
with O
a O
lively O
accompaniment O
of O
curry-combs O
knocking O
against O
back O
fences O
and O
stable O
walls O
, O
for O
the O
darkies O
loved O
to O
curry O
their O
horses O
in O
the O
alley O
. O
Darkies O
always O
prefer O
to O
gossip O
in O
shouts O
instead O
of O
whispers O
; O
and O
they O
feel O
that O
profanity O
, O
unless O
it O
be O
vociferous O
, O
is O
almost O
worthless O
. O
Horrible O
phrases O
were O
caught O
by O
early O
rising O
children O
and O
carried O
to O
older O
people O
for O
definition O
, O
sometimes O
at O
inopportune O
moments O
; O
while O
less O
investigative O
children O
would O
often O
merely O
repeat O
the O
phrases O
in O
some O
subsequent O
flurry O
of O
agitation O
, O
and O
yet O
bring O
about O
consequences O
so O
emphatic O
as O
to O
be O
recalled O
with O
ease O
in O
middle O
life O
. O
They O
have O
passed O
, O
those O
darky O
hired-men O
of O
the O
Midland O
town O
; O
and O
the O
introspective O
horses O
they O
curried O
and O
brushed O
and O
whacked O
and O
amiably O
cursed O
-- O
those O
good O
old O
horses O
switch O
their O
tails O
at O
flies O
no O
more O
. O
For O
all O
their O
seeming O
permanence O
they O
might O
as O
well O
have O
been O
buffaloes O
-- O
or O
the O
buffalo O
laprobes O
that O
grew O
bald O
in O
patches O
and O
used O
to O
slide O
from O
the O
careless O
drivers O
' O
knees O
and O
hang O
unconcerned O
, O
half O
way O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
The O
stables O
have O
been O
transformed O
into O
other O
likenesses O
, O
or O
swept O
away O
, O
like O
the O
woodsheds O
where O
were O
kept O
the O
stove-wood O
and O
kindling O
that O
the O
" O
girl O
" O
and O
the O
" O
hired-man O
" O
always O
quarrelled O
over O
: O
who O
should O
fetch O
it O
. O
Horse O
and O
stable O
and O
woodshed O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
tribe O
of O
the O
" O
hired-man O
, O
" O
all O
are O
gone O
. O
They O
went O
quickly O
, O
yet O
so O
silently O
that O
we O
whom O
they O
served O
have O
not O
yet O
really O
noticed O
that O
they O
are O
vanished O
. O
So O
with O
other O
vanishings O
. O
There O
were O
the O
little O
bunty O
street-cars O
on O
the O
long O
, O
single O
track O
that O
went O
its O
troubled O
way O
among O
the O
cobblestones O
. O
At O
the O
rear O
door O
of O
the O
car O
there O
was O
no O
platform O
, O
but O
a O
step O
where O
passengers O
clung O
in O
wet O
clumps O
when O
the O
weather O
was O
bad O
and O
the O
car O
crowded O
. O
The O
patrons O
-- O
if O
not O
too O
absent-minded O
-- O
put O
their O
fares O
into O
a O
slot O
; O
and O
no O
conductor O
paced O
the O
heaving O
floor O
, O
but O
the O
driver O
would O
rap O
remindingly O
with O
his O
elbow O
upon O
the O
glass O
of O
the O
door O
to O
his O
little O
open O
platform O
if O
the O
nickels O
and O
the O
passengers O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
coincide O
in O
number O
. O
A O
lone O
mule O
drew O
the O
car O
, O
and O
sometimes O
drew O
it O
off O
the O
track O
, O
when O
the O
passengers O
would O
get O
out O
and O
push O
it O
on O
again O
. O
They O
really O
owed O
it O
courtesies O
like O
this O
, O
for O
the O
car O
was O
genially O
accommodating O
: O
a O
lady O
could O
whistle O
to O
it O
from O
an O
upstairs O
window O
, O
and O
the O
car O
would O
halt O
at O
once O
and O
wait O
for O
her O
while O
she O
shut O
the O
window O
, O
put O
on O
her O
hat O
and O
cloak O
, O
went O
downstairs O
, O
found O
an O
umbrella O
, O
told O
the O
" O
girl O
" O
what O
to O
have O
for O
dinner O
, O
and O
came O
forth O
from O
the O
house O
. O
The O
previous O
passengers O
made O
little O
objection O
to O
such O
gallantry O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
car O
: O
they O
were O
wont O
to O
expect O
as O
much O
for O
themselves O
on O
like O
occasion O
. O
In O
good O
weather O
the O
mule O
pulled O
the O
car O
a O
mile O
in O
a O
little O
less O
than O
twenty O
minutes O
, O
unless O
the O
stops O
were O
too O
long O
; O
but O
when O
the O
trolley-car O
came O
, O
doing O
its O
mile O
in O
five O
minutes O
and O
better O
, O
it O
would O
wait O
for O
nobody O
. O
Nor O
could O
its O
passengers O
have O
endured O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
because O
the O
faster O
they O
were O
carried O
the O
less O
time O
they O
had O
to O
spare O
! O
In O
the O
days O
before O
deathly O
contrivances O
hustled O
them O
through O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
when O
they O
had O
no O
telephones O
-- O
another O
ancient O
vacancy O
profoundly O
responsible O
for O
leisure O
-- O
they O
had O
time O
for O
everything O
: O
time O
to O
think O
, O
to O
talk O
, O
time O
to O
read O
, O
time O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
lady O
! O

During O
the O
whole O
of O
a O
dull O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
soundless O
day O
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
the O
year O
, O
when O
the O
clouds O
hung O
oppressively O
low O
in O
the O
heavens O
, O
I PRON_PER
had O
been O
passing O
alone O
, O
on O
horseback O
, O
through O
a O
singularly O
dreary O
tract O
of O
country O
; O
and O
at O
length O
found O
myself PRON_PER
, O
as O
the O
shades O
of O
the O
evening O
drew O
on O
, O
within O
view O
of O
the O
melancholy O
House O
of O
Usher PROP_PER
. O
I PRON_PER
know O
not O
how O
it O
was O
-- O
but O
, O
with O
the O
first O
glimpse O
of O
the O
building O
, O
a O
sense O
of O
insufferable O
gloom O
pervaded O
my PRON_PER
spirit O
. O
I PRON_PER
say O
insufferable O
; O
for O
the O
feeling O
was O
unrelieved O
by O
any O
of O
that O
half-pleasureable O
, O
because O
poetic O
, O
sentiment O
, O
with O
which O
the O
mind O
usually O
receives O
even O
the O
sternest O
natural O
images O
of O
the O
desolate O
or O
terrible O
. O
I PRON_PER
looked O
upon O
the O
scene O
before O
me PRON_PER
-- O
upon O
the O
mere O
house O
, O
and O
the O
simple O
landscape O
features O
of O
the O
domain O
-- O
upon O
the O
bleak O
walls O
-- O
upon O
the O
vacant O
eye-like O
windows O
-- O
upon O
a O
few O
rank O
sedges O
-- O
and O
upon O
a O
few O
white O
trunks O
of O
decayed O
trees O
-- O
with O
an O
utter O
depression O
of O
soul O
which O
I PRON_PER
can O
compare O
to O
no O
earthly O
sensation O
more O
properly O
than O
to O
the O
after-dream O
of O
the NOM_PER
reveller NOM_PER
upon O
opium O
-- O
the O
bitter O
lapse O
into O
everyday O
life O
-- O
the O
hideous O
dropping O
off O
of O
the O
veil O
. O
There O
was O
an O
iciness O
, O
a O
sinking O
, O
a O
sickening O
of O
the O
heart O
-- O
an O
unredeemed O
dreariness O
of O
thought O
which O
no O
goading O
of O
the O
imagination O
could O
torture O
into O
aught O
of O
the O
sublime O
. O
What O
was O
it O
-- O
I PRON_PER
paused O
to O
think O
-- O
what O
was O
it O
that O
so O
unnerved O
me PRON_PER
in O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O
House O
of O
Usher PROP_PER
? O
It O
was O
a O
mystery O
all O
insoluble O
; O
nor O
could O
I PRON_PER
grapple O
with O
the O
shadowy O
fancies O
that O
crowded O
upon O
me PRON_PER
as O
I PRON_PER
pondered O
. O
I PRON_PER
was O
forced O
to O
fall O
back O
upon O
the O
unsatisfactory O
conclusion O
, O
that O
while O
, O
beyond O
doubt O
, O
there O
are O
combinations O
of O
very O
simple O
natural O
objects O
which O
have O
the O
power O
of O
thus O
affecting O
us PRON_PER
, O
still O
the O
analysis O
of O
this O
power O
lies O
among O
considerations O
beyond O
our PRON_PER
depth O
. O
It O
was O
possible O
, O
I PRON_PER
reflected O
, O
that O
a O
mere O
different O
arrangement O
of O
the O
particulars O
of O
the O
scene O
, O
of O
the O
details O
of O
the O
picture O
, O
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
modify O
, O
or O
perhaps O
to O
annihilate O
its O
capacity O
for O
sorrowful O
impression O
; O
and O
, O
acting O
upon O
this O
idea O
, O
I PRON_PER
reined O
my PRON_PER
horse O
to O
the O
precipitous O
brink O
of O
a O
black O
and O
lurid O
tarn O
that O
lay O
in O
unruffled O
lustre O
by O
the O
dwelling O
, O
and O
gazed O
down O
-- O
but O
with O
a O
shudder O
even O
more O
thrilling O
than O
before O
-- O
upon O
the O
remodelled O
and O
inverted O
images O
of O
the O
grey O
sedge O
, O
and O
the O
ghastly O
tree-stems O
, O
and O
the O
vacant O
and O
eye-like O
windows O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
in O
this O
mansion O
of O
gloom O
I PRON_PER
now O
proposed O
to O
myself PRON_PER
a O
sojourn O
of O
some O
weeks O
. O
Its NOM_PER
proprietor NOM_PER
, O
Roderick PROP_PER
Usher PROP_PER
, O
had O
been O
one NOM_PER
of NOM_PER
my NOM_PER
boon NOM_PER
companions NOM_PER
in NOM_PER
boyhood NOM_PER
; O
but O
many O
years O
had O
elapsed O
since O
our O
last O
meeting O
. O
A O
letter O
, O
however O
, O
had O
lately O
reached O
me O
in O
a O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
country O
-- O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
-- O
which O
, O
in O
its O
wildly O
importunate O
nature O
, O
had O
admitted O
of O
no O
other O
than O
a O
personal O
reply O
. O
The O
MS O
gave O
evidence O
of O
nervous O
agitation O
. O
The O
writer O
spoke O
of O
acute O
bodily O
illness O
-- O
of O
a O
mental O
disorder O
which O
oppressed O
him O
-- O
and O
of O
an O
earnest O
desire O
to O
see O
me O
, O
as O
his O
best O
, O
and O
indeed O
his O
only O
personal O
friend O

with O
a O
view O
of O
attempting O

by O
the O
cheerfulness O
of O
my O
society O
, O
some O
alleviation O
of O
his O
malady O
. O
It O
was O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
all O
this O
, O
and O
much O
more O
, O
was O
said O
-- O
it O
was O
the O
apparent O
heart O
that O
went O
with O
his O
request O
-- O
which O
allowed O
me O
no O
room O
for O
hesitation O
; O
and O
I O
accordingly O
obeyed O
forthwith O
what O
I O
still O
considered O
a O
very O
singular O
summons O
. O
Although O
, O
as O
boys O
, O
we O
had O
been O
even O
intimate O
associates O
, O
yet O
I O
really O
knew O
little O
of O
my O
friend O
. O
His O
reserve O
had O
been O
always O
excessive O
and O
habitual O
. O
I O
was O
aware O
, O
however O
, O
that O
his O
very O
ancient O
family O
had O
been O
noted O
, O
time O
out O
of O
mind O
, O
for O
a O
peculiar O
sensibility O
of O
temperament O
, O
displaying O
itself O
, O
through O
long O
ages O
, O
in O
many O
works O
of O
exalted O
art O
, O
and O
manifested O
, O
of O
late O
, O
in O
repeated O
deeds O
of O
munificent O
yet O
unobtrusive O
charity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
a O
passionate O
devotion O
to O
the O
intricacies O
, O
perhaps O
even O
more O
than O
to O
the O
orthodox O
and O
easily O
recognisable O
beauties O
of O
musical O
science O
. O
I O
had O
learned O
, O
too O
, O
the O
very O
remarkable O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
stem O
of O
the O
Usher O
race O
, O
all O
time-honoured O
as O
it O
was O
, O
had O
put O
forth O
, O
at O
no O
period O
, O
any O
enduring O
branch O
; O
in O
other O
words O
, O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
lay O
in O
the O
direct O
line O
of O
descent O
, O
and O
had O
always O
, O
with O
very O
trifling O
and O
very O
temporary O
variation O
, O
so O
lain O
. O
It O
was O
this O
deficiency O
, O
I O
considered O
, O
while O
running O
over O
in O
thought O
the O
perfect O
keeping O
of O
the O
character O
of O
the O
premises O
with O
the O
accredited O
character O
of O
the O
people O
, O
and O
while O
speculating O
upon O
the O
possible O
influence O
which O
the O
one O
, O
in O
the O
long O
lapse O
of O
centuries O
, O
might O
have O
exercised O
upon O
the O
other O
-- O
it O
was O
this O
deficiency O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
collateral O
issue O
, O
and O
the O
consequent O
undeviating O
transmission O
, O
from O
sire O
to O
son O
, O
of O
the O
patrimony O
with O
the O
name O
, O
which O
had O
, O
at O
length O
, O
so O
identified O
the O
two O
as O
to O
merge O
the O
original O
title O
of O
the O
estate O
in O
the O
quaint O
and O
equivocal O
appellation O
of O
the O
" O
House O
of O
Usher O
" O
-- O
an O
appellation O
which O
seemed O
to O
include O
, O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
peasantry O
who O
used O
it O
, O
both O
the O
family O
and O
the O
family O
mansion O
. O
I O
have O
said O
that O
the O
sole O
effect O
of O
my O
somewhat O
childish O
experiment O
-- O
that O
of O
looking O
down O
within O
the O
tarn O
-- O
had O
been O
to O
deepen O
the O
first O
singular O
impression O
. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
rapid O
increase O
of O
my O
superstition O
-- O
for O
why O
should O
I O
not O
so O
term O
it O
? O
-- O
served O
mainly O
to O
accelerate O
the O
increase O
itself O
. O
Such O
, O
I O
have O
long O
known O
, O
is O
the O
paradoxical O
law O
of O
all O
sentiments O
having O
terror O
as O
a O
basis O
. O
And O
it O
might O
have O
been O
for O
this O
reason O
only O
, O
that O
, O
when O
I O
again O
uplifted O
my O
eyes O
to O
the O
house O
itself O
, O
from O
its O
image O
in O
the O
pool O
, O
there O
grew O
in O
my O
mind O
a O
strange O
fancy O
-- O
a O
fancy O
so O
ridiculous O
, O
indeed O
, O
that O
I O
but O
mention O
it O
to O
show O
the O
vivid O
force O
of O
the O
sensations O
which O
oppressed O
me O
. O
I O
had O
so O
worked O
upon O
my O
imagination O
as O
really O
to O
believe O
that O
about O
the O
whole O
mansion O
and O
domain O
there O
hung O
an O
atmosphere O
peculiar O
to O
themselves O
and O
their O
immediate O
vicinity O
-- O
an O
atmosphere O
which O
had O
no O
affinity O
with O
the O
air O
of O
heaven O
, O
but O
which O
had O
reeked O
up O
from O
the O
decayed O
trees O
, O
and O
the O
grey O
wall O
, O
and O
the O
silent O
tarn O
-- O
a O
pestilent O
and O
mystic O
vapour O
, O
dull O
, O
sluggish O
, O
faintly O
discernible O
, O
and O
leaden-hued O
. O
Shaking O
off O
from O
my O
spirit O
what O
must O
have O
been O
a O
dream O
, O
I O
scanned O
more O
narrowly O
the O
real O
aspect O
of O
the O
building O
. O
Its O
principal O
feature O
seemed O
to O
be O
that O
of O
an O
excessive O
antiquity O
. O
The O
discoloration O
of O
ages O
had O
been O
great O
. O
Minute O
fungi O
overspread O
the O
whole O
exterior O
, O
hanging O
in O
a O
fine O
tangled O
web-work O
from O
the O
eaves O
. O
Yet O
all O
this O
was O
apart O
from O
any O
extraordinary O
dilapidation O
. O
No O
portion O
of O
the O
masonry O
had O
fallen O
; O
and O
there O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
wild O
inconsistency O
between O
its O
still O
perfect O
adaptation O
of O
parts O
, O
and O
the O
crumbling O
condition O
of O
the O
individual O
stones O
. O
In O
this O
there O
was O
much O
that O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
specious O
totality O
of O
old O
wood-work O
which O
has O
rotted O
for O
long O
years O
in O
some O
neglected O
vault O
, O
with O
no O
disturbance O
from O
the O
breath O
of O
the O
external O
air O
. O
Beyond O
this O
indication O
of O
extensive O
decay O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fabric O
gave O
little O
token O
of O
instability O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
scrutinizing O
observer O
might O
have O
discovered O
a O
barely O
perceptible O
fissure O
, O
which O
, O
extending O
from O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
building O
in O
front O
, O
made O
its O
way O
down O
the O
wall O
in O
a O
zigzag O
direction O
, O
until O
it O
became O
lost O
in O
the O
sullen O
waters O
of O
the O
tarn O
. O
Noticing O
these O
things O
, O
I O
rode O
over O
a O
short O
causeway O
to O
the O
house O
. O
A O
servant O
in O
waiting O
took O
my O
horse O
, O
and O
I O
entered O
the O
Gothic O
archway O
of O
the O
hall O
. O
A O
valet O
, O
of O
stealthy O
step O
, O
thence O
conducted O
me O
, O
in O
silence O
, O
through O
many O
dark O
and O
intricate O
passages O
in O
my O
progress O
to O
the O
studio O
of O
his O
master O
. O
Much O
that O
I O
encountered O
on O
the O
way O
contributed O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
, O
to O
heighten O
the O
vague O
sentiments O
of O
which O
I O
have O
already O
spoken O
. O
While O
the O
objects O
around O
me O
-- O
while O
the O
carvings O
of O
the O
ceilings O
, O
the O
sombre O
tapestries O
of O
the O
walls O
, O
the O
ebon O
blackness O
of O
the O
floors O
, O
and O
the O
phantasmagoric O
armorial O
trophies O
which O
rattled O
as O
I O
strode O
, O
were O
but O
matters O
to O
which O
, O
or O
to O
such O
as O
which O
, O
I O
had O
been O
accustomed O
from O
my O
infancy O
-- O
while O
I O
hesitated O
not O
to O
acknowledge O
how O
familiar O
was O
all O
this O
-- O
I O
still O
wondered O
to O
find O
how O
unfamiliar O
were O
the O
fancies O
which O
ordinary O
images O
were O
stirring O
up O
. O
On O
one O
of O
the O
staircases O
, O
I O
met O
the O
physician O
of O
the O
family O
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
wore O
a O
mingled O
expression O
of O
low O
cunning O
and O
perplexity O
. O
He O
accosted O
me O
with O
trepidation O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
The O
valet O
now O
threw O
open O
a O
door O
and O
ushered O
me O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
master O
. O
The O
room O
in O
which O
I O
found O
myself O
was O
very O
large O
and O
lofty O
. O
The O
windows O
were O
long O
, O
narrow O
, O
and O
pointed O
, O
and O
at O
so O
vast O
a O
distance O
from O
the O
black O
oaken O
floor O
as O
to O
be O
altogether O
inaccessible O
from O
within O
. O
Feeble O
gleams O
of O
encrimsoned O
light O
made O
their O
way O
through O
the O
trellised O
panes O
, O
and O
served O
to O
render O
sufficiently O
distinct O
the O
more O
prominent O
objects O
around O
; O
the O
eye O
, O
however O
, O
struggled O
in O
vain O
to O
reach O
the O
remoter O
angles O
of O
the O
chamber O
, O
or O
the O
recesses O
of O
the O
vaulted O
and O
fretted O
ceiling O
. O
Dark O
draperies O
hung O
upon O
the O
walls O
. O
The O
general O
furniture O
was O
profuse O
, O
comfortless O
, O
antique O
, O
and O
tattered O
. O
Many O
books O
and O
musical O
instruments O
lay O
scattered O
about O
, O
but O
failed O
to O
give O
any O
vitality O
to O
the O
scene O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
breathed O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
sorrow O
. O
An O
air O
of O
stern O
, O
deep O
, O
and O
irredeemable O
gloom O
hung O
over O
and O
pervaded O
all O
. O
Upon O
my O
entrance O
, O
Usher O
rose O
from O
a O
sofa O
on O
which O
he O
had O
been O
lying O
at O
full O
length O
, O
and O
greeted O
me O
with O
a O
vivacious O
warmth O
which O
had O
much O
in O
it O
, O
I O
at O
first O
thought O
, O
of O
an O
overdone O
cordiality O
-- O
of O
the O
constrained O
effort O
of O
the O
ennuye O
man O
of O
the O
world O
. O
A O
glance O
, O
however O
, O
at O
his O
countenance O
, O
convinced O
me O
of O
his O
perfect O
sincerity O
. O
We O
sat O
down O
; O
and O
for O
some O
moments O
, O
while O
he O
spoke O
not O
, O
I O
gazed O
upon O
him O
with O
a O
feeling O
half O
of O
pity O
, O
half O
of O
awe O
. O
Surely O
, O
man O
had O
never O
before O
so O
terribly O
altered O
, O
in O
so O
brief O
a O
period O
, O
as O
had O
Roderick O
Usher O
! O
It O
was O
with O
difficulty O
that O
I O
could O
bring O
myself O
to O
admit O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
wan O
being O
before O
me O
with O
the O
companion O
of O
my O
early O
boyhood O
. O
Yet O
the O
character O
of O
his O
face O
had O
been O
at O
all O
times O
remarkable O
. O
A O
cadaverousness O
of O
complexion O
; O
an O
eye O
large O
, O
liquid O
, O
and O
luminous O
beyond O
comparison O
; O
lips O
somewhat O
thin O
and O
very O
pallid O
, O
but O
of O
a O
surpassingly O
beautiful O
curve O
; O
a O
nose O
of O
a O
delicate O
Hebrew O
model O
, O
but O
with O
a O
breadth O
of O
nostril O
unusual O
in O
similar O
formations O
; O
a O
finely-moulded O
chin O
, O
speaking O
, O
in O
its O
want O
of O
prominence O
, O
of O
a O
want O
of O
moral O
energy O
; O
hair O
of O
a O
more O
than O
web-like O
softness O
and O
tenuity O
; O
these O
features O
, O
with O
an O
inordinate O
expansion O
above O
the O
regions O
of O
the O
temple O
, O
made O
up O
altogether O
a O
countenance O
not O
easily O
to O
be O
forgotten O
. O
And O
now O
in O
the O
mere O
exaggeration O
of O
the O
prevailing O
character O
of O
these O
features O
, O
and O
of O
the O
expression O
they O
were O
wont O
to O
convey O
, O
lay O
so O
much O
of O
change O
that O
I O
doubted O
to O
whom O
I O
spoke O
. O
The O
now O
ghastly O
pallor O
of O
the O
skin O
, O
and O
the O
now O
miraculous O
lustre O
of O
the O
eye O
, O
above O
all O
things O
startled O
and O
even O
awed O
me O
. O
The O
silken O
hair O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
suffered O
to O
grow O
all O
unheeded O
, O
and O
as O
, O
in O
its O
wild O
gossamer O
texture O
, O
it O
floated O
rather O
than O
fell O
about O
the O
face O
, O
I O
could O
not O
, O
even O
with O
effort O
, O
connect O
its O
Arabesque O
expression O
with O
any O
idea O
of O
simple O
humanity O
. O

But O
, O
emulating O
the O

of O
the O

they O
learned O
to O

Perhaps O
no O

can O
furnish O
a O

picture O

As O
each O
nation O
of O
the O
Indians O
had O
its O
language O
or O
its O
dialect O
, O
they O
usually O
gave O
different O
names O
to O
the O
same O
places O
, O
though O
nearly O
all O
of O
their O
appellations O
were O
descriptive O
of O
the O
object O

Thus O
a O
literal O
translation O
of O
the O
name O
of O
this O
beautiful O
sheet O
of O
water O
, O
used O
by O
the O
tribe O
that O
dwelt O
on O
its O
banks O

Hence O
, O
the O

With O
the O
high O
plain O
that O
there O
interposed O
itself O
to O
the O
further O
passage O
of O
the O

commenced O
a O
portage O
of O
as O
many O
miles O

which O
conducted O
the O
adventurer O
to O
the O
banks O
of O

with O

they O
were O

not O
overlook O
the O
natural O
advantages O
of O
the O
district O

just O
described O

It O
became O
, O
emphatically O
, O
the O
bloody O
arena O
, O
in O
which O
most O
of O
the O
battles O
for O
the O
mastery O
of O
the O
colonies O
were O
contested O

Forts O
were O
erected O
at O
the O
different O
points O
that O
commanded O
the O

of O
the O

were O
taken O

Though O

were O
alive O

rang O
with O
the O

scene O
of O
strife O

bloodshed O
that O
the O
incidents O

during O

last O
waged O
for O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
country O
that O
neither O
was O
destined O
to O
retain O
. O
The O
imbecility O
of O
her O
military O
leaders O
abroad O
, O
and O
the O
fatal O
want O
of O
energy O
in O
her O
councils O
at O
home O
, O
had O
lowered O
the O
character O
of O
Great O
Britain O
from O
the O
proud O
elevation O
on O
which O
it O
had O
been O
placed O
by O
the O
talents O
and O
enterprise O
of O
her O
former O
warriors O
and O
statesmen O
. O
No O
longer O
dreaded O
by O
her O
enemies O
, O
her O
servants O
were O
fast O
losing O
the O
confidence O
of O

In O
this O
mortifying O
abasement O
, O
the O

, O

innocent O
of O
her O
imbecility O

which O
, O
reverencing O
as O

mother O
, O
they O
had O
blindly O
believed O
invincible O

led O
by O

his O
rare O

disgracefully O
routed O
by O
a O
handful O
of O
French O

, O
and O
only O
saved O
from O
annihilation O
by O
the O
coolness O

spirit O
of O
a O
Virginian O
boy O
, O
whose O
riper O
fame O
has O
since O
diffused O
itself O

with O
the O

* O
A O
wide O
frontier O
had O
been O
laid O
naked O
by O
this O
unexpected O
disaster O
, O
and O
more O
substantial O
evils O
were O
preceded O
by O
a O
thousand O
fanciful O
and O
imaginary O
dangers O
. O
The O
alarmed O
colonists O
believed O
that O
the O
yells O
of O
the O
savages O
mingled O
with O
every O
fitful O
gust O
of O
wind O
that O
issued O
from O
the O
interminable O
forests O
of O
the O
west O
. O
The O
terrific O
character O
of O
their O
merciless O
enemies O
increased O
immeasurably O
the O
natural O
horrors O
of O
warfare O
. O
Numberless O
recent O
massacres O
were O
still O
vivid O
in O
their O
recollections O
; O
nor O
was O
there O
any O
ear O
in O
the O
provinces O
so O
deaf O
as O
not O
to O
have O
drunk O
in O
with O
avidity O
the O
narrative O
of O
some O
fearful O
tale O
of O
midnight O
murder O
, O
in O
which O
the O
natives O
of O
the O
forests O
were O
the O
principal O
and O
barbarous O
actors O
. O
As O
the O
credulous O
and O
excited O
traveler O
related O
the O
hazardous O
chances O
of O
the O
wilderness O
, O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
timid O
curdled O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
mothers O
cast O
anxious O
glances O
even O
at O
those O
children O
which O
slumbered O
within O
the O
security O
of O
the O
largest O
towns O

In O
short O
, O
the O
magnifying O
influence O
of O
fear O
began O
to O
set O
at O
naught O
the O
calculations O

to O
render O
those O

remembered O
their O

the O
slaves O
of O
the O
basest O
passions O

Even O
the O
most O
confident O
and O
the O
stoutest O
hearts O
began O
to O
think O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
contest O
was O
becoming O
doubtful O
; O
and O
that O
abject O
class O
was O
hourly O
increasing O
in O
numbers O

foresaw O
all O
the O

* O
Washington O
, O
who O
, O
after O
uselessly O
admonishing O
the O
European O
general O
of O
the O
danger O
into O
which O
he O
was O
heedlessly O
running O
, O
saved O
the O
remnants O
of O
the O
British O
army O
, O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
by O
his O
decision O
and O
courage O
. O
The O
reputation O
earned O
by O
Washington O
in O
this O
battle O
was O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
his O
being O
selected O
to O
command O
the O
American O
armies O
at O
a O
later O
day O
. O
It O
is O
a O
circumstance O
worthy O
of O
observation O
, O
that O
while O
all O
America O
rang O
with O
his O
well-merited O
reputation O
, O
his O
name O
does O
not O
occur O
in O
any O
European O
account O
of O
the O
battle O
; O
at O
least O
the O
author O
has O
searched O
for O
it O
without O
success O
. O
In O
this O
manner O
does O
the O
mother O
country O
absorb O
even O
the O
fame O
, O
under O
that O
system O
of O
rule O
. O
When O
, O
therefore O
, O
intelligence O
was O
received O
at O
the O
fort O
which O
covered O
the O
southern O
termination O
of O
the O
portage O
between O
the O
Hudson O
and O
the O
lakes O
, O
that O
Montcalm O
had O
been O
seen O
moving O
up O
the O
Champlain O
, O
with O
an O
army O
" O
numerous O
as O
the O
leaves O
on O
the O
trees O
, O
" O
its O
truth O
was O
admitted O
with O
more O
of O
the O
craven O
reluctance O
of O
fear O
than O
with O
the O
stern O
joy O
that O
a O
warrior O
should O
feel O
, O
in O
finding O
an O
enemy O
within O
reach O
of O
his O
blow O
. O
The O
news O
had O
been O
brought O
, O
toward O
the O
decline O
of O
a O
day O
in O
midsummer O
, O
by O
an O
Indian O
runner O
, O
who O
also O
bore O
an O
urgent O
request O
from O
Munro O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
a O
work O
on O
the O
shore O
of O
the O
" O
holy O
lake O
, O
" O
for O
a O
speedy O
and O
powerful O
reinforcement O
. O
It O
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
that O
the O
distance O
between O
these O
two O
posts O
was O
less O
than O
five O
leagues O
. O
The O
rude O
path O
, O
which O
originally O
formed O
their O
line O
of O
communication O
, O
had O
been O
widened O
for O
the O
passage O
of O
wagons O
; O
so O
that O
the O
distance O
which O
had O
been O
traveled O
by O
the O
son O
of O
the O
forest O
in O
two O
hours O
, O
might O
easily O
be O
effected O
by O
a O
detachment O
of O
troops O
, O
with O
their O
necessary O
baggage O
, O
between O
the O
rising O
and O
setting O
of O
a O
summer O
sun O
. O
The O
loyal O
servants O
of O
the O
British O
crown O
had O
given O
to O
one O
of O
these O
forest-fastnesses O
the O
name O
of O
William O
Henry O
, O
and O
to O
the O
other O
that O
of O
Fort O
Edward O
, O
calling O
each O
after O
a O
favorite O
prince O
of O
the O
reigning O
family O
. O
The O
veteran O
Scotchman O
just O
named O
held O
the O
first O
, O
with O
a O
regiment O
of O
regulars O
and O
a O
few O
provincials O
; O
a O
force O
really O
by O
far O
too O
small O
to O
make O
head O
against O
the O
formidable O
power O
that O
Montcalm O
was O
leading O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
his O
earthen O
mounds O
. O
At O
the O
latter O
, O
however O
, O
lay O
General O
Webb O
, O
who O
commanded O
the O
armies O
of O
the O
king O
in O
the O
northern O
provinces O
, O
with O
a O
body O
of O
more O
than O
five O
thousand O
men O
. O
By O
uniting O
the O
several O
detachments O
of O
his O
command O
, O
this O
officer O
might O
have O
arrayed O
nearly O
double O
that O
number O
of O
combatants O
against O
the O
enterprising O
Frenchman O
, O
who O
had O
ventured O
so O
far O
from O
his O
reinforcements O
, O
with O
an O
army O
but O
little O
superior O
in O
numbers O
. O
But O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
their O
degraded O
fortunes O
, O
both O
officers O
and O
men O
appeared O
better O
disposed O
to O
await O
the O
approach O
of O
their O
formidable O
antagonists O
, O
within O
their O
works O
, O
than O
to O
resist O
the O
progress O
of O
their O
march O
, O
by O
emulating O
the O
successful O
example O
of O
the O
French O
at O
Fort O
du O
Quesne O
, O
and O
striking O
a O
blow O
on O
their O
advance O
. O
After O
the O
first O
surprise O
of O
the O
intelligence O
had O
a O
little O
abated O
, O
a O
rumor O
was O
spread O
through O
the O
entrenched O
camp O
, O
which O
stretched O
along O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
Hudson O
, O
forming O
a O
chain O
of O
outworks O
to O
the O
body O
of O
the O
fort O
itself O
, O
that O
a O
chosen O
detachment O
of O
fifteen O
hundred O
men O
was O
to O
depart O
, O
with O
the O
dawn O
, O
for O
William O
Henry O
, O
the O
post O
at O
the O
northern O
extremity O
of O
the O
portage O
. O
That O
which O
at O
first O
was O
only O
rumor O
, O
soon O
became O
certainty O
, O
as O
orders O
passed O
from O
the O
quarters O
of O
the O
commander-in-chief O
to O
the O
several O
corps O
he O
had O
selected O
for O
this O
service O
, O
to O
prepare O
for O
their O
speedy O
departure O
. O
All O
doubts O
as O
to O
the O
intention O
of O
Webb O
now O
vanished O
, O
and O
an O
hour O
or O
two O
of O
hurried O
footsteps O
and O
anxious O
faces O
succeeded O
. O
The O
novice O
in O
the O
military O
art O
flew O
from O
point O
to O
point O
, O
retarding O
his O
own O
preparations O
by O
the O
excess O
of O
his O
violent O
and O
somewhat O
distempered O
zeal O
; O
while O
the O
more O
practiced O
veteran O
made O
his O
arrangements O
with O
a O
deliberation O
that O
scorned O
every O
appearance O
of O
haste O
; O
though O
his O
sober O
lineaments O
and O
anxious O
eye O
sufficiently O
betrayed O
that O
he O
had O
no O
very O
strong O
professional O
relish O
for O
the O
, O
as O
yet O
, O
untried O
and O
dreaded O
warfare O
of O
the O
wilderness O
. O
At O
length O
the O
sun O
set O
in O
a O
flood O
of O
glory O
, O
behind O
the O
distant O
western O
hills O
, O
and O
as O
darkness O
drew O
its O
veil O
around O
the O
secluded O
spot O
the O
sounds O
of O
preparation O
diminished O
; O
the O
last O
light O
finally O
disappeared O
from O
the O
log O
cabin O
of O
some O
officer O
; O
the O
trees O
cast O
their O
deeper O
shadows O
over O
the O
mounds O
and O
the O
rippling O
stream O
, O
and O
a O
silence O
soon O
pervaded O
the O
camp O
, O
as O
deep O
as O
that O
which O
reigned O
in O
the O
vast O
forest O
by O
which O
it O

Rassendylls O
. O
Besides O
her O
attractions O
, O
she O
possessed O
a O
large O
fortune O
, O
and O
my O
brother O
Robert O
was O
wise O
enough O
not O
to O
mind O
about O
her O
ancestry O
. O
Ancestry O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
matter O
concerning O
which O
the O
next O
observation O
of O
Rose O
’s O
has O
some O
truth O
. O
" O
Good O
families O
are O
generally O
worse O
than O
any O
others O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
Upon O
this O
I O
stroked O
my O
hair O
: O
I O
knew O
quite O
well O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
" O
I O
’m O
so O
glad O
Robert O
’s O
is O
black O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
Robert O
( O
who O
rises O
at O
seven O
and O
works O
before O
breakfast O
) O
came O
in O
. O
He O
glanced O
at O
his O
wife O
: O
her O
cheek O
was O
slightly O
flushed O
; O
he O
patted O
it O
caressingly O
. O
" O
What O
’s O
the O
matter O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
She O
objects O
to O
my O
doing O
nothing O
and O
having O
red O
hair O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
in O
an O
injured O
tone O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
of O
course O
he O
ca O
n’t O
help O
his O
hair O
, O
" O
admitted O
Rose O
. O
" O
It O
generally O
crops O
out O
once O
in O
a O
generation O
, O
" O
said O
my O
brother O
. O
" O
So O
does O
the O
nose O
. O
Rudolf O
has O
got O
them O
both O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
they O
did O
n’t O
crop O
out O
, O
" O
said O
Rose O
, O
still O
flushed O
. O
" O
I O
rather O
like O
them O
myself O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
and O
, O
rising O
, O
I O
bowed O
to O
the O
portrait O
of O
Countess O
Amelia O
. O
My O
brother O
’s O
wife O
uttered O
an O
exclamation O
of O
impatience O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
’d O
take O
that O
picture O
away O
, O
Robert O
, O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
! O
" O
he O
cried O
. O
" O
Good O
heavens O
! O
" O
I O
added O
. O
" O
Then O
it O
might O
be O
forgotten O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
. O
" O
Hardly O
-- O
with O
Rudolf O
about O
, O
" O
said O
Robert O
, O
shaking O
his O
head O
. O
" O
Why O
should O
it O
be O
forgotten O
? O
" O
I O
asked O
. O
" O
Rudolf O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
my O
brother O
’s O
wife O
, O
blushing O
very O
prettily O
. O
I O
laughed O
, O
and O
went O
on O
with O
my O
egg O
. O
At O
least O
I O
had O
shelved O
the O
question O
of O
what O
( O
if O
anything O
) O
I O
ought O
to O
do O
. O
And O
, O
by O
way O
of O
closing O
the O
discussion O
-- O
and O
also O
, O
I O
must O
admit O
, O
of O
exasperating O
my O
strict O
little O
sister-in-law O
a O
trifle O
more O
-- O
I O
observed O
: O
" O
I O
rather O
like O
being O
an O
Elphberg O
myself O
. O
" O
When O
I O
read O
a O
story O
, O
I O
skip O
the O
explanations O
; O
yet O
the O
moment O
I O
begin O
to O
write O
one O
, O
I O
find O
that O
I O
must O
have O
an O
explanation O
. O
For O
it O
is O
manifest O
that O
I O
must O
explain O
why O
my O
sister-in-law O
was O
vexed O
with O
my O
nose O
and O
hair O
, O
and O
why O
I O
ventured O
to O
call O
myself O
an O
Elphberg O
. O
For O
eminent O
as O
, O
I O
must O
protest O
, O
the O
Rassendylls O
have O
been O
for O
many O
generations O
, O
yet O
participation O
in O
their O
blood O
of O
course O
does O
not O
, O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
justify O
the O
boast O
of O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
grander O
stock O
of O
the O
Elphbergs O
or O
a O
claim O
to O
be O
one O
of O
that O
Royal O
House O
. O
For O
what O
relationship O
is O
there O
between O
Ruritania O
and O
Burlesdon O
, O
between O
the O
Palace O
at O
Strelsau O
or O
the O
Castle O
of O
Zenda O
and O
Number O
305 O
Park O
Lane O
, O
W. O
? O
Well O
then O
-- O
and O
I O
must O
premise O
that O
I O
am O
going O
, O
perforce O
, O
to O
rake O
up O
the O
very O
scandal O
which O
my O
dear O
Lady O
Burlesdon O
wishes O
forgotten O
-- O
in O
the O
year O
1733 O
, O
George O
II O
. O
sitting O
then O
on O
the O
throne O
, O
peace O
reigning O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
and O
the O
King O
and O
the O
Prince O
of O
Wales O
being O
not O
yet O
at O
loggerheads O
, O
there O
came O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
English O
Court O
a O
certain O
prince O
, O
who O
was O
afterwards O
known O
to O
history O
as O
Rudolf O
the O
Third O
of O
Ruritania O
. O
The O
prince O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
handsome O
young O
fellow O
, O
marked O
( O
maybe O
marred O
, O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
say O
) O
by O
a O
somewhat O
unusually O
long O
, O
sharp O
and O
straight O
nose O
, O
and O
a O
mass O
of O
dark-red O
hair O
-- O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
nose O
and O
the O
hair O
which O
have O
stamped O
the O
Elphbergs O
time O
out O
of O
mind O
. O
He O
stayed O
some O
months O
in O
England O
, O
where O
he O
was O
most O
courteously O
received O
; O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
left O
rather O
under O
a O
cloud O
. O
For O
he O
fought O
a O
duel O
( O
it O
was O
considered O
highly O
well O
bred O
of O
him O
to O
waive O
all O
question O
of O
his O
rank O
) O
with O
a O
nobleman O
, O
well O
known O
in O
the O
society O
of O
the O
day O
, O
not O
only O
for O
his O
own O
merits O
, O
but O
as O
the O
husband O
of O
a O
very O
beautiful O
wife O
. O
In O
that O
duel O
Prince O
Rudolf O
received O
a O
severe O
wound O
, O
and O
, O
recovering O
therefrom O
, O
was O
adroitly O
smuggled O
off O
by O
the O
Ruritanian O
ambassador O
, O
who O
had O
found O
him O
a O
pretty O
handful O
. O
The O
nobleman O
was O
not O
wounded O
in O
the O
duel O
; O
but O
the O
morning O
being O
raw O
and O
damp O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
meeting O
, O
he O
contracted O
a O
severe O
chill O
, O
and O
, O
failing O
to O
throw O
it O
off O
, O
he O
died O
some O
six O
months O
after O
the O
departure O
of O
Prince O
Rudolf O
, O
without O
having O
found O
leisure O
to O
adjust O
his O
relations O
with O
his O
wife O
-- O
who O
, O
after O
another O
two O
months O
, O
bore O
an O
heir O
to O
the O
title O
and O
estates O
of O
the O
family O
of O
Burlesdon O
. O
This O
lady O
was O
the O
Countess O
Amelia O
, O
whose O
picture O
my O
sister-in-law O
wished O
to O
remove O
from O
the O
drawing-room O
in O
Park O
Lane O
; O
and O
her O
husband O
was O
James O
, O
fifth O
Earl O
of O
Burlesdon O
and O
twenty-second O
Baron O
Rassendyll O
, O
both O
in O
the O
peerage O
of O
England O
, O
and O
a O
Knight O
of O
the O
Garter O
. O
As O
for O
Rudolf O
, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Ruritania O
, O
married O
a O
wife O
, O
and O
ascended O
the O
throne O
, O
whereon O
his O
progeny O
in O
the O
direct O
line O
have O
sat O
from O
then O
till O
this O
very O
hour O
-- O
with O
one O
short O
interval O
. O
And O
, O
finally O
, O
if O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
picture O
galleries O
at O
Burlesdon O
, O
among O
the O
fifty O
portraits O
or O
so O
of O
the O
last O
century O
and O
a O
half O
, O
you O
will O
find O
five O
or O
six O
, O
including O
that O
of O
the O
sixth O
earl O
, O
distinguished O
by O
long O
, O
sharp O
, O
straight O
noses O
and O
a O
quantity O
of O
dark-red O
hair O
; O
these O
five O
or O
six O
have O
also O
blue O
eyes O
, O
whereas O
among O
the O
Rassendylls O
dark O
eyes O
are O
the O
commoner O
. O
That O
is O
the O
explanation O
, O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
finished O
it O
: O
the O
blemishes O
on O
honourable O
lineage O
are O
a O
delicate O
subject O
, O
and O
certainly O
this O
heredity O
we O
hear O
so O
much O
about O
is O
the O
finest O
scandalmonger O
in O
the O
world O
; O
it O
laughs O
at O
discretion O
, O
and O
writes O
strange O
entries O
between O
the O
lines O
of O
the O
" O
Peerages O
" O
. O
It O
will O
be O
observed O
that O
my O
sister-in-law O
, O
with O
a O
want O
of O
logic O
that O
must O
have O
been O
peculiar O
to O
herself O
( O
since O
we O
are O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
lay O
it O
to O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
sex O
) O
, O
treated O
my O
complexion O
almost O
as O
an O
offence O
for O
which O
I O
was O
responsible O
, O
hastening O
to O
assume O
from O
that O
external O
sign O
inward O
qualities O
of O
which O
I O
protest O
my O
entire O
innocence O
; O
and O
this O
unjust O
inference O
she O
sought O
to O
buttress O
by O
pointing O
to O
the O
uselessness O
of O
the O
life O
I O
had O
led O
. O
Well O
, O
be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
I O
had O
picked O
up O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pleasure O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
knowledge O
. O
I O
had O
been O
to O
a O
German O
school O
and O
a O
German O
university O
, O
and O
spoke O
German O
as O
readily O
and O
perfectly O
as O
English O
; O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
at O
home O
in O
French O
; O
I O
had O
a O
smattering O
of O
Italian O
and O
enough O
Spanish O
to O
swear O
by O
. O
I O
was O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a O
strong O
, O
though O
hardly O
fine O
swordsman O
and O
a O
good O
shot O
. O
I O
could O
ride O
anything O
that O
had O
a O
back O
to O
sit O
on O
; O
and O
my O
head O
was O
as O
cool O
a O
one O
as O
you O
could O
find O
, O
for O
all O
its O
flaming O
cover O
. O
If O
you O
say O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
spent O
my O
time O
in O
useful O
labour O
, O
I O
am O
out O
of O
Court O
and O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
save O
that O
my O
parents O
had O
no O
business O
to O
leave O
me O
two O
thousand O
pounds O
a O
year O
and O
a O
roving O
disposition O
. O
" O
The O
difference O
between O
you O
and O
Robert O
, O
" O
said O
my O
sister-in-law O
, O
who O
often O
( O
bless O
her O
! O
) O
speaks O
on O
a O
platform O
, O
and O
oftener O
still O
as O
if O
she O
were O
on O
one O
, O
" O
is O
that O
he O
recognizes O
the O
duties O
of O
his O
position O
, O
and O
you O
see O
the O
opportunities O
of O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
To O
a O
man O
of O
spirit O
, O
my O
dear O
Rose O
, O
" O
I O
answered O
, O
" O
opportunities O
are O
duties O
. O
" O
" O
Nonsense O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
tossing O
her O
head O
; O
and O
after O
a O
moment O
she O
went O
on O
: O
" O
Now O
, O
here O
’s O
Sir O
Jacob O
Borrodaile O
offering O
you O
exactly O
what O
you O
might O
be O
equal O
to O
. O
" O
" O
A O
thousand O
thanks O
! O
" O
I O
murmured O
. O
" O
He O
’s O
to O
have O
an O
Embassy O
in O
six O
months O
, O
and O
Robert O
says O
he O
is O
sure O
that O
he O
’ll O
take O
you O
as O
an O
attache O
. O
Do O
take O
it O
, O
Rudolf O
-- O
to O
please O
me O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
when O
my O
sister-in-law O
puts O
the O
matter O
in O
that O
way O
, O
wrinkling O
her O
pretty O
brows O
, O
twisting O
her O
little O
hands O
, O
and O
growing O
wistful O
in O
the O
eyes O
, O
all O
on O
account O
of O
an O
idle O
scamp O
like O
myself O
, O
for O
whom O
she O
has O
no O
natural O
responsibility O
, O
I O
am O
visited O
with O
compunction O
. O
Moreover O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
possible O
that O
I O
could O
pass O
the O
time O
in O
the O
position O
suggested O
with O
some O
tolerable O
amusement O
. O
Therefore O
I O
said O
: O
" O
My O
dear O
sister O
, O
if O
in O
six O
months O
’ O
time O
no O
unforeseen O
obstacle O
has O
arisen O
, O
and O
Sir O
Jacob O
invites O
me O
, O
hang O
me O
if O
I O
do O

go O
with O
Sir O
Jacob O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Rudolf O
, O
how O
good O
of O
you O
! O
I O
am O
glad O
! O
" O
" O
Where O
’s O
he O
going O
to O
? O
" O
" O
He O
does O
n’t O
know O
yet O
; O
but O
it O
’s O
sure O
to O
be O
a O
good O
Embassy O
. O
" O
" O
Madame O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
for O
your O
sake O
I O
’ll O
go O
, O
if O
it O
’s O
no O
more O
than O
a O
beggarly O
Legation O
. O
When O
I O
do O
a O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
do O
it O
by O
halves O
. O
" O
My O
promise O
, O
then O
, O
was O
given O
; O
but O
six O
months O
are O
six O
months O
, O
and O
seem O
an O
eternity O
, O
and O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
they O
stretched O
between O
me O
and O
my O
prospective O
industry O
( O
I O
suppose O
attaches O
are O
industrious O
; O
but O
I O
know O
not O
, O
for O
I O
never O
became O
attache O
to O
Sir O
Jacob O
or O
anybody O
else O
) O
, O
I O
cast O
about O
for O
some O
desirable O
mode O
of O
spending O
them O
. O
And O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
suddenly O
that O
I O
would O
visit O
Ruritania O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
strange O
that O
I O
had O
never O
visited O
that O
country O
yet O
; O
but O
my O
father O
( O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
sneaking O
fondness O
for O
the O
Elphbergs O
, O
which O
led O
him O
to O
give O
me O
, O
his O
second O
son O
, O
the O
famous O
Elphberg O
name O
of O
Rudolf O
) O
had O
always O
been O
averse O
from O
my O
going O
, O
and O
, O
since O
his O
death O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
prompted O
by O
Rose O
, O
had O
accepted O
the O
family O
tradition O
which O
taught O
that O
a O
wide O
berth O
was O
to O
be O
given O
to O
that O
country O
. O
But O
the O
moment O
Ruritania O
had O
come O
into O
my O
head O
I O
was O
eaten O
up O
with O
a O
curiosity O
to O
see O
it O
. O
After O
all O
, O
red O
hair O
and O
long O
noses O
are O
not O
confined O
to O
the O
House O
of O
Elphberg O
, O
and O
the O
old O
story O
seemed O
a O
preposterously O
insufficient O
reason O
for O
debarring O
myself O
from O
acquaintance O
with O
a O
highly O
interesting O
and O
important O
kingdom O
, O
one O
which O
had O
played O
no O
small O
part O
in O
European O
history O
, O
and O
might O
do O
the O
like O
again O
under O
the O
sway O
of O
a O
young O
and O
vigorous O
ruler O
, O
such O
as O
the O
new O
King O
was O
rumoured O
to O
be O
. O
My O
determination O
was O
clinched O
by O
reading O
in O
_ O
The O
Times O
_ O
that O
Rudolf O
the O
Fifth O
was O
to O
be O
crowned O
at O
Strelsau O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
that O
great O
magnificence O
was O
to O
mark O
the O
occasion O
. O
At O
once O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
be O
present O
, O
and O
began O
my O
preparations O
. O
But O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
has O
never O
been O
my O
practice O
to O
furnish O
my O
relatives O
with O
an O
itinerary O
of O
my O
journeys O
and O
in O
this O
case O
I O
anticipated O
opposition O
to O
my O
wishes O
, O
I O
gave O
out O
that O
I O
was O
going O
for O
a O
ramble O
in O
the O
Tyrol O
-- O
an O
old O
haunt O
of O
mine O
-- O
and O
propitiated O
Rose O
’s O
wrath O
by O
declaring O
that O
I O
intended O
to O
study O
the O
political O
and O
social O
problems O
of O
the O
interesting O
community O

CHAPTER O
I O
You PRON_PER
must O
go O
back O
with O
me PRON_PER
to O
the O
autumn O
of O
1827 O
. O
My NOM_PER
father NOM_PER
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
gentleman O
farmer O
in O
— O
shire O
; O
and O
I O
, O
by O
his O
express O
desire O
, O
succeeded O
him O
in O
the O
same O
quiet O
occupation O
, O
not O
very O
willingly O
, O
for O
ambition O
urged O
me O
to O
higher O
aims O
, O
and O
self-conceit O
assured O
me O
that O
, O
in O
disregarding O
its O
voice O
, O
I O
was O
burying O
my O
talent O
in O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
hiding O
my O
light O
under O
a O
bushel O
. O
My O
mother O
had O
done O
her O
utmost O
to O
persuade O
me O
that O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
great O
achievements O
; O
but O
my O
father O
, O
who O
thought O
ambition O
was O
the O
surest O
road O
to O
ruin O
, O
and O
change O
but O
another O
word O
for O
destruction O
, O
would O
listen O
to O
no O
scheme O
for O
bettering O
either O
my O
own O
condition O
, O
or O
that O
of O
my O
fellow O
mortals O
. O
He O
assured O
me O
it O
was O
all O
rubbish O
, O
and O
exhorted O
me O
, O
with O
his O
dying O
breath O
, O
to O
continue O
in O
the O
good O
old O
way O
, O
to O
follow O
his O
steps O
, O
and O
those O
of O
his O
father O
before O
him O
, O
and O
let O
my O
highest O
ambition O
be O
to O
walk O
honestly O
through O
the O
world O
, O
looking O
neither O
to O
the O
right O
hand O
nor O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
to O
transmit O
the O
paternal O
acres O
to O
my O
children O
in O
, O
at O
least O
, O
as O
flourishing O
a O
condition O
as O
he O
left O
them O
to O
me O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
— O
an O
honest O
and O
industrious O
farmer O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O
members O
of O
society O
; O
and O
if O
I O
devote O
my O
talents O
to O
the O
cultivation O
of O
my O
farm O
, O
and O
the O
improvement O
of O
agriculture O
in O
general O
, O
I O
shall O
thereby O
benefit O
, O
not O
only O
my O
own O
immediate O
connections O
and O
dependants O
, O
but O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
mankind O
at O
large O
: O
— O
hence O
I O
shall O
not O
have O
lived O
in O
vain O
. O
’ O
With O
such O
reflections O
as O
these O
I O
was O
endeavouring O
to O
console O
myself O
, O
as O
I O
plodded O
home O
from O
the O
fields O
, O
one O
cold O
, O
damp O
, O
cloudy O
evening O
towards O
the O
close O
of O
October O
. O
But O
the O
gleam O
of O
a O
bright O
red O
fire O
through O
the O
parlour O
window O
had O
more O
effect O
in O
cheering O
my O
spirits O
, O
and O
rebuking O
my O
thankless O
repinings O
, O
than O
all O
the O
sage O
reflections O
and O
good O
resolutions O
I O
had O
forced O
my O
mind O
to O
frame O
; O
— O
for O
I O
was O
young O
then O
, O
remember O
— O
only O
four-and-twenty O
— O
and O
had O
not O
acquired O
half O
the O
rule O
over O
my O
own O
spirit O
that O
I O
now O
possess O
— O
trifling O
as O
that O
may O
be O
. O
However O
, O
that O
haven O
of O
bliss O
must O
not O
be O
entered O
till O
I O
had O
exchanged O
my O
miry O
boots O
for O
a O
clean O
pair O
of O
shoes O
, O
and O
my O
rough O
surtout O
for O
a O
respectable O
coat O
, O
and O
made O
myself O
generally O
presentable O
before O
decent O
society O
; O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
with O
all O
her O
kindness O
, O
was O
vastly O
particular O
on O
certain O
points O
. O
In O
ascending O
to O
my O
room O
I O
was O
met O
upon O
the O
stairs O
by O
a O
smart O
, O
pretty O
girl O
of O
nineteen O
, O
with O
a O
tidy O
, O
dumpy O
figure O
, O
a O
round O
face O
, O
bright O
, O
blooming O
cheeks O
, O
glossy O
, O
clustering O
curls O
, O
and O
little O
merry O
brown O
eyes O
. O
I O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
this O
was O
my O
sister O
Rose O
. O
She O
is O
, O
I O
know O
, O
a O
comely O
matron O
still O
, O
and O
, O
doubtless O
, O
no O
less O
lovely O
— O
in O
your O
eyes O
— O
than O
on O
the O
happy O
day O
you O
first O
beheld O
her O
. O
Nothing O
told O
me O
then O
that O
she O
, O
a O
few O
years O
hence O
, O
would O
be O
the O
wife O
of O
one O
entirely O
unknown O
to O
me O
as O
yet O
, O
but O
destined O
hereafter O
to O
become O
a O
closer O
friend O
than O
even O
herself O
, O
more O
intimate O
than O
that O
unmannerly O
lad O
of O
seventeen O
, O
by O
whom O
I O
was O
collared O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
on O
coming O
down O
, O
and O
well-nigh O
jerked O
off O
my O
equilibrium O
, O
and O
who O
, O
in O
correction O
for O
his O
impudence O
, O
received O
a O
resounding O
whack O
over O
the O
sconce O
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
sustained O
no O
serious O
injury O
from O
the O
infliction O
; O
as O
, O
besides O
being O
more O
than O
commonly O
thick O
, O
it O
was O
protected O
by O
a O
redundant O
shock O
of O
short O
, O
reddish O
curls O
, O
that O
my O
mother O
called O
auburn O
. O
On O
entering O
the O
parlour O
we O
found O
that O
honoured O
lady O
seated O
in O
her O
arm-chair O
at O
the O
fireside O
, O
working O
away O
at O
her O
knitting O
, O
according O
to O
her O
usual O
custom O
, O
when O
she O
had O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
. O
She O
had O
swept O
the O
hearth O
, O
and O
made O
a O
bright O
blazing O
fire O
for O
our O
reception O
; O
the O
servant O
had O
just O
brought O
in O
the O
tea-tray O
; O
and O
Rose O
was O
producing O
the O
sugar-basin O
and O
tea-caddy O
from O
the O
cupboard O
in O
the O
black O
oak O
side-board O
, O
that O
shone O
like O
polished O
ebony O
, O
in O
the O
cheerful O
parlour O
twilight O
. O
‘ O
Well O
! O
here O
they O
both O
are O
, O
’ O
cried O
my O
mother O
, O
looking O
round O
upon O
us O
without O
retarding O
the O
motion O
of O
her O
nimble O
fingers O
and O
glittering O
needles O
. O
‘ O
Now O
shut O
the O
door O
, O
and O
come O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
while O
Rose O
gets O
the O
tea O
ready O
; O
I O
’m O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
starved O
; O
— O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
’ve O
been O
about O
all O
day O
; O
— O
I O
like O
to O
know O
what O
my O
children O
have O
been O
about O
. O
’ O
‘ O
I O
’ve O
been O
breaking O
in O
the O
grey O
colt O
— O
no O
easy O
business O
that O
— O
directing O
the O
ploughing O
of O
the O
last O
wheat O
stubble O
— O
for O
the O
ploughboy O
has O
not O
the O
sense O
to O
direct O
himself O
— O
and O
carrying O
out O
a O
plan O
for O
the O
extensive O
and O
efficient O
draining O
of O
the O
low O
meadowlands O
. O
’ O
‘ O
That O
’s O
my O
brave O
boy O
! O
— O
and O
Fergus O
, O
what O
have O
you O
been O
doing O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Badger-baiting O
. O
’ O
And O
here O
he O
proceeded O
to O
give O
a O
particular O
account O
of O
his O
sport O
, O
and O
the O
respective O
traits O
of O
prowess O
evinced O
by O
the O
badger O
and O
the O
dogs O
; O
my O
mother O
pretending O
to O
listen O
with O
deep O
attention O
, O
and O
watching O
his O
animated O
countenance O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
maternal O
admiration O
I O
thought O
highly O
disproportioned O
to O
its O
object O
. O
‘ O
It O
’s O
time O
you O
should O
be O
doing O
something O
else O
, O
Fergus O
, O
’ O
said O
I O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
momentary O
pause O
in O
his O
narration O
allowed O
me O
to O
get O
in O
a O
word O
. O
‘ O
What O
can O
I O
do O
? O
’ O
replied O
he O
; O
‘ O
my O
mother O
wo O
n’t O
let O
me O
go O
to O
sea O
or O
enter O
the O
army O
; O
and O
I O
’m O
determined O
to O
do O
nothing O
else O
— O
except O
make O
myself O
such O
a O
nuisance O
to O
you O
all O
, O
that O
you O
will O
be O
thankful O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
me O
on O
any O
terms O
. O
’ O
Our O
parent O
soothingly O
stroked O
his O
stiff O
, O
short O
curls O
. O
He O
growled O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
look O
sulky O
, O
and O
then O
we O
all O
took O
our O
seats O
at O
the O
table O
, O
in O
obedience O
to O
the O
thrice-repeated O
summons O
of O
Rose O
. O
‘ O
Now O
take O
your O
tea O
, O
’ O
said O
she O
; O
‘ O
and O
I O
’ll O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
’ve O
been O
doing O
. O
I O
’ve O
been O
to O
call O
on O
the O
Wilsons O
; O
and O
it O
’s O
a O
thousand O
pities O
you O
did O
n’t O
go O
with O
me O
, O
Gilbert O
, O
for O
Eliza O
Millward O
was O
there O
! O
’ O
‘ O
Well O
! O
what O
of O
her O
? O
’ O
‘ O
Oh O
, O
nothing O
! O
— O
I O
’m O
not O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
her O
; O
— O
only O
that O
she O
’s O
a O
nice O
, O
amusing O
little O
thing O
, O
when O
she O
is O
in O
a O
merry O
humour O
, O
and O
I O
should O
n’t O
mind O
calling O
her O
— O
’ O
‘ O
Hush O
, O
hush O
, O
my O
dear O
! O
your O
brother O
has O
no O
such O
idea O

whispered O
my O
mother O
earnestly O
, O
holding O
up O
her O
finger O
. O
‘ O
Well O
, O
’ O
resumed O
Rose O
; O
‘ O
I O
was O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
an O
important O
piece O
of O
news O
I O
heard O
there O

I O
have O
been O
bursting O
with O
it O
ever O
since O
. O
You O
know O
it O
was O
reported O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
that O
somebody O
was O
going O
to O
take O
Wildfell O
Hall O
— O
and O
— O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O
It O
has O
actually O
been O
inhabited O
above O
a O
week O
! O
— O
and O
we O
never O
knew O
! O
’ O
‘ O
Impossible O
! O

my O
mother O

‘ O
Preposterous O

Fergus O

‘ O
It O

indeed O

a O

lady O

Oh O

dear O
! O
that O

I O
’d O

Fergus O

while O
carving O
his O
inch-thick O
slice O
of O
bread O

‘ O
Nonsense O

But O
is O

’ O
‘ O
Strange O
! O
I O
can O
hardly O
believe O
it O

’ O
‘ O
But O
you O
may O
believe O
it O
; O
for O
Jane O
Wilson O
has O
seen O
her O

She O
went O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
she O
heard O
of O
a O
stranger O
being O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
would O
be O
on O
pins O
and O
needles O
till O
she O
had O
seen O
her O
and O
got O
all O
she O
could O
out O
of O
her O

She O
is O
called O
Mrs. O
Graham O

and O
she O
is O
in O
mourning O

not O

slightish O
mourning O

quite O
young O

— O
not O
above O
five O

six O

twenty O

so O

tried O
all O
they O

to O
find O
out O
who O
she O
was O

where O
she O
came O
from O

all O
about O
her O

impertinent O
home-thrusts O

Miss O
Wilson O
, O
with O

elicit O
a O

answer O

But O
Eliza O

soon O

she O
is O

early O

she O
did O
not O
make O
her O

she O
— O
Eliza O

that O

accompany O
him O

sure O

something O
out O
of O
her O

she O
can O
do O
anything O

we O

call O
some O
time O

what O

all O

I O
know O

said O
Fergus O
, O
very O
gravely O
. O
But O
if O
he O
intended O
the O
speech O
to O
be O
hailed O
as O
a O
master-stroke O
of O
wit O
, O
he O
signally O
failed O
, O
for O
nobody O
laughed O
. O
However O
, O
he O
was O
not O
much O
disconcerted O
at O
that O
; O
for O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
mouthful O
of O
bread O
and O
butter O
and O
was O
about O
to O
swallow O
a O
gulp O
of O
tea O

the O
humour O
of O
the O
thing O
burst O
upon O
him O
with O
such O
irresistible O
force O

that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
jump O
up O
from O
the O
table O
, O
and O
rush O
snorting O
and O
choking O
from O
the O
room O
; O
and O
a O
minute O
after O
, O
was O
heard O
screaming O
in O
fearful O
agony O
in O
the O
garden O
. O
As O
for O
me O
, O
I O
was O
hungry O
, O
and O
contented O
myself O
with O
silently O
demolishing O
the O
tea O
, O
ham O
, O
and O
toast O
, O
while O
my O
mother O
and O
sister O
went O
on O
talking O
, O
and O
continued O
to O
discuss O
the O
apparent O
or O
non-apparent O
circumstances O
, O
and O
probable O
or O
improbable O
history O
of O
the O
mysterious O
lady O
; O
but O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
, O
after O
my O
brother O
’s O
misadventure O
, O
I O
once O
or O
twice O
raised O
the O
cup O
to O
my O
lips O
, O
and O
put O
it O
down O
again O
without O
daring O
to O
taste O
the O
contents O
, O
lest O
I O
should O
injure O
my O
dignity O
by O
a O
similar O
explosion O

CHAPTER O
I O
Mr PROP_PER
Verloc PROP_PER
, O
going O
out O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
left O
his PRON_PER
shop O
nominally O
in O
charge O
of O
his NOM_PER
brother-in-law NOM_PER
. O
It O
could O
be O
done O
, O
because O
there O
was O
very O
little O
business O
at O
any O
time O
, O
and O
practically O
none O
at O
all O
before O
the O
evening O
. O
Mr O
Verloc O
cared O
but O
little O
about O
his O
ostensible O
business O
. O
And O
, O
moreover O
, O
his O
wife O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
his O
brother-in-law O
. O
The O
shop O
was O
small O
, O
and O
so O
was O
the O
house O
. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
those O
grimy O
brick O
houses O
which O
existed O
in O
large O
quantities O
before O
the O
era O
of O
reconstruction O
dawned O
upon O
London O
. O
The O
shop O
was O
a O
square O
box O
of O
a O
place O
, O
with O
the O
front O
glazed O
in O
small O
panes O
. O
In O
the O
daytime O
the O
door O
remained O
closed O
; O
in O
the O
evening O
it O
stood O
discreetly O
but O
suspiciously O
ajar O
. O
The O
window O
contained O
photographs O
of O
more O
or O
less O
undressed O
dancing O
girls O
; O
nondescript O
packages O
in O
wrappers O
like O
patent O
medicines O
; O
closed O
yellow O
paper O
envelopes O
, O
very O
flimsy O
, O
and O
marked O
two-and-six O
in O
heavy O
black O
figures O
; O
a O
few O
numbers O
of O
ancient O
French O
comic O
publications O
hung O
across O
a O
string O
as O
if O
to O
dry O
; O
a O
dingy O
blue O
china O
bowl O
, O
a O
casket O
of O
black O
wood O
, O
bottles O
of O
marking O
ink O
, O
and O
rubber O
stamps O
; O
a O
few O
books O
, O
with O
titles O
hinting O
at O
impropriety O
; O
a O
few O
apparently O
old O
copies O
of O
obscure O
newspapers O
, O
badly O
printed O
, O
with O
titles O
like O
_ O
The O
Torch O
_ O
, O
_ O
The O
Gong O
_ O
— O
rousing O
titles O
. O
And O
the O
two O
gas O
jets O
inside O
the O
panes O
were O
always O
turned O
low O
, O
either O
for O
economy O
’s O
sake O
or O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
customers O
. O
These O
customers O
were O
either O
very O
young O
men O
, O
who O
hung O
about O
the O
window O
for O
a O
time O
before O
slipping O
in O
suddenly O
; O
or O
men O
of O
a O
more O
mature O
age O
, O
but O
looking O
generally O
as O
if O
they O
were O
not O
in O
funds O
. O
Some O
of O
that O
last O
kind O
had O
the O
collars O
of O
their O
overcoats O
turned O
right O
up O
to O
their O
moustaches O
, O
and O
traces O
of O
mud O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
their O
nether O
garments O
, O
which O
had O
the O
appearance O
of O
being O
much O
worn O
and O
not O
very O
valuable O
. O
And O
the O
legs O
inside O
them O
did O
not O
, O
as O
a O
general O
rule O
, O
seem O
of O
much O
account O
either O
. O
With O
their O
hands O
plunged O
deep O
in O
the O
side O
pockets O
of O
their O
coats O
, O
they O
dodged O
in O
sideways O
, O
one O
shoulder O
first O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
to O
start O
the O
bell O
going O
. O
The O
bell O
, O
hung O
on O
the O
door O
by O
means O
of O
a O
curved O
ribbon O
of O
steel O
, O
was O
difficult O
to O
circumvent O
. O
It O
was O
hopelessly O
cracked O
; O
but O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
at O
the O
slightest O
provocation O
, O
it O
clattered O
behind O
the O
customer O
with O
impudent O
virulence O
. O
It O
clattered O
; O
and O
at O
that O
signal O
, O
through O
the O
dusty O
glass O
door O
behind O
the O
painted O
deal O
counter O
, O
Mr O
Verloc O
would O
issue O
hastily O
from O
the O
parlour O
at O
the O
back O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
naturally O
heavy O
; O
he O
had O
an O
air O
of O
having O
wallowed O
, O
fully O
dressed O
, O
all O
day O
on O
an O
unmade O
bed O
. O
Another O
man O
would O
have O
felt O
such O
an O
appearance O
a O
distinct O
disadvantage O
. O
In O
a O
commercial O
transaction O
of O
the O
retail O
order O
much O
depends O
on O
the O
seller O
’s O
engaging O
and O
amiable O
aspect O
. O
But O
Mr O
Verloc O
knew O
his O
business O
, O
and O
remained O
undisturbed O
by O
any O
sort O
of O
æsthetic O
doubt O
about O
his O
appearance O
. O
With O
a O
firm O
, O
steady-eyed O
impudence O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
hold O
back O
the O
threat O
of O
some O
abominable O
menace O
, O
he O
would O
proceed O
to O
sell O
over O
the O
counter O
some O
object O
looking O
obviously O
and O
scandalously O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
which O
passed O
in O
the O
transaction O
: O
a O
small O
cardboard O
box O
with O
apparently O
nothing O
inside O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
or O
one O
of O
those O
carefully O
closed O
yellow O
flimsy O
envelopes O
, O
or O
a O
soiled O
volume O
in O
paper O
covers O
with O
a O
promising O
title O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
it O
happened O
that O
one O
of O
the O
faded O
, O
yellow O
dancing O
girls O
would O
get O
sold O
to O
an O
amateur O
, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
been O
alive O
and O
young O
. O
Sometimes O
it O
was O
Mrs O
Verloc O
who O
would O
appear O
at O
the O
call O
of O
the O
cracked O
bell O
. O
Winnie O
Verloc O
was O
a O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
full O
bust O
, O
in O
a O
tight O
bodice O
, O
and O
with O
broad O
hips O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
very O
tidy O
. O
Steady-eyed O
like O
her O
husband O
, O
she O
preserved O
an O
air O
of O
unfathomable O
indifference O
behind O
the O
rampart O
of O
the O
counter O
. O
Then O
the O
customer O
of O
comparatively O
tender O
years O
would O
get O
suddenly O
disconcerted O
at O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
woman O
, O
and O
with O
rage O
in O
his O
heart O
would O
proffer O
a O
request O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
marking O
ink O
, O
retail O
value O
sixpence O
( O
price O
in O
Verloc O
’s O
shop O
one-and-sixpence O
) O
, O
which O
, O
once O
outside O
, O
he O
would O
drop O
stealthily O
into O
the O
gutter O
. O
The O
evening O
visitors O
— O
the O
men O
with O
collars O
turned O
up O
and O
soft O
hats O
rammed O
down O
— O
nodded O
familiarly O
to O
Mrs O
Verloc O
, O
and O
with O
a O
muttered O
greeting O
, O
lifted O
up O
the O
flap O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
counter O
in O
order O
to O
pass O
into O
the O
back O
parlour O
, O
which O
gave O
access O
to O
a O
passage O
and O
to O
a O
steep O
flight O
of O
stairs O
. O
The O
door O
of O
the O
shop O
was O
the O
only O
means O
of O
entrance O
to O
the O
house O
in O
which O
Mr O
Verloc O
carried O
on O
his O
business O
of O
a O
seller O
of O
shady O
wares O
, O
exercised O
his O
vocation O
of O
a O
protector O
of O
society O
, O
and O
cultivated O
his O
domestic O
virtues O
. O
These O
last O
were O
pronounced O
. O
He O
was O
thoroughly O
domesticated O
. O
Neither O
his O
spiritual O
, O
nor O
his O
mental O
, O
nor O
his O
physical O
needs O
were O
of O
the O
kind O
to O
take O
him O
much O
abroad O
. O
He O
found O
at O
home O
the O
ease O
of O
his O
body O
and O
the O
peace O
of O
his O
conscience O
, O
together O
with O
Mrs O
Verloc O
’s O
wifely O
attentions O
and O
Mrs O
Verloc O
’s O
mother O
’s O
deferential O
regard O
. O
Winnie O
’s O
mother O
was O
a O
stout O
, O
wheezy O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
large O
brown O
face O
. O
She O
wore O
a O
black O
wig O
under O
a O
white O
cap O
. O
Her O
swollen O
legs O
rendered O
her O
inactive O
. O
She O
considered O
herself O
to O
be O
of O
French O
descent O
, O
which O
might O
have O
been O
true O
; O
and O
after O
a O
good O
many O
years O
of O
married O
life O
with O
a O
licensed O
victualler O
of O
the O
more O
common O
sort O
, O
she O
provided O
for O
the O
years O
of O
widowhood O
by O
letting O
furnished O
apartments O
for O
gentlemen O
near O
Vauxhall O
Bridge O
Road O
in O
a O
square O
once O
of O
some O
splendour O
and O
still O
included O
in O
the O
district O
of O
Belgravia O
. O
This O
topographical O
fact O
was O
of O
some O
advantage O
in O
advertising O
her O
rooms O
; O
but O
the O
patrons O
of O
the O
worthy O
widow O
were O
not O
exactly O
of O
the O
fashionable O
kind O
. O
Such O
as O
they O
were O
, O
her O
daughter O
Winnie O
helped O
to O
look O
after O
them O
. O
Traces O
of O
the O
French O
descent O
which O
the O
widow O
boasted O
of O
were O
apparent O
in O
Winnie O
too O
. O
They O
were O
apparent O
in O
the O
extremely O
neat O
and O
artistic O
arrangement O
of O
her O
glossy O
dark O
hair O
. O
Winnie O
had O
also O
other O
charms O
: O
her O
youth O
; O
her O
full O
, O
rounded O
form O
; O
her O
clear O
complexion O
; O
the O
provocation O
of O
her O
unfathomable O
reserve O
, O
which O
never O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
prevent O
conversation O
, O
carried O
on O
on O
the O
lodgers O
’ O
part O
with O
animation O
, O
and O
on O
hers O
with O
an O
equable O
amiability O
. O
It O
must O
be O
that O
Mr O
Verloc O
was O
susceptible O
to O
these O
fascinations O
. O
Mr O
Verloc O
was O
an O
intermittent O
patron O
. O
He O
came O
and O
went O
without O
any O
very O
apparent O
reason O
. O
He O
generally O
arrived O
in O
London O
( O
like O
the O
influenza O
) O
from O
the O
Continent O
, O
only O
he O
arrived O
unheralded O
by O
the O
Press O
; O
and O
his O
visitations O
set O
in O
with O
great O
severity O
. O
He O
breakfasted O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
remained O
wallowing O
there O
with O
an O
air O
of O
quiet O
enjoyment O
till O
noon O
every O
day O
— O
and O
sometimes O
even O
to O
a O
later O
hour O
. O
But O
when O
he O
went O
out O
he O
seemed O
to O
experience O
a O
great O
difficulty O
in O
finding O
his O
way O
back O
to O
his O
temporary O
home O
in O
the O
Belgravian O
square O
. O
He O
left O
it O
late O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
it O
early O
— O
as O
early O
as O
three O
or O
four O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
and O
on O
waking O
up O
at O
ten O
addressed O
Winnie O
, O
bringing O
in O
the O
breakfast O
tray O
, O
with O
jocular O
, O
exhausted O
civility O
, O
in O
the O
hoarse O
, O
failing O
tones O
of O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
talking O
vehemently O
for O
many O
hours O
together O
. O
His O
prominent O
, O
heavy-lidded O
eyes O
rolled O
sideways O
amorously O
and O
languidly O
, O
the O
bedclothes O
were O
pulled O
up O
to O
his O
chin O
, O
and O
his O
dark O
smooth O
moustache O
covered O
his O
thick O
lips O
capable O
of O
much O
honeyed O
banter O
. O
In O
Winnie O
’s O
mother O
’s O
opinion O
Mr O
Verloc O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
gentleman O
. O
From O
her O
life O
’s O
experience O
gathered O
in O
various O
" O
business O
houses O
" O
the O
good O
woman O
had O
taken O
into O
her O
retirement O
an O
ideal O
of O
gentlemanliness O
as O
exhibited O
by O
the O
patrons O
of O
private-saloon O
bars O
. O
Mr O
Verloc O
approached O
that O
ideal O
; O
he O
attained O
it O
, O
in O
fact O
. O
" O
Of O
course O
, O
we O
’ll O
take O
over O
your O
furniture O
, O
mother O
, O
" O
Winnie O
had O
remarked O
. O
The O
lodging-house O
was O
to O
be O
given O
up O
. O
It O
seems O
it O
would O
not O
answer O
to O
carry O
it O
on O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
too O
much O
trouble O
for O
Mr O
Verloc O
. O
It O
would O
not O
have O
been O
convenient O
for O
his O
other O
business O
. O
What O
his O
business O
was O
he O
did O
not O
say O
; O
but O
after O
his O
engagement O
to O
Winnie O
he O
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
get O
up O
before O
noon O
, O
and O
descending O
the O
basement O
stairs O
, O
make O
himself O
pleasant O
to O
Winnie O
’s O
mother O
in O
the O
breakfast-room O
downstairs O
where O
she O
had O
her O
motionless O
being O
. O
He O
stroked O
the O
cat O
, O
poked O
the O
fire O
, O
had O
his O
lunch O
served O
to O
him O
there O
. O
He O
left O
its O
slightly O
stuffy O
cosiness O
with O
evident O
reluctance O
, O
but O
, O
all O
the O
same O
, O
remained O
out O
till O
the O
night O
was O
far O
advanced O
. O
He O
never O
offered O
to O
take O
Winnie O
to O
theatres O
, O
as O
such O
a O
nice O
gentleman O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
. O
His O
evenings O
were O
occupied O
. O
His O
work O
was O
in O
a O
way O
political O
, O
he O
told O
Winnie O
once O
. O
She O
would O
have O
, O
he O
warned O
her O
, O
to O
be O
very O
nice O
to O
his O
political O
friends O
. O
And O
with O
her O
straight O
, O
unfathomable O
glance O
she O
answered O
that O
she O
would O
be O
so O
, O
of O
course O
. O
How O
much O
more O
he O
told O
her O
as O
to O
his O
occupation O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
Winnie O
’s O
mother O
to O
discover O
. O
The O
married O
couple O
took O
her O
over O
with O
the O
furniture O
. O
The O
mean O
aspect O
of O
the O
shop O
surprised O
her O
. O
The O
change O
from O
the O
Belgravian O
square O
to O
the O
narrow O
street O
in O
Soho O
affected O
her O
legs O
adversely O
. O
They O
became O
of O
an O
enormous O
size O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
she O
experienced O
a O
complete O
relief O
from O
material O
cares O
. O
Her O
son-in-law O
’s O
heavy O
good O
nature O
inspired O
her O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
absolute O
safety O
. O
Her O
daughter O
’s O
future O
was O
obviously O
assured O
, O
and O
even O
as O
to O
her O
son O
Stevie O
she O
need O
have O
no O
anxiety O
. O
She O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
conceal O
from O
herself O
that O
he O
was O
a O
terrible O
encumbrance O
, O
that O
poor O
Stevie O
. O
But O
in O
view O
of O
Winnie O
’s O
fondness O
for O
her O
delicate O
brother O
, O
and O
of O
Mr O
Verloc O
’s O
kind O
and O
generous O
disposition O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
the O
poor O
boy O
was O
pretty O
safe O
in O
this O
rough O
world O
. O
And O
in O
her O
heart O
of O
hearts O
she O
was O
not O
perhaps O
displeased O
that O
the O
Verlocs O
had O
no O
children O
. O
As O
that O
circumstance O
seemed O
perfectly O
indifferent O
to O
Mr O
Verloc O
, O
and O
as O
Winnie O
found O
an O
object O
of O
quasi-maternal O
affection O
in O
her O
brother O
, O
perhaps O
this O
was O
just O
as O
well O
for O
poor O
Stevie O
. O
For O
he O
was O
difficult O
to O
dispose O
of O
, O
that O
boy O
. O
He O
was O
delicate O
and O
, O
in O
a O
frail O
way O
, O
good-looking O
too O
, O
except O
for O
the O
vacant O
droop O
of O
his O
lower O
lip O
. O
Under O
our O
excellent O
system O
of O
compulsory O
education O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
read O
and O
write O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
unfavourable O
aspect O
of O
the O
lower O
lip O
. O
But O
as O
errand-boy O
he O
did O
not O
turn O
out O
a O
great O
success O
. O
He O
forgot O
his O
messages O
; O
he O
was O
easily O
diverted O
from O
the O
straight O
path O
of O
duty O
by O
the O
attractions O
of O
stray O
cats O
and O
dogs O
, O
which O
he O
followed O
down O
narrow O
alleys O
into O
unsavoury O
courts O
; O
by O
the O
comedies O
of O
the O
streets O
, O
which O
he O
contemplated O
open-mouthed O
, O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
his O
employer O
’s O
interests O
; O
or O
by O
the O
dramas O
of O
fallen O
horses O
, O
whose O
pathos O
and O
violence O
induced O
him O
sometimes O
to O
shriek O
pierceingly O
in O
a O
crowd O
, O
which O
disliked O
to O
be O
disturbed O
by O
sounds O
of O
distress O
in O
its O
quiet O
enjoyment O
of O
the O
national O
spectacle O
. O
When O
led O
away O
by O
a O
grave O
and O
protecting O
policeman O
, O
it O
would O
often O
become O
apparent O
that O
poor O
Stevie O
had O
forgotten O
his O
address O
— O
at O
least O
for O
a O
time O
. O
A O
brusque O
question O
caused O
him O
to O
stutter O
to O
the O
point O
of O
suffocation O
. O
When O
startled O
by O
anything O
perplexing O
he O
used O
to O
squint O
horribly O
. O
However O
, O
he O
never O
had O
any O
fits O
( O
which O
was O
encouraging O
) O
; O
and O
before O
the O
natural O
outbursts O
of O
impatience O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
father O
he O
could O
always O
, O
in O
his O
childhood O
’s O
days O
, O
run O
for O
protection O
behind O
the O
short O
skirts O
of O
his O
sister O
Winnie O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
might O
have O
been O
suspected O
of O
hiding O
a O
fund O
of O
reckless O
naughtiness O
. O
When O
he O
had O
reached O
the O
age O
of O
fourteen O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
late O
father O
, O
an O
agent O
for O
a O
foreign O
preserved O
milk O
firm O
, O
having O
given O
him O
an O
opening O
as O
office-boy O
, O
he O
was O
discovered O
one O
foggy O
afternoon O
, O
in O
his O
chief O
’s O
absence O
, O
busy O
letting O
off O
fireworks O
on O
the O
staircase O
. O
He O
touched O
off O
in O
quick O
succession O
a O
set O
of O
fierce O
rockets O
, O
angry O
catherine O
wheels O
, O
loudly O
exploding O
squibs O
— O
and O
the O
matter O
might O
have O
turned O
out O
very O
serious O
. O
An O
awful O
panic O
spread O
through O
the O
whole O
building O
. O
Wild-eyed O
, O
choking O
clerks O
stampeded O
through O
the O
passages O
full O
of O
smoke O
, O
silk O
hats O
and O
elderly O
business O
men O
could O
be O
seen O
rolling O
independently O
down O
the O
stairs O
. O
Stevie O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
derive O
any O
personal O
gratification O
from O
what O
he O
had O
done O
. O
His O
motives O
for O
this O
stroke O
of O
originality O
were O
difficult O
to O
discover O
. O
It O
was O
only O
later O
on O
that O
Winnie O
obtained O
from O
him O
a O
misty O
and O
confused O
confession O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
two O
other O
office-boys O
in O
the O
building O
had O
worked O
upon O
his O
feelings O
by O
tales O
of O
injustice O
and O
oppression O
till O
they O
had O
wrought O
his O
compassion O
to O
the O
pitch O
of O
that O
frenzy O
. O
But O
his O
father O
’s O
friend O
, O
of O
course O
, O
dismissed O
him O
summarily O
as O
likely O
to O
ruin O
his O
business O
. O
After O
that O
altruistic O
exploit O
Stevie O
was O
put O
to O
help O
wash O
the O
dishes O
in O
the O
basement O
kitchen O
, O
and O
to O
black O
the O
boots O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
patronising O
the O
Belgravian O
mansion O
. O
There O
was O
obviously O
no O
future O
in O
such O
work O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
tipped O
him O
a O
shilling O
now O
and O
then O
. O
Mr O
Verloc O
showed O
himself O
the O
most O
generous O
of O
lodgers O
. O
But O
altogether O
all O
that O
did O
not O
amount O
to O
much O
either O
in O
the O
way O
of O
gain O
or O
prospects O
; O
so O
that O
when O
Winnie O
announced O
her O
engagement O
to O
Mr O
Verloc O
her O
mother O
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O
and O
a O
glance O
towards O
the O
scullery O
, O
what O
would O
become O
of O
poor O
Stephen O
now O

ANTHONY PROP_PER
PATCH PROP_PER
In O
1913 O
, O
when O
Anthony PROP_PER
Patch PROP_PER
was O
twenty-five O
, O
two O
years O
were O
already O
gone O
since O
irony O
, O
the O
Holy O
Ghost O
of O
this O
later O
day O
, O
had O
, O
theoretically O
at O
least O
, O
descended O
upon O
him PRON_PER
. O
Irony O
was O
the O
final O
polish O
of O
the O
shoe O
, O
the O
ultimate O
dab O
of O
the O
clothes-brush O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
intellectual O
" O
There O
! O
" O
-- O
yet O
at O
the O
brink O
of O
this O
story O
he PRON_PER
has O
as O
yet O
gone O
no O
further O
than O
the O
conscious O
stage O
. O
As O
you PRON_PER
first O
see O
him PRON_PER
he PRON_PER
wonders O
frequently O
whether O
he PRON_PER
is O
not O
without O
honor O
and O
slightly O
mad O
, O
a O
shameful O
and O
obscene O
thinness O
glistening O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
world O
like O
oil O
on O
a O
clean O
pond O
, O
these O
occasions O
being O
varied O
, O
of O
course O
, O
with O
those O
in O
which O
he PRON_PER
thinks O
himself PRON_PER
rather O
an NOM_PER
exceptional NOM_PER
young NOM_PER
man NOM_PER
, O
thoroughly O
sophisticated O
, O
well O
adjusted O
to O
his PRON_PER
environment O
, O
and O
somewhat O
more O
significant O
than O
any NOM_PER
one NOM_PER
else NOM_PER
he NOM_PER
knows NOM_PER
. O
This O
was O
his O
healthy O
state O
and O
it O
made O
him O
cheerful O
, O
pleasant O
, O
and O
very O
attractive O
to O
intelligent O
men O
and O
to O
all O
women O
. O
In O
this O
state O
he O
considered O
that O
he O
would O
one O
day O
accomplish O
some O
quiet O
subtle O
thing O
that O
the O
elect O
would O
deem O
worthy O
and O
, O
passing O
on O
, O
would O
join O
the O
dimmer O
stars O
in O
a O
nebulous O
, O
indeterminate O
heaven O
half-way O
between O
death O
and O
immortality O
. O
Until O
the O
time O
came O
for O
this O
effort O
he O
would O
be O
Anthony O
Patch O
-- O
not O
a O
portrait O
of O
a O
man O
but O
a O
distinct O
and O
dynamic O
personality O
, O
opinionated O
, O
contemptuous O
, O
functioning O
from O
within O
outward O
-- O
a O
man O
who O
was O
aware O
that O
there O
could O
be O
no O
honor O
and O
yet O
had O
honor O
, O
who O
knew O
the O
sophistry O
of O
courage O
and O
yet O
was O
brave O
. O
A O
WORTHY O
MAN O
AND O
HIS O
GIFTED O
SON O
Anthony O
drew O
as O
much O
consciousness O
of O
social O
security O
from O
being O
the O
grandson O
of O
Adam O
J. O
Patch O
as O
he O
would O
have O
had O
from O
tracing O
his O
line O
over O
the O
sea O
to O
the O
crusaders O
. O
This O
is O
inevitable O
; O
Virginians O
and O
Bostonians O
to O
the O
contrary O
notwithstanding O
, O
an O
aristocracy O
founded O
sheerly O
on O
money O
postulates O
wealth O
in O
the O
particular O
. O
Now O
Adam O
J. O
Patch O
, O
more O
familiarly O
known O
as O
" O
Cross O
Patch O
, O
" O
left O
his O
father O
's O
farm O
in O
Tarrytown O
early O
in O
sixty-one O
to O
join O
a O
New O
York O
cavalry O
regiment O
. O
He O
came O
home O
from O
the O
war O
a O
major O
, O
charged O
into O
Wall O
Street O
, O
and O
amid O
much O
fuss O
, O
fume O
, O
applause O
, O
and O
ill O
will O
he O
gathered O
to O
himself O
some O
seventy-five O
million O
dollars O
. O
This O
occupied O
his O
energies O
until O
he O
was O
fifty-seven O
years O
old O
. O
It O
was O
then O
that O
he O
determined O
, O
after O
a O
severe O
attack O
of O
sclerosis O
, O
to O
consecrate O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
to O
the O
moral O
regeneration O
of O
the O
world O
. O
He O
became O
a O
reformer O
among O
reformers O
. O
Emulating O
the O
magnificent O
efforts O
of O
Anthony O
Comstock O
, O
after O
whom O
his O
grandson O
was O
named O
, O
he O
levelled O
a O
varied O
assortment O
of O
uppercuts O
and O
body-blows O
at O
liquor O
, O
literature O
, O
vice O
, O
art O
, O
patent O
medicines O
, O
and O
Sunday O
theatres O
. O
His O
mind O
, O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
that O
insidious O
mildew O
which O
eventually O
forms O
on O
all O
but O
the O
few O
, O
gave O
itself O
up O
furiously O
to O
every O
indignation O
of O
the O
age O
. O
From O
an O
armchair O
in O
the O
office O
of O
his O
Tarrytown O
estate O
he O
directed O
against O
the O
enormous O
hypothetical O
enemy O
, O
unrighteousness O
, O
a O
campaign O
which O
went O
on O
through O
fifteen O
years O
, O
during O
which O
he O
displayed O
himself O
a O
rabid O
monomaniac O
, O
an O
unqualified O
nuisance O
, O
and O
an O
intolerable O
bore O
. O
The O
year O
in O
which O
this O
story O
opens O
found O
him O
wearying O
; O
his O
campaign O
had O
grown O
desultory O
; O
1861 O
was O
creeping O
up O
slowly O
on O
1895 O
; O
his O
thoughts O
ran O
a O
great O
deal O
on O
the O
Civil O
War O
, O
somewhat O
on O
his O
dead O
wife O
and O
son O
, O
almost O
infinitesimally O
on O
his O
grandson O
Anthony O
. O
Early O
in O
his O
career O
Adam O
Patch O
had O
married O
an O
anemic O
lady O
of O
thirty O
, O
Alicia O
Withers O
, O
who O
brought O
him O
one O
hundred O
thousand O
dollars O
and O
an O
impeccable O
entré O
into O
the O
banking O
circles O
of O
New O
York O
. O
Immediately O
and O
rather O
spunkily O
she O
had O
borne O
him O
a O
son O
and O
, O
as O
if O
completely O
devitalized O
by O
the O
magnificence O
of O
this O
performance O
, O
she O
had O
thenceforth O
effaced O
herself O
within O
the O
shadowy O
dimensions O
of O
the O
nursery O
. O
The O
boy O
, O
Adam O
Ulysses O
Patch O
, O
became O
an O
inveterate O
joiner O
of O
clubs O
, O
connoisseur O
of O
good O
form O
, O
and O
driver O
of O
tandems O
-- O
at O
the O
astonishing O
age O
of O
twenty-six O
he O
began O
his O
memoirs O
under O
the O
title O
" O
New O
York O
Society O
as O
I O
Have O
Seen O
It O
. O
" O
On O
the O
rumor O
of O
its O
conception O
this O
work O
was O
eagerly O
bid O
for O
among O
publishers O
, O
but O
as O
it O
proved O
after O
his O
death O
to O
be O
immoderately O
verbose O
and O
overpoweringly O
dull O
, O
it O
never O
obtained O
even O
a O
private O
printing O
. O
This O
Fifth O
Avenue O
Chesterfield O
married O
at O
twenty-two O
. O
His O
wife O
was O
Henrietta O
Lebrune O
, O
the O
Boston O
" O
Society O
Contralto O
, O
" O
and O
the O
single O
child O
of O
the O
union O
was O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
his O
grandfather O
, O
christened O
Anthony O
Comstock O
Patch O
. O
When O
he O
went O
to O
Harvard O
, O
the O
Comstock O
dropped O
out O
of O
his O
name O
to O
a O
nether O
hell O
of O
oblivion O
and O
was O
never O
heard O
of O
thereafter O
. O
Young O
Anthony O
had O
one O
picture O
of O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
together O
-- O
so O
often O
had O
it O
faced O
his O
eyes O
in O
childhood O
that O
it O
had O
acquired O
the O
impersonality O
of O
furniture O
, O
but O
every O
one O
who O
came O
into O
his O
bedroom O
regarded O
it O
with O
interest O
. O
It O
showed O
a O
dandy O
of O
the O
nineties O
, O
spare O
and O
handsome O
, O
standing O
beside O
a O
tall O
dark O
lady O
with O
a O
muff O
and O
the O
suggestion O
of O
a O
bustle O
. O
Between O
them O
was O
a O
little O
boy O
with O
long O
brown O
curls O
, O
dressed O
in O
a O
velvet O
Lord O
Fauntleroy O
suit O
. O
This O
was O
Anthony O
at O
five O
, O
the O
year O
of O
his O
mother O
's O
death O
. O
His O
memories O
of O
the O
Boston O
Society O
Contralto O
were O
nebulous O
and O
musical O
. O
She O
was O
a O
lady O
who O
sang O
, O
sang O
, O
sang O
, O
in O
the O
music O
room O
of O
their O
house O
on O
Washington O
Square O
-- O
sometimes O
with O
guests O
scattered O
all O
about O
her O
, O
the O
men O
with O
their O
arms O
folded O
, O
balanced O
breathlessly O
on O
the O
edges O
of O
sofas O
, O
the O
women O
with O
their O
hands O
in O
their O
laps O
, O
occasionally O
making O
little O
whispers O
to O
the O
men O
and O
always O
clapping O
very O
briskly O
and O
uttering O
cooing O
cries O
after O
each O
song O
-- O
and O
often O
she O
sang O
to O
Anthony O
alone O
, O
in O
Italian O
or O
French O
or O
in O
a O
strange O
and O
terrible O
dialect O
which O
she O
imagined O
to O
be O
the O
speech O
of O
the O
Southern O
negro O
. O
His O
recollections O
of O
the O
gallant O
Ulysses O
, O
the O
first O
man O
in O
America O
to O
roll O
the O
lapels O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
were O
much O
more O
vivid O
. O
After O
Henrietta O
Lebrune O
Patch O
had O
" O
joined O
another O
choir O
, O
" O
as O
her O
widower O
huskily O
remarked O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
father O
and O
son O
lived O
up O
at O
grampa O
's O
in O
Tarrytown O
, O
and O
Ulysses O
came O
daily O
to O
Anthony O
's O
nursery O
and O
expelled O
pleasant O
, O
thick-smelling O
words O
for O
sometimes O
as O
much O
as O
an O
hour O
. O
He O
was O
continually O
promising O
Anthony O
hunting O
trips O
and O
fishing O
trips O
and O
excursions O
to O
Atlantic O
City O
, O
" O
oh O
, O
some O
time O
soon O
now O
" O
; O
but O
none O
of O
them O
ever O
materialized O
. O
One O
trip O
they O
did O
take O
; O
when O
Anthony O
was O
eleven O
they O
went O
abroad O
, O
to O
England O
and O
Switzerland O
, O
and O
there O
in O
the O
best O
hotel O
in O
Lucerne O
his O
father O
died O
with O
much O
sweating O
and O
grunting O
and O
crying O
aloud O
for O
air O
. O
In O
a O
panic O
of O
despair O
and O
terror O
Anthony O
was O
brought O
back O
to O
America O
, O
wedded O
to O
a O
vague O
melancholy O
that O
was O
to O
stay O
beside O
him O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
. O
PAST O
AND O
PERSON O
OF O
THE O
HERO O
At O
eleven O
he O
had O
a O
horror O
of O
death O
. O
Within O
six O
impressionable O
years O
his O
parents O
had O
died O
and O
his O
grandmother O
had O
faded O
off O
almost O
imperceptibly O
, O
until O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
her O
marriage O
, O
her O
person O
held O
for O
one O
day O
an O
unquestioned O
supremacy O
over O
her O
own O
drawing O
room O
. O
So O
to O
Anthony O
life O
was O
a O
struggle O
against O
death O
, O
that O
waited O
at O
every O
corner O
. O
It O
was O
as O
a O
concession O
to O
his O
hypochondriacal O
imagination O
that O
he O
formed O
the O
habit O
of O
reading O
in O
bed O
-- O
it O
soothed O
him O
. O
He O
read O
until O
he O
was O
tired O
and O
often O
fell O
asleep O
with O
the O
lights O
still O
on O
. O
His O
favorite O
diversion O
until O
he O
was O
fourteen O
was O
his O
stamp O
collection O
; O
enormous O
, O
as O
nearly O
exhaustive O
as O
a O
boy O
's O
could O
be O
-- O
his O
grandfather O
considered O
fatuously O
that O
it O
was O
teaching O
him O
geography O
. O
So O
Anthony O
kept O
up O
a O
correspondence O
with O
a O
half O
dozen O
" O
Stamp O
and O
Coin O
" O
companies O
and O
it O
was O
rare O
that O
the O
mail O
failed O
to O
bring O
him O
new O
stamp-books O
or O
packages O
of O
glittering O
approval O
sheets O
-- O
there O
was O
a O
mysterious O
fascination O
in O
transferring O
his O
acquisitions O
interminably O
from O
one O
book O
to O
another O
. O
His O
stamps O
were O
his O
greatest O
happiness O
and O
he O
bestowed O
impatient O
frowns O
on O
any O
one O
who O
interrupted O
him O
at O
play O
with O
them O
; O
they O
devoured O
his O
allowance O
every O
month O
, O
and O
he O
lay O
awake O
at O
night O
musing O
untiringly O
on O
their O
variety O
and O
many-colored O
splendor O
. O
At O
sixteen O
he O
had O
lived O
almost O
entirely O
within O
himself O
, O
an O
inarticulate O
boy O
, O
thoroughly O
un-American O
, O
and O
politely O
bewildered O
by O
his O
contemporaries O
. O
The O
two O
preceding O
years O
had O
been O
spent O
in O
Europe O
with O
a O
private O
tutor O
, O
who O
persuaded O
him O
that O
Harvard O
was O
the O
thing O
; O
it O
would O
" O
open O
doors O
, O
" O
it O
would O
be O
a O
tremendous O
tonic O
, O
it O
would O
give O
him O
innumerable O
self-sacrificing O
and O
devoted O
friends O
. O
So O
he O
went O
to O
Harvard O
-- O
there O
was O
no O
other O
logical O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
with O
him O
. O
Oblivious O
to O
the O
social O
system O
, O
he O
lived O
for O
a O
while O
alone O
and O
unsought O
in O
a O
high O
room O
in O
Beck O
Hall O
-- O
a O
slim O
dark O
boy O
of O
medium O
height O
with O
a O
shy O
sensitive O
mouth O
. O
His O
allowance O
was O
more O
than O
liberal O
. O
He O
laid O
the O
foundations O
for O
a O
library O
by O
purchasing O
from O
a O
wandering O
bibliophile O
first O
editions O
of O
Swinburne O
, O
Meredith O
, O
and O
Hardy O
, O
and O
a O
yellowed O
illegible O
autograph O
letter O
of O
Keats O
's O
, O
finding O
later O
that O
he O
had O
been O
amazingly O
overcharged O
. O
He O
became O
an O
exquisite O
dandy O
, O
amassed O
a O
rather O
pathetic O
collection O
of O
silk O
pajamas O
, O
brocaded O
dressing-gowns O
, O
and O
neckties O
too O
flamboyant O
to O
wear O
; O
in O
this O
secret O
finery O
he O
would O
parade O
before O
a O
mirror O
in O
his O
room O
or O
lie O
stretched O
in O
satin O
along O
his O
window-seat O
looking O
down O
on O
the O
yard O
and O
realizing O
dimly O
this O
clamor O
, O
breathless O
and O
immediate O
, O
in O
which O
it O
seemed O
he O
was O
never O
to O
have O
a O
part O
. O
Curiously O
enough O
he O
found O
in O
senior O
year O
that O
he O
had O
acquired O
a O
position O
in O
his O
class O
. O
He O
learned O
that O
he O
was O
looked O
upon O
as O
a O
rather O
romantic O
figure O
, O
a O
scholar O
, O
a O
recluse O
, O
a O
tower O
of O
erudition O
. O
This O
amused O
him O
but O
secretly O
pleased O
him O
-- O
he O
began O
going O
out O
, O
at O
first O
a O
little O
and O
then O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
He O
made O
the O
Pudding O
. O
He O
drank O
-- O
quietly O
and O
in O
the O
proper O
tradition O
. O
It O
was O
said O
of O
him O
that O
had O
he O
not O
come O
to O
college O
so O
young O
he O
might O
have O
" O
done O
extremely O
well O
. O
" O
In O
1909 O
, O
when O
he O
graduated O
, O
he O
was O
only O
twenty O
years O
old O
. O
Then O
abroad O
again O
-- O
to O
Rome O
this O
time O
, O
where O
he O
dallied O
with O
architecture O
and O
painting O
in O
turn O
, O
took O
up O
the O
violin O
, O
and O
wrote O
some O
ghastly O
Italian O
sonnets O
, O
supposedly O
the O
ruminations O
of O
a O
thirteenth-century O
monk O
on O
the O
joys O
of O
the O
contemplative O
life O
. O
It O
became O
established O
among O
his O
Harvard O
intimates O
that O
he O
was O
in O
Rome O
, O
and O
those O
of O
them O
who O
were O
abroad O
that O
year O
looked O
him O
up O
and O
discovered O
with O
him O
, O
on O
many O
moonlight O
excursions O
, O
much O
in O
the O
city O
that O
was O
older O
than O
the O
Renaissance O
or O
indeed O
than O
the O
republic O
. O
Maury O
Noble O
, O
from O
Philadelphia O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
remained O
two O
months O
, O
and O
together O
they O
realized O
the O
peculiar O
charm O
of O
Latin O
women O
and O
had O
a O
delightful O
sense O
of O
being O
very O
young O
and O
free O
in O
a O
civilization O
that O
was O
very O
old O
and O
free O
. O
Not O
a O
few O
acquaintances O
of O
his O
grandfather O
's O
called O
on O
him O
, O
and O
had O
he O
so O
desired O
he O
might O
have O
been O
_ O
persona O
grata O
_ O
with O
the O
diplomatic O
set O
-- O
indeed O
, O
he O
found O
that O
his O
inclinations O
tended O
more O
and O
more O
toward O
conviviality O
, O
but O
that O
long O
adolescent O
aloofness O
and O
consequent O
shyness O
still O
dictated O
to O
his O
conduct O
. O
